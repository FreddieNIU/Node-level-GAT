The S&amp;P 500 is up 16.7% year-to-date and the tech-heavy NASDAQ gained 31.3%. This recovery was unexpected by analysts, given the sharp decline in stock values in 2022.

Analysts recommend that investors should keep adding dividend stocks to their portfolios, as these stocks are expected to show growth in the second half of the year. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson Investors, reviewed the first half of 2023 and presented a positive outlook on dividend stocks. He said that so far this year, dividends have been increasing, boosted by special dividends and share buybacks. Cash generation is still robust with many larger companies transferring the added expenses due to inflation to their customers. He further highlighted that the dividend outlook is strong. However, as the impact of increased interest rates affects both companies and consumers, it's important to diversify investments and prioritize companies with solid financial standings.

The company says the $7.3 billion offer was ""unreasonable"" and that it is reviewing ""strategic alternatives."" Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Ines Ferre breaks down the stocks' reaction.Video Transcript- The United States Steel stock is soaring, and we've got news that it rejected a $7.3 billion buyout proposal from rival, Cleveland-Cliffs. It's exploring strategic alternatives after receiving what it says are multiple unsolicited offers from organizations looking to invest in or take over the steelmaker.Joining us now on this, Yahoo Finance reporter, Ines Ferre. And this was sort of out of the blue but it's been an interesting story this morning to track.It's been very interesting. And we don't talk that much about steel. Now this proposal was a proposal that was private, from Cleveland-Cliffs, to acquire US Steel. It was made privately back in late July. And it was made public by cleveland-cliffs after it was rejected with US Steel, calling it unreasonable. US Steel writing a letter, a public letter.One of the issues addressed in that letter which US Steel CEO, David Burritt, sent to Cleveland-Cliffs is the clarity over regulatory risks, the merger would have created the largest US Steel company in North America, and one of the largest in the world. Now Cliffs has made some acquisitions in recent years, which has made the company into the largest producer of flat-rolled steel in North America.Now, flat-rolled steel is used for products like car doors, like filing cabinets, like tables. Now, Cliffs is a major player in the car industry. And this move to consolidate is important because steel producers are betting that the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed last year, that investment in green energy, infrastructure, all of that, will benefit steel makers.Now, why US Steel? The company, founded in 1901, it was a DAO component since it went public in 1901, has undergone a big shift in recent years under CEO, David Burritt, focusing on more modern cost-efficient plants. And Burrit became CEO of US Steel back in 2017 and purchased Big River Steel in Arkansas.Story continuesNow, on Friday, US Steel had closed at $22.72 a share. You can see right now, it's trading at 28.90. And just some reaction from the street, basically you have some analysts that are saying, look, this is unprobable that this will happened. You have a KeyBank analyst, Philip Gibbs, saying that the probability of a deal without meaningful concessions is low. Also, you have Citi analyst, Alexander Hacking, saying that Cleveland-Cliffs is really the only logical acquirer for 100% of US Steel. But the value, he says, should be more around $46 a share.Now what Cliffs was offering was $35 a share. This analyst is saying it's a little bit opportunistic, this bid that was made. If you take a look at a year-to-date chart, now it's up year-to-date, but prior to this proposal being made public, it had been down year-to-date today. All these steel makers really flying pretty high.- Yeah, we'll see if there ends up being a deal. Thanks so much, Ines. Appreciate it.]"

Aflac Incorporated AFL, Unum Group UNM, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF should continue to benefit from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers’ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claim costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers’ compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates continue to trend downward.Claims Frequency to Improve: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs. Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the degree of severity, the report states.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #37, which places it in the top 15% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.

PacWest agreed to merge with rival Bank of California (BANC) in late July in a deal set to close next year.In the first quarter, Burry spent more than $23 million betting on financial stocks during a quarter in which Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, and Silvergate all went under in a matter of days.Scion also closed out positions in Capital One (COF) and Wells Fargo (WFC), both of which were opened during the first quarter of this year.Scion also trimmed 76% of its holdings in New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), the regional lender which acquired $38.4 billion in assets belonging to Signature Bank from the FDIC in a $2.7 billion deal.During the second quarter, the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) fell about 7%, lagging the broader Financial (XLF) sector and the S&amp;P 500, which rose 5.4% and 8.4%, respectively, over the same period.Shares of Western Alliance rose about 5.5% during the second quarter, while Huntington stock fell about 2% and PacWest dropped 13%, a move that came before the company's merger announcement.During the second quarter, Scion also sold out of its positions in Chinese e-commerce and tech companies Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).Scion did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the investments.Burry gained fame for his moves during the 2008 crisis, in which he predicted and then profited from a collapse in residential real estate prices as early as 2007.

In 2001, she took on the role, which mostly focused on event planning and project management.""I definitely was an accidental banker but fell in love with the industry and began to take on new opportunities,"" she said.In 2004, Garten, who grew up in Cleveland and attended Ohio University a few hours down the road, relocated to Seattle as an entry-level credit analyst. She served in that role for one year and met a female mentor through an internal development network focused on powering employees to connect across business lines and geographies. The mentor helped Garten create a development plan.""It definitely was a blessing to work with great leadership who saw something in me and pushed me,"" Garten said. ""I took some risks and that's where you learn a lot about yourself, particularly when you move to a new city or into a new position where you must learn everything from ground zero. Leadership helped me realize my potential.""In 2006, she took on a client manager position and started to get a taste of leadership. She moved on to a sales manager job for several years and then into a Business Banking position in 2016 that required her to move with her husband and two young children to Los Angeles.Within three years, she was able to move back to her Cleveland hometown to serve as market leader for Cleveland and Columbus. In 2022, U.S. Bank named Garten the Branch Banking Indiana-Ohio Market Leader, overseeing 210 branches.Story continues""My greatest advice is for people to trust their gut when it comes to their career path,"" she said. ""I never knew what the next step would look like. I find my joy in connecting with clients and our team, and watching people grow, develop and succeed. It's important to figure out what makes you the happiest.""Serving customers - and tennis balls When she's not traveling across Indiana and Ohio visiting with branch banking teams, Garten spends a lot of time on the tennis courts. While she didn't start playing until 2018, Garten already earned a spot to U.S. Tennis Association's NTRP National Championships in San Diego with her doubles partner at the 3.0 level.""We did really well in the playoffs, winning our quarterfinal, semifinal and final match to win our playoff flight,"" she said. ""Overall, we left San Diego with a 3-3 record for our first Nationals experience and certainly look to earn a spot next year.""Garten is a member of the Cleveland Racquet Club, where she captains teams and met who she considers an amazing group of women.""I think sports and leadership are intertwined in so many ways, especially in a sport like tennis where the mindset is more important at times than the skill or fitness level,"" she said. ""With sports, you learn how to win and lose with grace, how to be fair, how to problem-solve and how to adapt."" Playing tennis is the ultimate stress reliever, she said.""Tennis provides an outlet where I can channel my competitiveness in a healthy manner. I also love clothes and fashion, so to me it's a match made in heaven.""Garten's involvement with local tennis provides her with opportunities to teach and inspire her two young daughters. It also enables her to give back to the community and get U.S. Bank involved through organizations that include the Cleveland School District. In August, U.S. Bank will sponsor the Women in Business Forum during Tennis in the Land, which is part of the U.S. Open Series on the Women's Tennis Association schedule.""Last year, 250 emerging leaders attended and that's expected to nearly double this year,"" Garten said. ""It's a great way to connect with women.""And just like in banking, tennis is a long game.""I play a lot of doubles where you really have to be in lockstep with your partner and collaborate on the court,"" Garten said. ""There's an element of teamwork like what you find day-to-day at work. Also, where are you putting the ball on the court? You must set yourself up for success.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/773992/From-Administrative-Assistant-to-Market-Leader-A-Coast-to-Coast-Career-Path]"

Companies that have earned a VPP Star designation have achieved injury and illness rates at or below the national average of their respective industries and have established strong workplace hazard control programs.&gt;&gt; Media Use Assets (available on Dropbox)During the presentation, Michael Smith, the location's General Manager, accepted the honor on his team's behalf.""Being recognized by the Ohio Board with VPP Star certification is a tremendous honor for us,"" Smith said. ""We have dedicated employee-partners at our location, and they are invested in maintaining a safe workplace for each other. Gaining VPP certification was a long, thorough process, but it means so much to everyone here at this operation.""OSHA established VPP to promote effective and cooperative worksite safety and health in both private industry and at federal worksites.Achieving VPP certification is rigorous. Businesses must demonstrate that management and employees work cooperatively - and proactively - to prevent workplace accidents by implementing a comprehensive safety and health management system and maintaining injury and illness rates below national Bureau of Labor Statistic averages for their respective industries.This program is OSHA's official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.

To skip our detailed analysis of conservative investing in the current market, you can go directly to see the Conservative Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks To Buy.Markets are jittery again amid analyst firms downgrading banks and some circles still warning about recession despite inflation showing some signs of cooling. At the same time, the US is going through a rough patch in terms of its debt rating, what with the Fitch Ratings downgrading US debt from AAA to AA+, a move that was claimed to be influenced by deteriorating governance standards. The US financial sector is also facing yet another challenge, with Moody's this time downgrading about 11 US banks while taking 16 other negative rating actions on other regional banks in the country. All of these moves have come about in close succession to one another in July and August, putting the everyday investor in a frantic state of mind when it comes to figuring out where they can put their money and be able to rest easy.What Is Conservative Investing?Considering the above, there are many investors today who are looking for safe and reliable stock options to beef up their portfolios and ensure they aren't hit too hard by worrying market conditions. Because of this, conservative investing is a strategy that is coming to the forefront. This strategy entails a defensive investment style with a focus on low-risk investments. The aim of the strategy is to achieve capital security while providing investors with steady and reliable income and protection for their invested capital. Many investors look at reliable dividend stocks as part of this strategy since these stocks offer steady passive income that can tide them by in volatile markets. Blue chip stocks, or generally renowned companies with solid balance sheets and financial strength, are also top picks for conservative stock portfolios.Story continuesWhile building a conservative stock portfolio in the second half of 2023, investors can take a look at several sectors that have been performing well and are expected to continue this level of performance later in the year as well. These include the tech and consumer staples sectors and even the healthcare sector, among others. On August 14, Paul Meeks, a tech investor and portfolio manager at Independent Solutions Wealth Management, was invited to CNBC's TechCheck, and he said the following about the tech sector in particular:""What I've seen is that there were a number of tech stocks that deserved to have big 2023 ramps, and there were a number of tech stocks that probably were frauds that didn't deserve it. And so unfortunately, the whole sector got grossly overbought, and now we're starting to see some reality, we're starting to see some consolidation, and I actually think that consolidation might continue a bit further.""Buying Opportunities In TechMeeks' insights on the tech sector can prove valuable to any conservative investors looking to buy into this sector today since he clearly lays out the ground reality of the sector by stating that stocks within this area have been overbought by eager investors. Despite this, Meeks stated that while tech weakness is expected to continue, he does see a ""buying opportunity"" in some tech names. The mega-cap stocks Meeks is favoring so far include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). He sees further upside for these stocks and several others in the tech sector today.However, conservative investors should keep in mind that tech is not the only sector they can invest in at this point. While it has been overwhelmingly dominating market discourse so far this year, other sectors, such as healthcare and consumer staples, are also equally good conservative plays because of their historical performance and reliability, especially in times of recession. Considering these factors, we have compiled a list of some of the best conservative stocks to buy today. By following lists like these, investors can build up conservative stock portfolios full of some of the best stocks to buy for long-term gains as well. Additionally, these names can also be considered some of the top safe stocks to buy for beginner investors today.Conservative Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks To BuyPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 10 conservative (safe, reliable and defensive) stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc.

Over 90% of the S&amp;P 500 has reported but that doesn’t mean it’s over. You know what happens at the end of earnings season: the retailers. And this earnings season is no different.We’ll hear from some of the largest retailers in the United States this week. They mostly have good earnings surprise track records. Management is used to telegraphing to analysts the trends in the business. But many of the retailers have had problems in the last year with excess inventory. They ordered too much and consumer demand changed from goods to experiences, like travel.Have retailers worked through their inventory issues in time for Back to School and the winter holidays?And will these reports support the “soft landing” argument?Target and 4 Other Key Retail Earnings Charts1.    Home Depot (HD) has only missed one time in the last 5 years and it was when the pandemic first started, in 2020. That’s impressive given what has happened since 2020 with supply chain and inventory issues. Shares of Home Depot are up just 4.8% year-to-date, which is underperforming the S&amp;P 500 which has gained 16.4%. But is it foolish to count out Home Depot?2.    Target Corp. (TGT) has beat 2 quarters in a row after posting 3 big misses. Shares of Target have fallen 12.1% year-to-date, which is under performing. Target is paying a dividend, yielding 3.3%. Is this a buying opportunity in Target?3.    TJX Companies (TJX) has beat 5 quarters in a row. Shares of TJX Companies are up 7.9% year-to-date but don’t be fooled by the under performance. It’s trading at new 5-year highs. TJX Companies had solid comparable sales in all of its segments last quarter except Home Goods, which is normalizing off of the pandemic demand. Will TJX Companies breakout with another earnings beat?4.    Walmart Inc. (WMT) has beat 4 quarters in a row. The Street is bullish on Walmart as shares are up 13.7% year-to-date and are at 5-year highs. Walmart isn’t cheap, on a P/E basis. It trades at 25.8x. Will another beat be an earnings catalyst for Walmart?Story continues5.    Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST) has beat 4 quarters in a row. Yet shares of Ross Stores are down 2.3% year-to-date.

The company has already rejected a bid from Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF). Now Esmark, a privately held company, says its made a $35 per share offer for the steel giant. Walmart (WMT) shares closed lower after hitting a record high earlier in trading after Evercore added the retailer to its outperform list. Shares of Okta (OKTA) rose after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock from ""sell"" to ""buy."" Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the news on some of the top trending tickers.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, let's take a look at where shares of US Steel closed on the day. The company is saying that it's getting a lot of interest of takeover interest, already declining an offer from Cleveland-Cliffs over the weekend. Within the last hour, Esmark announced an offer of 35 bucks a share for US Steel, really trumping the offer from Cleveland-Cliffs that had been put out over the weekend.We're seeing some of that reaction within the stock, Akiko, of US Steel today closing up just about 36%. But certainly, will be interesting to see how all of this plays out at Cleveland-Cliffs earlier in the day saying that they are still confident that their takeover offer will succeed because they do have the support of a key Union here at the United Steelworkers Union. But again, this offer here from Esmark showing that there is a heck a lot of interest within the space.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Esmark by the way, run by a former US Steel executive. But as we see this all playing out. I mean, no question. It looks like this is all shaping up to be a bit of a bidding war for US Steel, and that's why you're seeing those shares moving higher.No matter where this or how this plays out, it will-- no question sort of mark a dramatic shifting of the landscape within the steel industry in the US. When you think about the space that we are watching here, I mean, Cleveland-Cliffs, obviously a leader when it comes to flat steel.Story continuesWe're talking about steel that's been used in products like cars, and Esmark as well competing in that space. But, you know, it'd be interesting to see ultimately, you know, how that M&amp;A breaks down.Because to your point, Seana, earlier, there's also questions about antitrust and you know whether, in fact, if there's any deal that's announced, how much of that would actually go through. But also, the US was trying to join forces in order to compete on a global level with those giants coming out of China as well.We're watching shares of Walmart. The stock closing down on the day after hitting a record high earlier in the session. Evercore, putting the stock on its outperform list, heading into earnings. And Stifel, who has a hold on the stock, raised its price target to $167 a share. No question there. There is a lot of optimism, a lot of expectations riding on these numbers coming out from Walmart.But Seana, in many ways, it does line up with what we have heard over and over about the American consumer right now-- how cautious. they are turning. How they're turning away from discretionary spending, really spending on core products here, like fresh foods. Walmart positioned from a place of strength, when you consider all those factors.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And I think that story is also told just within the analyst action that we saw today. You mentioned Evercore adding Walmart to their outperform list. The price target raise that we got there and that contrasts to some of the price target cuts that we got for its rival target today ahead of their results, which are also later this week.Piper Sandler cutting their price target on Target. But when it comes to Walmart, Akiko, you're exactly right. Just given their strong position right now, given the fact that there has been such a massive focus on value pricing, obviously, a focus here that gives Walmart an edge within this category. It gives it-- really positions it as a winner here, heading into these results.Evercore which did add Walmart to its outperform list, expecting a beat and raise quarter. Basing that on strong traffic. Also, they expect to see margin recovery. So we'll get those results later on this week.Okta has also been a trending ticker on Yahoo Finance today. The stock getting a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs, the analysts saying that the tech company could see a turnaround in subscription growth and stabilization of its workforce segment.We're looking at gains of just about 1% for the day. But when it comes to that subscription growth here, Goldman saying that they expect that acceleration in revenue from 14% in the second half of fiscal year, 2023, to 15%-20% in 2024. They also see Okta taking a larger share from more legacy vendors here.So given the underperformance relative to some of its peers since the start of the year, the stock only up just about 5%, nearly 6%. Goldman Sachs at least sees a turning point here for Okta going forward.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Looking at that price target up from $77 a share to $91 a share. You talked about some of the competition coming in from legacy players, Goldman Sachs specifically saying, we believe competition from Microsoft will remain an overhang on the stock. But we reflect this in our bull case scenario, by continuing to discount Okta's multiple by 30% relative to peers.A number of factors there driving this. You talked about subscription growth, stabilization in the workforce segment, but also some new products that they have introduced to really ramp up and drive additional revenue.]"

However, it’s noteworthy that Home Depot has surpassed earnings expectations for 12 consecutive quarters, dating back to August of 2020. On the top line, second-quarter sales are forecasted to be down -3% to $42.25 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWMT Q2 Preview: Walmart recently hit a new 52-week high today with mixed results expected in its Q2 report on Thursday.Wall Street will be seeing if consumers are still leaning towards Walmart for savings over other omni-channel retailers like Target TGT even as inflation begins to ease. Notably, the preference for Walmart among the consumer masses has been reflected in their stocks. Target stock is still 30% from its 52-week highs and has kept falling in contrast to shares of WMT.Walmart's Q2 earnings are expected to be down -5% at $1.68 per share compared to EPS of $1.77 in the prior-year quarter. This is despite Q2 sales projected to be up 4% to $159.71 billion. Plus, Walmart has topped earnings expectations in its last four quarterly reports. The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) also indicates Walmart may be able to top earnings estimates again with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS at $1.70 and 1% above the Zacks Consensus.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; Outlook Home Depot’s annual earnings are now expected to be down -10% in its current fiscal 2024 at $14.97 per share compared to $16.99 a share in FY23. Fiscal 2025 earnings are expected to stabilize and rebound 7%. Furthermore, FY25 EPS projections of $16.01 per share would still represent 23% growth over the last five years with earnings at $12.03 a share in fiscal 2021.Story continuesWhile not overwhelming, this is respectable growth for a mature company of Home Depot’s size. Total sales are forecasted to dip -3% in FY24 but stabilize and rise 2% in FY25 to $155.07 billion. Fiscal 2025 sales would be a 17% increase over the last five years with FY21 sales at $132.11 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTurning to Walmart, annual earnings are expected to be virtually flat in its current FY24 and then rise 11% in FY25 to $6.92 per share. Fiscal 2025 EPS projections would represent 26% growth over the last five years with FY21 earnings at $5.48 a share.Even better, Walmart’s total sales are anticipated to be up 4% in FY24 and rise another 3% in FY25 to $660.63 billion. Fiscal 2025 projections would be an 18% increase over the last five years with FY21 sales at $559.15 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway Going into their second-quarter reports, Walmart stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with Home Depot landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Overall, the growth of these retail giants is still attractive and Walmart stands out ahead of its Q2 results with the Zacks ESP indicating the company should beat earnings expectations.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

RapidRatings Executive Chairman James Gellert and Unity Marketing President-Founder Pamela Danziger joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the state of the retail industry right now. Gellert says smaller, private retailers are being ""much more squeezed"" than their larger counterparts.Danziger, meanwhile, says ""the biggest question right now for retailers is consumer spending."" Danziger points to a recent report from the National Retail Federation that warns consumer spending is slowing and that ""we're really looking at, I think, a very potentially contracted environment for retailers coming up in the last half of the year.""Click here to see more from the Yahoo Finance series ""Retail Evolution: The New Era.""Video Transcript- Number of the big box retailers will be releasing earnings giving investors a chance to see how the sector has fared. Now, it's no surprise that retailers have been given the amount of attention that it has with a myriad of challenges, including inflation, wage growth, and supply chains.Now, data from Epiq Bankruptcy shows all is still not rosy. The number of commercial chapter 11 filings registered in July increased 71%. Overall, commercial filings increased 21% in the same period. And small business filings increased 61% to 153 in July. Now, that's up from 95 in July of 2022. The total number of bankruptcy filings topped 35,000, indicating the economic recovery is still uneven.Let's bring in now RapidRatings Executive Chairman, James Gellert, as well as Unity Marketing Founder and President, Pamela Danziger, to discuss this more. Big welcome to you both here. So James, I want to start with you here because as we talk about the metrics that you use in your ratings here, who are you seeing as the big winners and losers so far?JAMES GELLERT: So good to be with you and Pamela, you as well. You just put up some very sobering statistics, and I think it frames out the conversation really well. We have a significant increase in bankruptcies and defaults but we have moreover, a ton of pressure on a lot of industries, retail being one of them. We look at financial statements of public and private companies to evaluate the financial health and core health, which is a longer term measure of businesses.Story continuesAnd what we have found since the end of 2021 is that retail is our second most declining sector. It is of 28 sectors the lowest that we have rated at the moment at a 61 on our 100 point scale, which compares to all of our coverage for public companies of a 55. So it's slightly better, but it is down 6.7 points since the end of 21.Really, the big issue here, two big issues. One, private companies in the sector. Smaller companies, mid-sized businesses and retail are being much more squeezed than their public counterparties, and the leveraged position of companies is going to be the big story over the next six months but really, the next probably 24.- And Pam, as we look at the landscape as a whole, obviously, you have interest rates. Incredibly tough if you're trying to refinance as a business. What are some of the retailers, when you look at that landscape, what are they telling you are their biggest issues?PAMELA DANZIGER: Well, I think one of the biggest question right now for retailers is consumer spending. And when NRF just came out and announced that consumer spending is slowing, that is something that everybody should take notice of because just a month ago, they were saying that they had revised data that showed that there was underlying strength in the economy that was going to roll forward.But right now, they're seeing something in their signals and their signs that say spending is down, and that's going to put back-to-school shopping at risk. And back-to-school shopping is a bellwether of what's ahead for Christmas and holiday shopping. So we're really looking at a really, I think, a very potentially contracted environment for retailers coming up the last half of the year.- And James, when you look at some of the rising debt levels for these retailers here, are there certain companies that are managing this debt better than others, especially when you look at this spike that we're seeing in bankruptcies?JAMES GELLERT: Well, you've got the largest companies in the space, the Walmarts of the world, Target. Walmart rated at 68, Target rated at 63. These are strong ratings in the grand scheme of things. And they will continue to have access to the capital markets perhaps with slight variations on funding costs. But it's again, the smaller companies and to Pamela's point, the ones that are more susceptible and exposed to some of the vagaries of maybe consumer spending habits for non-discretionary or rather for discretionary items.So you look at the companies like a Wayfair, for instance, with an FHR of 20 and overstock has dropped recently to a 41. These are companies that have been able to manage their debt reasonably well by kicking the can down the road and refinancing. But as their maturities begin to come due, they will certainly have more pressure on them.And for contrast, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond when it filed for bankruptcy was rated at 25. Tuesday morning at 25, Party City in 18. So companies in the 40 and below range are in the highest risk of failing historically, and those are the ones that we're seeing continue to flash a lot of red lights.- And Pam, as you look at this issue of what we're seeing with a potential recession coming down the road, you also have student loan debt repayments about to kick in. So that's even less discretionary income as well. When you look at that outcome there, when you look at the bigger companies versus the value plays, what sort of environment should we be looking at timeline-wise?PAMELA DANZIGER: Well, that's a question that nobody has an answer for, but I think we're seeing increasingly 2024 is going to be tough. And again, if the retailer-- if consumers pull back as I expect them to-- and we talk about credit. The consumer credit cards are maxed out now. They owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt, so that's taking a bigger chunk of their discretionary spending out.So I think we're looking at an environment next year that whether or not we have a recession, I think we're going to be in a place of stagflation, like remember back from the 70s, with smaller retailers more at risk from declining consumer spending.- And James, when you look at how much the consumer has changed, obviously, a lot of these companies are trying to get a handle on what the consumer wants. We saw the backlog when it came with inventory. What do you think is going to be the next catalyst for retailers as you give an outlook?JAMES GELLERT: The story for the last couple of years has been supply chain. The story for the next couple of years will continue to be supply chain. Now, the companies that have the greatest access to supply ahead and are able to plan for consumer spending changes over the coming quarters are really the ones that are going to be best positioned. The ones that have less resilient supply chains, don't have as much insight into the goods that they're buying or have suffered disruptions of one kind or another, they're the ones that are going to have a trickier time managing consumer preferences.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond again is a great example of a company that really lost the confidence of its suppliers as it was facing a lot of its problems. And then of course, lost the confidence of its consumers as they would show up to stores and not see the goods on the shelves that they wanted.But as you go upstream in supply chains, you have smaller and smaller and more often private companies that are highly exposed to the rising interest rate environments and floating rate debt because they tend to be more bank borrowers than they are long-term bond issuers. So in their cases, the cost of capital have increased on top of the costs of labor and the costs of goods. So they're the ones who are more impinged, and they can't necessarily pass those costs through to their ultimate customers or the larger retailers that they're selling to. Those are the ones that are really going to be at the most risk over the next 24 months.- So Pam, until we see interest rates start to come down and consumers feel more comfortable here, is anything else really going to change this situation? What is a new normal going to look like after being so comfortable with historically low interest rates for so long and now these bankruptcies continuing to pile up?PAMELA DANZIGER: Yeah, well, I think the word-- and I remember the '70s, I think the word is going to be kind of a stagflation. People are going to put off buying discretionary products and making discretionary purchases. I mean, already, LVMH, Kering, Richemont, Prada, and Burberry already saw reduced spending in the US on luxury goods. And luxury is the most discretionary of purchases, and it's the one that is most easily put off. So I see them-- I see luxury is also threatened and in a bad place right now from what's happening with consumers.- And James, that's interesting because we know that for at least most of the post-pandemic, luxury spending was pretty resilient here. As you look at perhaps some of these luxury retailers versus the value plays, who do you see then as perhaps coming out on top? As we are starting to see some of those cracks in the luxury spending market.JAMES GELLERT: Well so, I think the winners here are-- luxury has a place and will continue to have a reasonably well-supported customer group. But it will vary from quarter to quarter as Pamela has just rightly pointed out.But a big issue I think we will see going forward is acquisition and event risk among these names. So we're already beginning to see some consolidation in the industry. I believe we will see more of that. And there's a whole world of private capital, both private equity and private credit that has a lot of dry powder and has been a bit on the sidelines more than at least over the last 10 years over this past year. And this past year, the dry powder just continues to build up.So more private equity firms are going to get into the space and beginning to look to crank up some of the brands that may be strong brands historically but running into a little bit of a challenge from a financial perspective today. And we'll see a lot more of that coming up for the balance of this year and in '24.- I do appreciate you both joining us this morning here. A big thank you there to RapidRatings Executive Chairman, James Gellert, as well as Unity Marketing Founder and President, Pamela Danziger. Thank you both.]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $25,556 million, indicating a decrease of about 1.9% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this general merchandise retailer is anticipated to have increased year over year. Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter under review has declined by a couple of cents to $1.48 over the past seven days, it suggests a sharp increase from earnings of 39 cents reported in the year-ago period.Target has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 4.9%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Minneapolis, MN-based company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.8%.Key Things to NoteConsumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown signs of slowing down. Several factors have come into play, including underlying inflationary pressure, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings. Target might have witnessed soft demand for discretionary products, partly offset by sustained strength in essentials.Based on soft first-quarter sales trends, Target guided a low-single-digit-decline in comparable sales for the second quarter. We projected a comparable sales decline of 2.1% for the quarter under discussion.Besides, management guided greater SG&amp;A rate pressure in the second quarter. As a result, the operating margin rate is likely to decrease on a sequential basis. We anticipate a 120-basis points decline in the operating margin on a sequential basis. However, on a year-over-year basis, we estimate a 280-basis points improvement in the operating margin.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Target Corporation QuoteAs a result, the bottom line is expected to showcase year-over-year growth. For the second quarter, the company guided adjusted earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.70 per share, up sharply from 39 cents reported in the year-ago period.Markedly, management has been undertaking cost-control measures, such as working with vendors and driving continued operational efficiencies. The company’s digital endeavors, store investments and merchandise actions to gain market share are expected to have aided its performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Target this time.

China is the world's biggest oil importer.China's central bank lowered interest rates marginally after the data that highlighted intensifying pressure on the economy, mainly from the property sector, though analysts say the cut was too small to make a meaningful difference.There are concerns China could struggle to meet its growth target of about 5% for the year without more fiscal stimulus.Barclays cut its forecast for China's 2023 growth in gross domestic product to 4.5%, citing a faster-than-expected deterioration in the housing market.Also adding to risk-off sentiment, an analyst at Fitch Ratings warned that U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase, could be downgraded if the agency further cuts its assessment of the operating environment for the industry, according to a report from CNBC.Story continues""When the banking sector is shaky, oil gets shakier because it is so sensitive to interest rates, loans and the general health of the economy,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group.On a brighter note, refinery throughput in China rose in July 17.4% from a year earlier as refiners kept output elevated to meet demand for domestic summer travel and to cash in on high regional profit margins by exporting fuel.In U.S. supply, crude stocks dropped by about 6.2 million barrels last week, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures released late Tuesday. [API/S]Ahead of weekly government data due on Wednesday, analysts polled by Reuters estimated on average that crude inventories fell by about 2.3 million barrels last week.

Blue Line Futures President Bill Baruch tells Yahoo Finance Live that China is continuing to import crude at near-record levels. ""I think that if China picks up a bit, then this is some of the worst news being priced in,"" Baruch said.Video Transcript- Concern over China's economic recovery pressuring oil prices. Today we had crude pulling back after recording seven straight weeks of gains. Despite today's pressure, though, oil is still holding above 80 bucks a barrel and demand expected to remain at high levels for the rest of the year.So where are prices headed? We want to bring in Bill Baruch, President of Blue Line Futures. Bill, it's good to see you again. So here we are, just above 82 bucks a barrel. Lots of forecasts out there about rising demand. The fact that it's not going to stop anytime soon, at least for the next several months. What does that mean for crude prices?BILL BARUCH: You know, they're hanging up pretty good. I think the real underpinning right now is first Saudi Arabia and Russia, they've come through and cut production. They continue to at least do that for at least another month or two from this sort of secondary cut.Data at the end of last week also showed that Russia did cut another 50,000 barrels per day. And that got them in line with where they're supposed to be producing. There was a lot of fear that Russia was going to be overproducing. And although China's weakness is front and center, the Chinese Yuan weakening because of that, it's really weighing on the metals complex.It's weighing on energy too, but the thing is China continues to import crude at near-record levels. So they're-- despite the weakness, despite the slowing growth, they are there right now. I think the fear would be if we continue to see weaker and weaker growth, that would taper off. However, I'm on the other side of that trade and I think that China picks up a bit and this is some of the worst news being priced in.Story continues- Yeah. I mean, Bill, having said that, what do you make of the reaction to some of the news that we've gotten from China on the economic front? I mean, it was just last week, we heard from the IEA saying that China's demand has surprised to the upside, and yet there seems to be this constant concern that kind of percolates into the oil markets, about how strong that recovery looks like.BILL BARUCH: Yeah. I mean, that's why we had oil markets at near multi-month highs and setting near multi-month highs. 83 bucks was really an upside target for us, that now we're going to see the market consolidate a bit. And I think tonight's deluge of economic data is going to be crucial.We have fixed asset investment. What we need to see, though, is really some stimulus to help get them off the ground. And I think we could be close to hearing something. Obviously the hanging property fears, country garden, the news, again, from them was weighing on sentiment coming into the US hours.So there's a lot of things here that are boiling. But at the end of the day, the best and most simple way to look at it-- at what all this means is the Chinese Yuan and the CME group has a Chinese Yuan contract. It's the USD/CNH. So it shows the-- as it rises, it's melting higher right now. It means the dollar is strengthening against the Chinese Yuan or the renminbi.And it's back at levels-- going back into the early or late part of 2022, was it? Yeah. And that was-- that's basically them exporting deflation. If they're exporting deflation-- I mean, ultimately their currency purchases less commodities.And crude's been able to muscle through things because the US growth has remained steady. And the demand from China remains steady. But the metals complex has been pretty ugly because of it.- Bill, what's your outlook for US production? We just had Rick talking about that just a moment ago. We have certainly seen a recovery. Obviously, oil producers want to capitalize on the rise that we have seen in crude prices. But what do you think that future growth-- how much growth could we see within that?BILL BARUCH: Yeah. I think right now, we're starting to see the production pick back up. You got to think about it from the producer standpoint that multiple times in the last couple of decades, as we see production pick up-- you know, the prices go higher, production comes back online and it races back online.I think right now is a unique position where you have Saudi Arabia pulling back production. You have Russia in the situation that they're in and actually following through with some cuts, although there's more probably in the supply.But you know, right now, I think the fact that it is unique position where prices have come off, they've consolidated very well and I mean, maybe these energy companies could really, really hedge pretty well. But they're able to produce here at these levels and really not disrupt the price because of what OPEC's done and trying to be a bit under the price ultimately.So I think here you're getting-- the Permian has been producing quite a bit more, if you go through some of these earnings reports from these companies like Chevron is producing the Permian at their highest level. So I like to look at it as some opportunity for these companies and investing companies that have low-cost Permian assets or good margins in the Permian.Because that's where the production is going to come from. But also at the end of the day, the entire space has seen tremendous underinvestment. And that's what's going to be the longest driver-- steadfast driver in higher prices.Because there hasn't been much investment and your prior segment you're talking about, and the Biden administration not really being able to talk about the production coming back online because it's sort of against a lot of the narratives they've discussed.But really, the production because of those narratives is we've seen the underinvestment and that's what's going to underpin prices. And if we get steady flows from the Permian and other places here from these companies, I think it's not going to disrupt price. That's where I really like a lot of these energy stocks right now.- Bill, you know, that raises the concern what this all means for these energy companies, particularly big oil names for their trajectory moving forward. I mean, we're talking about where oil prices are. But as you said that the long-term trend is underinvestment.You know, ExxonMobil themselves have talked about sort of low carbon being a big driver in the future. I mean, how do you look at that side of the investment? It feels like that was more front and center last year in terms of conversation, but those investments are continuing in the back.BILL BARUCH: Well, last year was a reality shock. When Russia invaded Ukraine, it really was a reality shock that energy runs the world. It really does. If you look at every product from lip gloss to keychains, just different things that you see around. The plastics-- I mean, shoes, bottom-- you know, soles of your shoes, everything is coming from petroleum.So-- and I think that it became a big reminder in how important petroleum-- is not only in producing the products, but heating your home, going from place to place and fuel. I think that was a reality check. And the fact that how quickly those costs drove higher, everybody realized it's an inflation problem if there's this much underinvestment and the world is not ready to move away from it.So I think, again, that was a reality check where we came into this year or came from last year coming into this year. And now, you're starting to see production come back online. There's incentives for some production come back online. But again, coming back to a lot of these companies, if you look at a lot of these-- if you sift through the earnings reports, one of the themes was the revenues down.But these companies were beating earnings, though the revenues down because of the price of oil. Now if the price of oil goes higher, I mean, these companies-- the margins are going to increase. The free cash flow is there. It's going to increase. I think these companies have put themselves in a tremendous spot. And they're not just flooding the market with oil. They're bringing it back.And then that really brings me to the resource life of these assets that they're drilling. I mean, the resource life has basically been halved. You go back the last 10-15 years. So they're getting less oil. Ultimately, there's going to be less lifetime in these and they're going to have to find other ways to get it. So it just keeps the-- it's going to keep the entire landscape very tight for I think, for the foreseeable future.All right, Bill Baruch. We have to leave it there. President of Blue Line Futures. Thanks so much.]"

Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman breaks down what this could mean for President Biden's economic plans as U.S. oil production nears record highs while the Biden administration attempts to keep promises on energy consumption and clean energy adoption.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]AKIKO FUJITA: Crude oil prices have steadied today after rising for seven straight weeks, pushing gas prices higher. Much of that's been dictated by global demand, but those higher prices are putting pressure on the Biden administration at a time when inflation is starting to cool down. Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman has more. And Rick, there are questions about how this could all play out if things reaccelerate in inflation.RICK NEWMAN: I think the Biden administration has to get very nervous when they see gas prices approaching $4 a gallon. And I think gasoline prices punch above their weight in terms of consumer psyches. And I think it actually makes a lot of difference what that first number is on the price. If it's a 3, it's probably OK, even if it's in the high 3's, as it is now, around 385. If it's a 4, I think it's very bad, even if it's 401. And of course, it got all the way up to a little bit over $5 on average last summer.So the problem with Biden is that he's really struggling in terms of voters' attitudes toward his handling of the economy, and that probably is largely because of inflation. And among inflation, gasoline is the price that consumers-- it's more visible to consumers than anything else. So I think Biden has to be worried about this.There's a really interesting irony here, Akiko, which is that the Energy Information Administration, the EIA, said recently, they think US domestic crude oil production is going to hit a new record high by the end of this year or by sometime next year. And we are already at record levels of natural gas production. So the two biggest fossil fuels, oil and natural gas, the US is either at record high levels of production or perhaps about to get there.And the problem for Biden is, he can't really just come out and say this. He can't come out and brag and say, hey, we've had more drilling under me than even under President Trump. Because, of course, he's trying to appeal to environmentalists and he's pushing hard for the green energy shift, and he's got this huge jack or the one anniversary of this huge bill from last year that established all these green energy subsidies. So Biden has gotten the additional domestic oil that he was hoping for around this time last year. I just don't think he's going to get any credit for it.AKIKO FUJITA: It's a tricky message he's had to navigate, we should say, over the course of his presidency, trying to really-- seeing the both sides or at least seeing the positives on both ends, depending on which side you're trying to appeal to. Rick Newman, as always, thanks so much for that.]"

Sixty-one percent of Gen Z has felt pressure on them since childhood to eat a certain way to communicate their identity and beliefs, which has created negativity and anxiety among this food-obsessed generation.Ketchum Food Gen Z Report InfographicThe wide-ranging research study from global communications consultancy Ketchum expands upon its legacy of food insights, intelligence and landmark research by examining the attitudes and beliefs of Gen Z about food. It builds upon Ketchum's Food 2020 research which defined approximately one-quarter of the population as Food eVangelists, influential consumers seeking to change the food system. Ketchum's newest food research reveals that approximately half of Gen Zers are classified as Food eVangelists, which is significantly higher than the general population, signaling increased engagement with food systems. Three key themes that offer new perspectives on Gen Z's relationship with food have also emerged.A stressed-out generation feels the pressureMore than all other generations, 63% of Gen Zers feel too much pressure to change the world and are more likely to believe their food choices need to signal their health, values and political beliefs. This has contributed to 62% of Gen Z who think their eating pattern is wrong. These unrealistic pressures have also created a ""say-eat gap"" between Gen Z's beliefs and behaviors. An overwhelming majority of Gen Z says that sustainability, animal welfare and LGBTQ rights are important factors when buying food, but they are not significant purchase drivers. Other priorities like taste, value and affordability trump issues that are important to them.""Since early childhood, this generation has seen food politicized and been taught to choose food products related to values,"" said Melissa Kinch, president, Ketchum's Food Consultancy. ""They are exhausted and acting very differently from previous generations. It has left them feeling insecure and negative about cooking and food. In particular, the contrast between what they say is important and how they spend their money is eye-opening.""Story continuesSocial media is a source of inspiration and anxietyThese digital natives are food obsessed and enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, cooking new dishes and exploring new cuisines. Gen Z scrolls TikTok, YouTube and Instagram and follows social media influencers for recipe ideas and inspiration. However, 67% worry they spend too much time on social media, and 58% believe that social media has a negative impact on their body image. They are also more likely than other generations to say that food makes them feel guilty, anxious, uncomfortable and overwhelmed. But Gen Zers remain optimistic, and most want food to make them happy, relaxed, healthy and confident.Forging their food futureDespite the pressures on them, Gen Zers are doing things their way. Sixty-eight percent cook differently from their parents, and most eat differently, too. Fifty-five percent of Gen Zers piece together snacks into a meal weekly, validating the popularity of the #girldinner. However, in survey results that challenge the naming of this TikTok trend, Gen Z men and women are ""snackifying"" meals equally.""If food companies and brands want to connect with Gen Z successfully, they should consider the impact of virtue signaling and tap into Gen Z's quest for stability to show ways their products can bring joy,"" said Kinch. ""Scrolling through TikTok validates the innovation and creativity Gen Z brings to the category, and food companies who collaborate with them will increase brand love and build loyalty.""To learn more about Ketchum's findings on Gen Z's relationship with food and to download a copy of the report with the full results, visit https://www.ketchum.com/gen-z-food-report/download-report-thank-you/.MethodologyTo identify what sets Gen Z's food habits apart from the generations before them, Ketchum Analytics conducted a 15-minute survey among 2,000 nationally representative U.S. children and adults ages 13+.

(NYSE: FE), is upgrading its electrical distribution system in Westmoreland County to help prevent lengthy service interruptions, particularly during severe weather. The work includes replacing utility poles and installing animal guards, fuses and other protective devices on power lines.West Penn Power Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""Our crews are working on three projects designed to help reduce both the number and duration of power outages for a combined 4,800 customers,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""This work is part of more than $100 million invested since 2016 to accelerate improvements to the local electric system that powers homes and businesses across West Penn Power's service area.""The upgrades are part of West Penn Power's Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan II, a $147 million initiative to accelerate capital investments to the company's electric distribution system over five years to help ensure continued electric service reliability for customers.West Penn Power line crews are working at 70 locations along a 31-mile power line that serves nearly 1,800 customers in North Huntingdon Township in the areas of Guffey, Robbins Station Road and Clay Pike. Crews will replace 18 wooden utility poles – raising the height of many by 5 feet to improve clearances and provide space to accommodate broadband cable or other future attachments – and 47 crossarms. Additionally, crews will install new wildlife guards to help prevent squirrels and other climbing animals from contacting transformers and disrupting electric service.The project also includes installing 55 new fuses on the line. Fuses are protective devices that open automatically when they detect a system irregularity, such as a tree branch contacting the wire. Fuses safeguard electrical equipment from damage while limiting the scope of outages to smaller sections of a power line. This results in fewer customers impacted by outages caused by trees, vehicle accidents or equipment issues. The work is expected to be completed by the end of summer.Story continuesFurther north in the county, West Penn Power crews are installing 53 new lightning-protection devices and 47 fuses on a distribution line that serves more than 1,300 customers in Murrysville. The 30-mile circuit provides electricity to numerous housing plans in the North Hills Road area, including Foxwood Estates, Windbrook Estates, Ramsgate, Friesell and Murrysville Manor near the Old William Penn Highway. This project is slated for completion by late August.The third project targets the replacement of 19 poles that have stood for decades along a 65-mile line in Salem Township. The power line serves about 1,700 customers in the areas of Congruity Road, Old Route 22, Route 819 and the Williamsburg and Monticello housing plans. Many of the new poles will stand 5 feet taller than the ones they replace to provide more clearance. The job is scheduled for completion later this summer.

But cost cuts, news that it was boosting its share buybacks and dismantling its mergers and acquisition committee, plus stronger-than-expected fourth quarter growth went a long way to quiet the activists, sources familiar with the matter said.The company also added Mason Morfit, the co-chief executive officer of investment firm ValueAct, to its board during the first quarter. ValueAct's ownership stake remained unchanged at 3.5 million at the end of the second quarter, its filing shows.However, a handful of other investors, including ones that might not have been pushing for change, cut their holdings between April and the end of June.Sachem Head Capital Management cut its stake by 20% after Salesforce made up nearly 5% of its portfolio. Farallon Capital Management sold 44% of its stake in Salesforce during the second quarter, while Polen Capital cut its holding by 24% and Light Street Capital reduced its ownership stake by 15%.Story continuesSalesforce's stock price has surged 57% since January and the bulk of the move occurred during the first quarter when the activists were pushing for changes and the company delivered.During the second quarter the stock price moved to $211 a share from $199 a share.

Yahoo Finance Tech Reporter Allie Garfinkle joins the Live show to break down the relationship between tech companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM), and ServiceNow (NOW), and the Fed's interest rate cycle and inflation goals.More Yahoo Finance inflation coverage:Stocks climb as inflation ticks up but trends stay positive: Stock market news todayInflation: Consumer prices rise 3.2% in July as inflation slowdown stallsInflation: Grocery prices are back up (slightly), beef prices jumpHousing costs are a big driver of inflation — for nowJuly inflation report: New and used car prices keep fallingJuly CPI report: Monthly inflation falls in line with estimates, rises by 0.2%Inflation moderating, Disney earnings, Alibaba revenue: 3 ThingsVideo TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: July CPI print showed inflation continuing to cool. Now, this should be great news for consumers and for tech companies. Here to tell us why is Yahoo Finance's senior tech reporter Allie Garfinkle. Hey, Allie.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Hi, Rachelle. I know there are a lot of tech investors out there who are holding Amazon, Microsoft, Google. And they're saying what does cooling inflation actually mean for my portfolio? And I come bearing some good news. I'm going to walk you through a couple of three-- a couple of key points here. I'd say about three. The first is that the relationship between tech and inflation is all about interest rates. Yes, I know everything is all about interest rates. But that is particularly true of tech. Think about it, Economics 101, right? High inflation suggests the need to raise interest rates to bring down that inflation.Now, high interest rates are, of course, are the kiss of death for capital intensive tech. Think of it this way. Your eggs cost less but your tech valuations ultimately are higher. Lower inflation, lower interest rates, higher tech valuation. Now, the other thing, though, is there's a bit of a catch here. I'd call it even a catch-22 between inflation and interest rates here. See, inflation is cooling more or less. But from-- and that is from its peaks. But interest rates aren't. Interest rates are at their 22-year high, I believe. So if this inflation does still prove to be as sticky, interest rates are going to stay where they are.Story continuesRemember, interest rates right now at 5.25% to 5.5%. Justifying a tech valuation and that kind of interest rate is going to be really tricky. So the last thing to consider, and you're probably wondering this, is if inflation is in fact cooling, what tickers are going to be the ones to watch? Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin and I were discussing this recently. And he thinks the answer is software. They could really benefit from a lot of lower pricing. Think Microsoft, Adobe, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. So those are the sectors that, again, if you believe inflation is cooling for good, at least for the time being, those are sort of the tickers to keep an eye on.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And so if given what we saw with CPI and PPI, to those in tech, I mean, is the inflation picture clear right now? And what are they planning for?ALLIE GARFINKLE: I've been alluding to this a little bit, Rachelle. The answer in short is not really. The picture, I would say, is mixed. On one hand, there is absolutely a lot of optimism that rates are going to get cut. There's a lot of optimism that inflation is cooling. However, in July, we did see inflation tick up again slightly, some higher-than-expected price increases, that granted, are muted compared to the highs of 2022. So either way, what I'd say, Rachelle, is look for sensitivity. You're going to see tech stocks move in response to what happens with both inflation and interest rates. Remember, of roughly 50 basis point move in interest rates could have a 10% impact on stocks. And that is going to be especially true for tech for the rest of this year.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We'll certainly be keeping track of all of that. Always appreciate you. Our very own Allie Garfinkle there. Thanks so much.]"

Flex Alerts are typically issued a day prior to an event. You can sign up for text notifications at www.FlexAlert.org.PG&amp;E Offers AC Energy Saving TipsAir conditioning use accounts for more than 40% of summer energy usage. Taking these simple steps can help reduce energy use during peak demand times and lower energy costs:Set the AC thermostat to 78 degrees or higher between the hours of 4-9 pm, health permitting. •  Cool your home to below-normal levels in the morning. Close windows, doors and window coverings and use fans to help keep your home cool while your AC unit takes a break.Replace air filters, and make sure air vents and registers are not blocked by furniture, curtains or rugs.•  Dirty air filters make the air conditioner work harder to circulate the air. Cleaning or replacing air filters monthly can improve energy efficiency and reduce costs.Weatherproof your home to limit the flow of warm outside air into the home, keep the cool air inside.•  Apply weatherstripping to doors, caulk around windows and doors, and install a door sweep on the garage door(s).Story continuesEnergy Incentive Programs for PG&amp;E CustomersPG&amp;E offers a variety of energy incentive programs to help customers reduce strain on the electric grid during high-demand periods, lower energy costs, and support the state's clean energy goals.The SmartAC™ Smart Thermostat and Power Saver Rewards programs help residential customers lower overall energy costs by shifting portions of energy use to hours when overall grid demand is lower and renewable energy resources are more plentiful. These free, voluntary energy incentive initiatives reward participants who can be flexible when they use energy.SmartAC Smart Thermostat—Customers can enroll in Smart Thermostat under the SmartAC program. On extreme heat days between June 1-Oct. 31 when PG&amp;E anticipates there will be a high demand for energy, the Smart Thermostat program will automatically shift a portion of participants' energy use out of the hours when most people are using their AC to keep homes comfortable without contributing to stress on the grid. Enrolled customers may opt out of any event simply by changing the setpoint on their thermostat.Participants who enroll with an existing smart thermostat receive $75 when they sign up, or enrollees can receive $120 off a new smart thermostat. All participants are eligible to receive $25 at the end of the SmartAC season.Power Saver Rewards—By conserving energy during Power Saver Rewards events coinciding with a CAISO Flex Alert and/or an Energy Emergency Alert Watch between May 1-Oct. 31, customers earn $2 for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy saved. Customers who reduce energy use between 4-9 p.m. on event days receive an automatic credit on their energy statement after the program season ends. Notifications to customers to reduce energy use as part of the program are sent out the day before an event. There is no penalty for not reducing energy.Last year, PG&amp;E customers received over $55 million in bill credits. Over the 10 event days in 2022, the average customer bill credit for program participants was $35.Resources to Help Customers Manage Summer Energy BillsPG&amp;E customers can benefit by participating in a variety of programs to prepare for higher summer energy costs:Personalized Rate Comparison supports customers by providing the best rate plan options for their household, which can help save money on energy bills.Budget Billing averages out energy costs for more predictable monthly payments and helps customers avoid seasonal bill peaks.Bill Forecast Alerts are notifications sent by email, text or phone notifying the customer if their monthly bill is expected to exceed a specific amount set by the customer, based on how they are using energy.Home Energy Checkup helps customers assess their energy use and gives customized savings tips.HomeIntel is a free energy saving program that includes a Smart Audit and a personal energy coach. Customers who have lived in their home for more than a year and have a smart meter installed are eligible to participate.Eligible customers are encouraged to take advantage of income-qualified assistance programs including:California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program offers a discount of 20% or more each month on energy bills.Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) Program offers a monthly discount of 18% on electricity bills for households with three or more people.Medical Baseline provides a lower monthly rate for customers with special energy needs due to certain medical conditions.For more information on ways to improve energy efficiency, visit pge.com/summer.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

49,c841faa8-74e6-304f-812e-b92d622bb6e9,NWS,2023-08-15,News (NASDAQ:NWSA) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.10,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/news-nasdaq-nwsa-due-pay-100236569.html,1692093756.0,STORY,['NWSA'],"[News Corporation's (NASDAQ:NWSA) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.10 per share on 11th of October. This means the annual payment will be 0.9% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average. See our latest analysis for News News' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. The last payment made up 77% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 16% which is fairly sustainable.historic-dividendNews Is Still Building Its Track RecordNews' dividend has been pretty stable for a little while now, but we will continue to be cautious until it has been demonstrated for a few more years. The payments haven't really changed that much since 8 years ago. We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.Dividend Growth Could Be ConstrainedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that News has been growing its earnings per share at 58% a year over the past five years. Fast growing earnings are great, but this can rarely be sustained without some reinvestment into the business, which News hasn't been doing.Our Thoughts On News' DividendOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for News that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Is News not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Over the last month, the Healthcare Select Sector ETF XLV has been the second strongest sector in the market, behind just the energy market.By scanning Zacks proprietary research I have identified three stocks I think will outperform over the near-term and possibly the long-term.  Along with the industry strength, Align Technologies ALGN, Eli Lilly LLY, and Cardinal Health CAH boast top Zacks Ranks, and various bullish catalysts.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHealthcare Sector Forming a Bull FlagAfter moving sideways for the better part of two years, XLV has carved out a compelling long-term technical chart pattern. If XLV can breakout above the upper bound, it should signal the next major bull run in the healthcare industry and various stock components.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewAlign TechnologyAlign Technology is a leading medical technology company that specializes in the design, manufacture, and marketing of clear aligner orthodontic devices. The company's flagship product, Invisalign, has revolutionized orthodontic treatment by offering an alternative to traditional braces.Invisalign's clear and removable aligners have gained popularity among patients seeking a more discreet and comfortable teeth-straightening solution. Align Technologies also provides digital treatment planning software and intraoral scanning systems to support dental professionals in delivering effective and personalized orthodontic care.Align Technology enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 5.6% over the last two months and are projected to grow 65% YoY to $2.25 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been upgraded by 5.3% and are expected to climb 12.8% YoY to $8.75 per share.Story continuesOver the next 3-5 years EPS are expected to grow by an enviable 17.5% annually.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchALGN has also been forming a convincing technical chart pattern traders may want to keep an eye on. Just today, ALGN stock broke out from a bull flag which had been building over the last two weeks. So long as the price doesn’t trade back below the breakout level, Align Technology stock should continue higher.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewBecause of its impressive earnings growth, Align Technology trades at a premium valuation, and has for many years. Today, it is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 49.2x, which is well above the industry average of 20.7x, but still below its five-year median of 51x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEli LillyEli Lilly, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies has been on a tear this year, up 48% YTD, and for good reason. The drugmaker has been riding a wave of bullishness, as investors recognize multiple major drug development achievements. Eli Lilly has recently formed its own weight-loss drug, Mounjaro, to compete against the current, very hyped options Ozempic, and Wegovy. LLY’s drug is expected to have considerably fewer side-effects and be just as valuable.Additionally, LLY drug developers have achieved breakthrough success in creating a new medication to treat Alzheimer’s. Late-stage trials for Eli Lilly’s Donanemab, showed a significant slowdown in memory loss and cognitive decline in older adults.With treatments for two of the worst public health issues in the pipeline, analysts have significantly boosted earnings estimates for LLY, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 20.1% and are forecast to grow 42% YoY to $2.81 per share.Additionally, sales over the next two years are projected to grow in the high teens, and EPS are expected to climb 25% annually over the next 3-5 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBecause of the incredible anticipation surrounding Eli Lilly, its valuation has rocketed higher over the last years. However, considering the incredible pace of growth expected in earnings, LLY shouldn’t have too much trouble growing into the premium valuation.LLY is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 53.6x, which is above the industry average and its five-year median of 24x. It is also worth noting that LLY stock pays a dividend yield of 0.9% and has raised it by an average of 15% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCardinal HealthCardinal Health is a global healthcare services company that plays a vital role in the pharmaceutical supply chain. It is the second largest pharmaceutical distributor in the US and manufactures products such as single-use surgical drapes, gowns, and apparel among many others.Cardinal Health stock has been forming one of the most powerful technical trade setups I have seen all year. Over the last six weeks, CAH has been building out an increasingly tight bull flag consolidation.If the price can breakout above the $93.40 level, it should make a major move higher. Alternatively, if CAH loses the $92 level, the setup is invalidated, and investors can look for other opportunities.  TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewCardinal Health has also begun to see some slight upward earnings revisions, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. While current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by just 0.7%, they are expected to grow a whopping 41% YoY to $1.48 per share. Additionally, FY23 earnings are forecast to grow 13.2%, and FY24 to grow 14.2% YoY.Sales are also projected to increase 12.5% annually to $203 billion, and EPS are expected to grow 13.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCAH is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 14.1x, which is below the industry average of 20.7x, and just above its 10-year median of 13.1x. Cardinal Health also has a dividend yield of 2.2% and has increased the dividend payment by an average of 1% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineI think that the healthcare industry offers some of the best opportunities in the market today, and the move higher could just be getting started.

Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down what Netflix's first steps into cloud gaming could mean for the future of the streamer and whether has the potential to stack up against mainstream gaming companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SONY).Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]AKIKO FUJITA: Netflix is launching a test of its video game streaming services in Canada and the UK starting today. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley has the details. Dan, this is still a very limited release, but certainly marks a big step in terms of the company's ambitions in gaming.DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Akiko. This is still a beta. It's as you said limited. Only certain users in the UK and Canada are going to be able to access it. But what they're going to be offering are two different games. One is called ""Oxenfree,"" and the other is ""Molehew's Mining Adventure.""Now, these aren't the most aggressively graphics-intensive games on the market. But what it does show is that Netflix is moving forward with their gaming ambitions. They already offer mobile games on mobile platforms. If you load up Netflix on your smartphone, chances are you'll see some of the games that they offer there alongside the movies and shows that are already on there.But this is a different kind of animal. This is where you would actually be streaming the game from Netflix servers to your device. The benefit of cloud gaming is that you don't need a powerful system to run video games. You don't need a high-end PC. You don't need a pricey console. You can do it on your TV, your smartphone, your tablet, a Chromebook, an older laptop or desktop, things along those lines. And you can still get high end graphics and everything that goes along with that through cloud streaming.We see other companies in the space, but Microsoft-- sorry-- Netflix being here really is the one that we were waiting for. Everyone that has a kind of cloud gaming service, whether that's Microsoft or Sony, I generally refer to it as kind of Netflix style gaming, and now we actually have the Netflix of gaming.Story continuesWe still have to wait, though, to see whether or not they're going to roll out high-end games-- AAA games is what they're called. The ""Call of Dutys,"" things along those lines. But this is a seemingly good start for them.SEANA SMITH: Dan, how much disruption do you think Netflix is going to bring to this space? And you mentioned some of the players that have already been in gaming right now. Are they going to be able to compete with Netflix now one of the big entrants within the industry?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I mean, look, Microsoft is the leader bar none at this point. They have their Xbox Cloud Gaming. It's part of their Xbox Game Pass service. You have to get the highest level that they offer. But Sony also has its own cloud gaming offering as well. The difference between Microsoft and Sony is that Microsoft is first party Microsoft games, games that they develop or are developed by studios that they own. They put out the same day that they hit retail on their cloud gaming service. So that's a benefit for Microsoft to really say, look, we are the preeminent cloud gaming platform available.Sony is not doing that, but they are starting to work on getting PlayStation 5 games on their cloud service. There's also Nvidia and Amazon, by the way. They also have their own cloud gaming services, but it's not easy. Google had tried to run its own cloud gaming service called Stadia and folded that entirely. Now it's potentially looking at putting some kind of cloud gaming in YouTube according to the ""Wall Street Journal"", but it's not something that is necessarily easy even for companies with seemingly limitless coffers like Alphabet.So Netflix is going to really need to prove that this technology works. And even when it comes to Microsoft and what they have to offer, if there's any kind of slowdown in your internet connection, if you don't have a fast enough internet connection, or there's a lot of usage in your area and you start to run into lag, then it throws off the entire experience.It's not like where you can sit there, pause it, and let it buffer like you could do with a show or movie, this is a game that you're actively playing. And if you press a button and it doesn't respond properly you know, that instant on screen, then it's a wasted experience. So we have to see how Netflix manages to do that and what the experience is like to see if eventually they'll be able to do what Microsoft can do.And I think one of the important things to point out just real quick is, Microsoft you can use your Xbox controller. You can also do that with the Mac or PC, you can plug-in your Xbox controller. Same thing with Sony, you can do it on your Mac or PC with your PlayStation controller.Netflix isn't offering a controller. They're letting you use your smartphone. So I don't-- it's going to be tough if they end up going into more hardcore gaming, more AAA games to be able to do that with a smartphone controller, so we'll just have to see if eventually they provide support for peripherals like an Xbox controller or a PlayStation controller down the line. But, as I said, this is a big step for them. And if it does end up working out, we could see a whole new revenue stream for them down the line.AKIKO FUJITA: Dan, I have a feeling some of those challenges you talked about with gaming drawn from personal experience, right?DAN HOWLEY: Just a little. Just a little.[LAUGHTER]AKIKO FUJITA: Just a little. Just a little. Points to a lot of frustrations there as well, though. Dan Howley, thanks so much as always.]"

If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc.

62,25eefd7e-706a-366e-9b7d-68eba7a21a0f,WBA,2023-08-15,Could Rite Aid Become the Next AMC Meme Stock?,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-rite-aid-become-next-203918038.html,1691527158.0,STORY,"['RAD', 'AMC', 'WBA']","[Last week, meme investors “discovered” Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), sending its shares up 70%. The Wall Street Journal would quickly give the company a meme stock crown.For most traditional investors, Rite Aid looks like a terrible bet. The struggling drug retailer hasn’t been profitable since 2017, and a deal five years ago to sell 1,932 stores to Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) left the chain with some of its less profitable stores. Rite Aid generates only $10 million per store in annual revenues, a third lower than Walgreens.But try telling that to a meme investor. To them, Rite Aid looks like a highly shorted equity that could rise 5X… or even 10X in a matter of months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlready, speculators are snapping up out-of-the-money options — high-risk bets that occasionally pay off handsomely. And as interest in RAD stock mounts, don’t be surprised if this failing retailer suddenly becomes the next meme.Rite Aid: What Makes a Meme Stock?Meme stocks are loosely defined as speculative stocks that have gained viral popularity on social media.Some of these firms are compelling bets with solid cash flows. Fast food chain Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) briefly became a meme stock in 2021; the firm continues to generate plenty of growth today. Other bets are less healthy. Millions of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (OTCMKTS:BBBYQ) shares continued to change hands, even after the bankrupt retailer dropped into the over-the-counter (OTC) markets.But meme stocks all share a popularity that goes beyond ordinary money-making endeavors. To investors in these popular stocks, buying shares is often the price of admission into a community of like-minded investors.That means most meme stocks are widely recognizable companies. Retailers like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) have extensive physical footprints. Visit any major U.S. city, and chances are good you’ll drive past one of their stores. And virtually all meme stocks follow easy-to-understand investment themes, such as electric vehicles, bankruptcies, and deep value.Story continuesThat makes Rite Aid a particularly irresistible target for meme stardom. The 60-year-old firm has roughly 2,213 stores scattered across the U.S. and a seemingly straightforward business model that’s mostly easy to grasp. Its balance sheet also provides incredible upside if things go right.Rite Aid’s Hidden UpsideOn a practical level, Rite Aid’s shares have unusually large upside. All else equal, every 1% increase in Rite Aid’s enterprise value mathematically raises its market capitalization by 21.8%. That makes both its stock and options a potentially explosive play.Four other sources of leverage further boost potential returns.First, the firm has large financial debts. According to data from Thomson Reuters, Rite Aid’s $224 million on debt service payments in fiscal 2023 pegs its cost of long-term debt at 16%. That’s far higher than its estimated 7.4% cost of equity and means every dollar the company can put toward debt extinguishment will tremendously impact profitability.Second, Rite Aid also carries a lot of physical debt. Since 2016, the firm has spent only $1.2 billion on the purchase of fixed assets — money used on renovating stores, warehouses and other tangible assets. That’s about $700 million shy of its depreciation charges in that period, and why most Rite Aid stores look far older than their peers.Third, the drug retailer has potential legal debt. In March, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the company for allegedly filling illegal opioid prescriptions. According to the lawsuit, Rite Aid “knowingly filled unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances” between May 2014 through June 2019. A similar case against Walmart’s (NYSE:WMT) pharmacies in 2022 resulted in a $3.1 billion fine.Finally, Rite Aid has a great deal of supplier debt. In July, the company reported it had $1.5 billion in accounts payable — more than its gross profits during an average quarter. That magnifies Rite Aid’s return on capital invested (ROIC) and creates another form of financial leverage.That gives the drug retailer an enormous amount of hidden leverage. Although the likeliest outcome is eventual bankruptcy, even minor improvements in the company’s fortunes can have a knock-on effect on its worth.Rite Aid: Becoming a Meme StockThis fact isn’t lost on meme investors. On Monday, the open interest of short-dated $4 options doubled as investors began wagering that shares would continue going up. These are some of the riskiest bets that ordinary traders can make, since most short-dated options expire worthless.Volumes traded have also risen to absurd levels. Last Wednesday, 57.2 million Rite Aid shares changed hands, up from 778,000 the week before. The company only has 56.7 million shares outstanding.Other meme stocks have also begun to pick up steam. The Roundhill MEME ETF (NYSEARCA:MEME), a broad-based meme stock ETF, is up 8% in the past month. Ordinarily, rising meme stocks create a “wealth effect” among investors, causing even greater risk-taking.That suggests RAD stock could rise higher on a broad meme rally. Its 23% short interest — and high leverage — makes it a candidate for a squeeze.That’s excellent news for Rite Aid shareholders. A share spike would help the firm refinance and reduce its costly debts. Rite Aid can issue another 18.3 million shares without increasing its authorized share cap. A cash influx could also help fund more extensive renovations, making its physical stores more competitive with profitable dollar stores. Many of Rite Aid’s ills are curable with cash.Where Will RAD Stock Go?Of course, an investment in Rite Aid stock comes with plenty of risks.The most obvious is that shares go to zero. The firm remains solidly unprofitable, and analysts believe that operating losses will continue through at least 2026. A 3-stage DCF model shows that shares are worth zero.Corporate management also remains in a funk. An interim CEO has headed the firm since January, and finding a qualified replacement has proved difficult.Most importantly, investors face getting caught up in a meme frenzy that goes nowhere. Many speculators have bought shares of promising meme bets, only to see shares decline. Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) has lost 99.9% of its market value since 2021, despite being among the most popular meme stocks on the social media site StockTwits.Still, history tells us that turnarounds like Rite Aid tend to perform better than expected. And Rite Aid’s underlying business is far from dead; it still makes over 50% of its revenues from prescription drugs and another 25% from pharmacy services — areas with typically high margins. Foot traffic is also reaccelerating. In fiscal 2023, Rite Aid recorded a 6.9% increase in same-store sales growth.If meme investors do jump on the bandwagon, speculators could expect shares to surge well beyond $5. And for those seeking price action, RAD stock will likely prove too tempting to resist.As of this writing, Tom Yeung did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of Sysco (NYSE:SYY) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Sysco:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$3.0b ÷ (US$23b - US$8.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Therefore, Sysco has an ROCE of 21%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Sysco roceIn the above chart we have measured Sysco's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Sysco's ROCE Trend?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Sysco. The company has employed 24% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 21%. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 21%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If Sysco can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.What We Can Learn From Sysco's ROCESysco has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. However, over the last five years, the stock has only delivered a 7.0% return to shareholders who held over that period. So because of the trends we're seeing, we'd recommend looking further into this stock to see if it has the makings of a multi-bagger.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Sysco and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Archer-Daniels-Midland:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$4.1b ÷ (US$55b - US$19b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Archer-Daniels-Midland has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 11%.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROCE Trending?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Archer-Daniels-Midland. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 11%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 36% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Archer-Daniels-Midland thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Archer-Daniels-Midland has. Since the stock has returned a solid 91% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland  that we think you should be aware of.While Archer-Daniels-Midland may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.48 billion, suggesting growth of 18.8% from the year-ago period.Synopsys expects non-GAAP earnings between $2.70 and $2.75 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.73 per share indicates growth of 30% year over year.The software company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.6%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming announcement.Synopsys, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSynopsys, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderSynopsys’ third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for its solid product portfolio. The continuous shift to high-performance cloud computing due to the growing hybrid working environment is expected to have aided the demand for the company’s Intellectual Property (“IP”) solutions, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express 5.0 &amp; 6.0, 800G Ethernet and DDR5 memory.The growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, the Internet of Things, high-performance computing, the Cloud and automotive is anticipated to have boosted the demand for Synopsys’ advanced solutions in the third quarter. The company is likely to have gained from growth in Fusion Compiler, which is fueled by large deal wins in the 5G, AI and server chip markets.In the fiscal third quarter, the increasing global design activity and customer engagements are likely to have been Synopsys’ growth drivers. The strong adoption of interface and foundation IP solutions is likely to have boosted revenues for SNPS’ interface portfolio. Additionally, widespread contract wins and the increasing deployment of the Fusion Platform, including Fusion Compiler, might drive the company’s fiscal third-quarter results. Our estimate for the Design IP product segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $360.4 million.Story continuesSynopsys’ partnership with industry leaders like Microsoft and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is expected to have accelerated the deployment of its cloud solutions. This might have aided the company’s top line during the quarter under review.SNPS’ solid electronic design automation software partner base, which includes Advanced Micro Devices, Juniper Networks, Realtek, Toshiba and Wolfson, is likely to have served as a major revenue driver. Increased design investments in Synopsys’ ARC processors by automotive companies are also an upside. Further, the strong adoption of security solutions for interfaces, such as PCI Express, CXL and DDR, with more than 30 design wins across all market segments, is positive. Our estimates for the Electronic Design Automation and Software Integrity product categories are pegged at $953.1 million and $141.5 million.However, the heightened competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems might have played a spoilsport for Synopsys. The tightening corporate budget amid ongoing macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable currency exchange rates are likely to have partially offset the benefits of the aforementioned factors.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for SNPS this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Though Synopsys currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

HCA Healthcare issued a press release to report the incident publicly on July 10, 2023 and sent emails to the patients impacted by the incident the following week. HCA Healthcare is now mailing notification letters on a rolling basis, according to states of residence. This press release is intended to provide the same information included in the notification letters to individuals for whom HCA Healthcare has insufficient or out-of-date contact information.As previously reported, on or around July 5, 2023, HCA Healthcare discovered that a list of certain information with respect to some of its patients was made available on an online platform by an unauthorized party. The information was obtained by the unauthorized party in late June in what appears to be a theft from an external storage location exclusively used to automate the formatting of email messages, such as reminders that patients may wish to schedule an appointment and education on healthcare programs and services. This incident caused no disruption to the care and services HCA Healthcare affiliates provide to patients and communities.The exposed files contained patient name, city, state, zip code, email, telephone number, date of birth, gender, service date, location and, in some instances, the date of next appointment. The exposed personal information does not include clinical information, such as treatment, diagnosis, or condition; or payment information, such as credit card or account numbers; or other sensitive information, such as passwords, government-issued ID numbers, or social security numbers.HCA Healthcare disabled user access to the aforementioned storage location as an immediate containment measure. HCA Healthcare also reported this event to law enforcement, retained third-party forensic and threat intelligence advisors to investigate the incident, and secured complimentary credit and identity protection services for affected individuals.Story continuesHCA Healthcare cares deeply about the patients it serves and takes this incident very seriously.

HCA Healthcare will never request sensitive information by phone or email and encourages patients to remain vigilant in identifying calls, emails or SMS texts which appear to be spam or fraudulent. Additionally, HCA Healthcare is providing complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services to affected individuals for 2 years via IDX.

The company expects to pay more than $1.5 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2023.However, Air Products is exposed to headwinds from unfavorable currency translation. The company saw currency headwinds in its Asia segment in the last reported quarter due to the weakening of Asian currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, which reduced its sales and EBITDA for the unit by 5% in the quarter. It is likely to face continued currency headwinds in the fiscal fourth quarter.The slowdown in China and Europe may also affect the company’s business in these regions. The cooling China economy might impact volumes in the Industrial Gases - Asia segment.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down Goldman's call.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: As inflation continues to show signs of cooling, Goldman Sachs economists are penciling in the Fed's first interest rate cut in June of next year as it looks to normalize the funds rate. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has the details on this call. So talk about this base case here.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Rachelle. So what I'm standing next to right now is that base case call from Goldman. And you can see what they're saying here is essentially they think the first rate cut for the Fed is going to come in the second quarter of next year. So when you're looking at this graph here, you can see Goldman's call is in purple. What's in Orange, which is interesting to point out, is actually what the market's currently pricing.So the market is currently pricing a cut at around the same time as Goldman, but they see price cuts coming steeper and quicker than Goldman Sachs currently sees it. Goldman Sachs has viewed themselves as relatively hawkish in terms of Fed policy, which is why people have been very interested in this call out today.Now, I want to take a look at the different scenarios that Goldman Sachs has pointed out that could happen and how that could sort of drive interest rates. So they see four different scenarios that they highlight here. The baseline scenario is in blue. That is driven by inflation. And that's the key thing to understand here is the different things driving these scenarios.Then there is the red scenario. This would be driven by a full recession. But we've been talking a lot over the last couple of weeks, economists see less and less likelihood of a recession. In fact, Goldman Sachs sees about a 20% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. So they don't see this big drop in rate cuts coming quick and fast next year anymore.Story continuesThey also don't see growth completely going negative or going this-- the threat of growth going negative being abundant next year. That's your orange line. So what they see now is cuts coming next year but not coming at necessarily a rapid pace. They see the reason the Fed would be cutting is because inflation is starting to come into proper balance and headed toward the right direction.So then when you take a look at that inflation chart, you can see that starting to play out a little bit. We're still pretty far away from the 2% the Fed wants, which would be a little bit closer to down here. But core PCE, which the Fed closely follows, has been headed down in that direction. And essentially, what Goldman Sachs is arguing overall here is that will be the driver for what happens with rate cuts.Not a recession, not the economy fully slowing down, but rather just the Fed winning that battle against inflation and starting to feel very confident about the fact that it's in a good place. In the second quarter of next year come May or June, that will drive the first Fed rate cut that we see after this long rate hike cycle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We'll certainly have to see. I mean, as we saw with the regional banking crisis, anything could really throw a spanner in the works. But I know you'll be tracking all of that for us. Thanks so much, Josh.]"

However, this summer, Blankfein reportedly conveyed his discontent to Solomon over his successor’s actions.Blankfein spoke to Solomon in June—phoning him out of the blue and catching the current Goldman Sachs boss unawares—to complain about the company’s performance, sources told the New York Times.The retired CEO has apparently lost $50 million because of Goldman’s lackluster stock performance so far this year, sinking approximately 1.6% year to date.Stocks at the Wall Street giant have plummeted more than 8% in the past six months leaving investors—among them Blankfein, who owned approximately 2.4 million shares as of 2019—unimpressed.According to three people briefed on the conversation, Blankfein told Solomon he could provide more hands-on advice and even went as far as saying he would return to the company if it would help improve its fortunes. Solomon declined.Sources added that Blankfein’s message to Solomon was clear: His patience is running out.A spokesman at Goldman Sachs declined to comment when approached by Fortune.Representatives for Blankfein—reportedly worth $1.2 billion himself—did not immediately respond when approached by Fortune for comment.Compared with its Wall Street counterparts, Goldman’s past half year hasn’t been exceptionally bad—on the surface at least.At the time of writing, for the past six months Bank of America and Citigroup shares have both dropped—by approximately 12% and 13.6%, respectively.The difference is that Goldman has also undertaken three rounds of layoffs in less than 12 months—including 250 senior roles.But the gloomy news doesn’t stop there for Goldman’s institutional investors—which control more than 71% of the stock.The company estimated to be around 154 years old reported in July its revenue had sunk by 8% with return on equity sliding to 4%—the worst among the top U.S. banks.Story continuesOn a call with analysts, Solomon sought to strike an optimistic note, saying that although the mergers and capital-markets business had been depressed for a couple of quarters, the sector remained “fundamental” to the business.“I think this is a cycle,” Solomon reasoned. “We haven’t seen a cycle in a while, and the other side of the cycle will continue to look attractive.”Individual issuesSources told the New York Times that questions are also being asked of the CEO courtesy of the fact he moonlights as a DJ and last year reportedly used a corporate private jet to fly to one of his gigs.“Solomon does not have a personality which gains the loyalty and respect of his subordinates,” a source told the Times.A Goldman spokesman countered: “David is direct and focused on results. Our clients and investors are direct, and they expect results.”The boss has also received some hints he may have fallen out of favor with the higher-ups: Last year he saw his salary slashed by 29% to $25 million. The bank’s compensation committee said Solomon was demonstrating “strong individual performance and effective leadership” but cited a “challenging operating environment” for the pay cut.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

GPN is well poised to grow on the back of rising transaction volumes, strategic acquisitions and partnerships. However, increasing costs are likely to hurt margins.Global Payments — with a market cap of $33 billion — is a payment solutions provider based in Atlanta, GA. It provides innovative software and services all around the globe. The payments technology company has a massive network including North America, Latin America, Europe and the Asia Pacific.Courtesy of solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth holding on to at the moment.Where do the Estimates Stand?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Payments’ 2023 earnings is pegged at $10.39 per share, indicating an 11.5% year-over-year rise. The company beat earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed on the other occasions, with an average surprise of 1.1%.Global Payments Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGlobal Payments Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGlobal Payments Inc. price-eps-surprise | Global Payments Inc. QuoteFurthermore, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $8.7 billion for 2023, indicating a 7.2% year-over-year rise.2023 Performance ViewThe continuously increasing demand for digital payment methods is expected to support Global Payments’ transaction volume growth. Also, its EVO business acquisition is expected to boost revenues in the coming quarters. It expects adjusted net revenues to be between $8,660 million and $8,735 million in 2023, the midpoint of which implies an improvement of 7-8% from the 2022 reported figure.GPN estimates adjusted net revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions business to grow in the 15-16% range in 2023. Meanwhile, the Issuer Solutions segment’s adjusted net revenues are expected to grow 5-6% year over year.Improving operations are expected to boost its profits, which triggered the company to increase its bottom-line guidance. It now expects adjusted EPS to be between $10.35 and $10.44 this year, which suggests 11-12% growth from the 2022 figure. It predicts the adjusted operating margin to increase up to 120 bps year over year in 2023.Story continuesIncreasing sales figures and vertical market growth will likely aid its Merchant Solutions business in 2023. Core issuer growth and expanding commercial card transactions are expected to benefit its Issuer Solutions unit.GPN’s financial flexibility enables the company to focus on strategic investments and return capital to shareholders. It exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,919.6 million, way above the current portion of long-term debt of $75.7 million. In the first six months of 2023, GPN generated operating cash flows of $1,164.5 million.The company’s prudent acquisitions and top-tier strategic partnerships will not only grow its business but also future-proof its underlying technology. Alliances with major players like Alphabet and Amazon Web Services are expected to help in this regard. It also does not shy away from divesting non-core assets. It closed the consumer business divestment in the second quarter. A growing presence in the Asia Pacific market will position the company for long-term growth.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that can hinder the stock’s growth.Despite implementing multiple cost-control measures, the company's operating expenses are on the rise. We expect its operating costs to increase 5% year over year in 2023, primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses. This can dent the company's profit levels.Also, rising competition in the payment market is noteworthy. The emerging payment companies with significant growth potential are capturing markets at a significantly faster rate. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive GPN’s long-term growth.Better-Ranked PlayersSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services space are Paysafe Limited PSFE, FirstCash Holdings, Inc.

It catapulted her to fame and as she took on more roles, her eyes often wandered to the male lead when reviewing screenplays.“I remember saying, ‘Every time I pick up a script, I want to play the guy,’” Robbie told the Hollywood Reporter in 2020. “Wouldn’t it be so cool if people pick up scripts that we’re making and always wanted to play the female role?’”Sensing a gap in the market for female leads, she took matters into her own hands alongside friends Sophia Kerr, Josey McNamara, and now-husband Tom Ackerly: Together, they built a powerhouse movie production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, with the goal of making stories for and by women. ""There's only so much you can do as an actor,” Robbie once told Marie Claire, explaining that producers are the ones involved in hiring and pay.Guided by the motto, “If it’s not a f**k, yes, it’s a no,” LuckyChap has since grown into an empowering powerhouse. The company told the Wall Street Journal it only greenlights 1% of proposals, among them: I, Tonya, Promising Young Woman, and Birds of Prey, which collectively raked in over $275 million. Its latest production, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, was a historical money-maker that surpassed $1 billion in box office sales in the first two weeks alone.Despite such success, getting rich isn’t LuckyChap or Robbie’s overarching goal. “If we were money-oriented people, we’d probably be working in a different industry,” Robbie said in the Hollywood Reporter interview. Rather, they aim to provide a ""platform"" for young directors and women creatives.Changing HollywoodLuckyChap released its first movie in 2017: I, Tonya, about former figure skater Tonya Harding and her link to the attack on competitor Nancy Kerrigan, which turned into a smash hit grossing more than $58 million in box offices worldwide on a comparatively low budget of $11 million. It was an ambitious project; Robbie attributed part of the studios’ go-getter attitude as being “too young and dumb” to understand the undertaking at the time—but they were sold on the script. Robbie starred in the film herself, using her star power to get the group’s foot in the door. The long-term goal was to have a “very established production company with a varied body of work and hopefully critical acclaim” that “would be its own entity, not ‘Margot Robbie’s company,’” she told Vogue Australia in 2018.Story continuesEven with I, Tonya’s success, LuckyChaps didn’t want to rest on its laurels; the company told the Hollywood Reporter that they needed to prove they weren’t a one hit wonder. After hanging their ice skates up, the studio, which had cemented deals with Amazon for television and Warner Brothers for film, churned out films Birds of Prey and Promising Young Women and T.V. series like Maid and Dollface, all female-fronted projects. Robbie also used LuckyChaps to greenlight initiatives like a six week writing paid program for female writers.The hard work hasn’t come without a cost, though; Robbie admitted to Vogue that she’s missed out on life events: “Having a business is stressful and time-consuming, but it’s incredibly rewarding,” she said. Still though, she added, “work never feels like work to me” because her partners are her best friends—a closeness they use to their advantage to bring the business to its full potential.The group is selective about what they choose, but when they’re in, they’re in, with a characteristic boldness, fun nature, and persistence. LuckyChap “isn't pandering to Hollywood or anyone else,"" Emerald Fennell, director of Promising Young Woman, told the Journal. ""They stand behind you and don’t care if it gets them into trouble.""Sticking up for their creatives has helped distinguish the studio from the crowd and paved the way for an existential and boundary-pushing movie that somehow got a corporation’s stamp of approval: Barbie.Come on Barbie, let’s go BarbieWhispers of a Barbie movie began in 2009 as it bounced around various writer and producer groups. LuckyChaps grabbed the project out of production hell in 2016 when Robbie entered initial talks for the starring role. Robbie told Time she emphasized to Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz that her company wanted to respect the brand’s history while including criticism. She wanted to surprise moviegoers, aware that people assumed what the movie would look like with her as Barbie.With her eyes set on Gerwig as director, Robbie fully sold the project in a meeting with Mattel and Warner Brothers, describing the duo of Barbie and Gerwig as iconic as “dinosaurs and [Steven] Spielberg” (referring to Jurassic Park), estimating the movie could make $1 billion, per Collider.And so the project became the company’s “Everest,” as McNamara described it. Balancing the legacy of Mattel with a pointed script by Gerwig and her partner, fellow creative Noah Baumbach, proved to be a hard act, but one that Robbie was up to the challenge of. Barbie itself and its legacy came with a “laundry list of concerns,” Robbie told the New York Times. Still, LuckyChap gave the writers creative freedom; Vogue reported that no one saw the script until it was finished.From talking through lines for six hours and even acting out a scene for the president of Mattel, LuckyChap was successful in their negotiations to film how they wanted; they were able to convince studios to let them call Barbie “stereotypical Barbie'' and keep a scene that Gerwig calls the “heart of the movie."" They were awarded a $150 million marketing budget that made Barbie pervasive for months before it hit the theaters, no doubt contributing to its status as this summer’s blockbuster and a record-setting one at that (Gerwig is now the first solo-female director to helm a billion-dollar movie).As for what’s next for LuckyChap, Robbie isn’t jumping on a Barbie sequel. But there are murmurs that LuckyChap has several works in production—a Jennifer Aniston and Julia Roberts body swap movie, a film based off of Disney ride Big Thunder Mountain, an adaptation of best-selling novel “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” and more. Not just for being lucky, but smart too, Robbie and crew are plunging forward with the same combination of stubborn supportiveness and laidback fun to other women driven projects.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down what Netflix's first steps into cloud gaming could mean for the future of the streamer and whether has the potential to stack up against mainstream gaming companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SONY).Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]AKIKO FUJITA: Netflix is launching a test of its video game streaming services in Canada and the UK starting today. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley has the details. Dan, this is still a very limited release, but certainly marks a big step in terms of the company's ambitions in gaming.DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Akiko. This is still a beta. It's as you said limited. Only certain users in the UK and Canada are going to be able to access it. But what they're going to be offering are two different games. One is called ""Oxenfree,"" and the other is ""Molehew's Mining Adventure.""Now, these aren't the most aggressively graphics-intensive games on the market. But what it does show is that Netflix is moving forward with their gaming ambitions. They already offer mobile games on mobile platforms. If you load up Netflix on your smartphone, chances are you'll see some of the games that they offer there alongside the movies and shows that are already on there.But this is a different kind of animal. This is where you would actually be streaming the game from Netflix servers to your device. The benefit of cloud gaming is that you don't need a powerful system to run video games. You don't need a high-end PC. You don't need a pricey console. You can do it on your TV, your smartphone, your tablet, a Chromebook, an older laptop or desktop, things along those lines. And you can still get high end graphics and everything that goes along with that through cloud streaming.We see other companies in the space, but Microsoft-- sorry-- Netflix being here really is the one that we were waiting for. Everyone that has a kind of cloud gaming service, whether that's Microsoft or Sony, I generally refer to it as kind of Netflix style gaming, and now we actually have the Netflix of gaming.Story continuesWe still have to wait, though, to see whether or not they're going to roll out high-end games-- AAA games is what they're called. The ""Call of Dutys,"" things along those lines. But this is a seemingly good start for them.SEANA SMITH: Dan, how much disruption do you think Netflix is going to bring to this space? And you mentioned some of the players that have already been in gaming right now. Are they going to be able to compete with Netflix now one of the big entrants within the industry?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I mean, look, Microsoft is the leader bar none at this point. They have their Xbox Cloud Gaming. It's part of their Xbox Game Pass service. You have to get the highest level that they offer. But Sony also has its own cloud gaming offering as well. The difference between Microsoft and Sony is that Microsoft is first party Microsoft games, games that they develop or are developed by studios that they own. They put out the same day that they hit retail on their cloud gaming service. So that's a benefit for Microsoft to really say, look, we are the preeminent cloud gaming platform available.Sony is not doing that, but they are starting to work on getting PlayStation 5 games on their cloud service. There's also Nvidia and Amazon, by the way. They also have their own cloud gaming services, but it's not easy. Google had tried to run its own cloud gaming service called Stadia and folded that entirely. Now it's potentially looking at putting some kind of cloud gaming in YouTube according to the ""Wall Street Journal"", but it's not something that is necessarily easy even for companies with seemingly limitless coffers like Alphabet.So Netflix is going to really need to prove that this technology works. And even when it comes to Microsoft and what they have to offer, if there's any kind of slowdown in your internet connection, if you don't have a fast enough internet connection, or there's a lot of usage in your area and you start to run into lag, then it throws off the entire experience.It's not like where you can sit there, pause it, and let it buffer like you could do with a show or movie, this is a game that you're actively playing. And if you press a button and it doesn't respond properly you know, that instant on screen, then it's a wasted experience. So we have to see how Netflix manages to do that and what the experience is like to see if eventually they'll be able to do what Microsoft can do.And I think one of the important things to point out just real quick is, Microsoft you can use your Xbox controller. You can also do that with the Mac or PC, you can plug-in your Xbox controller. Same thing with Sony, you can do it on your Mac or PC with your PlayStation controller.Netflix isn't offering a controller. They're letting you use your smartphone. So I don't-- it's going to be tough if they end up going into more hardcore gaming, more AAA games to be able to do that with a smartphone controller, so we'll just have to see if eventually they provide support for peripherals like an Xbox controller or a PlayStation controller down the line. But, as I said, this is a big step for them. And if it does end up working out, we could see a whole new revenue stream for them down the line.AKIKO FUJITA: Dan, I have a feeling some of those challenges you talked about with gaming drawn from personal experience, right?DAN HOWLEY: Just a little. Just a little.[LAUGHTER]AKIKO FUJITA: Just a little. Just a little. Points to a lot of frustrations there as well, though. Dan Howley, thanks so much as always.]"

Management is used to telegraphing to analysts the trends in the business. But many of the retailers have had problems in the last year with excess inventory. They ordered too much and consumer demand changed from goods to experiences, like travel.Have retailers worked through their inventory issues in time for Back to School and the winter holidays?And will these reports support the “soft landing” argument?Target and 4 Other Key Retail Earnings Charts1.    Home Depot (HD) has only missed one time in the last 5 years and it was when the pandemic first started, in 2020. That’s impressive given what has happened since 2020 with supply chain and inventory issues.

If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023Photo by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the worst performing blue chip stocks in 2023, we calculated the year to date share price returns of the 30 companies on the Dow 30 index.

Earlier this month, Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) Independent Consumer &amp; Competition Commission cleared the proposed acquisition while the Canadian Competition Bureau issued a ""no action"" letter in July clearing the transaction.Other regulatory approvals to be secured for Newmont’s proposed acquisition of Newcrest include the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Australia Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), and the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC). Newmont and Newcrest also continue engaging with the PNG Government and regulators about other approvals and clearances for the transaction.On May 14, Newmont announced its definitive agreement to acquire Newcrest. The combination would create a world-class portfolio of assets with the highest concentration of Tier 1 operations, primarily in favorable, low-risk mining jurisdictions. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company would deliver a multi-decade production profile from 10 large, long-life, low cost, Tier 1 operations, and increased annual copper production primarily from Australia and Canada. The combined business is anticipated to generate annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million, expected to be achieved within the first 24 months, while also targeting at least $2 billion in the first two years after closing through portfolio optimization.1About NewmontNewmont is the world’s leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead.

107,87d02afe-4e1a-3deb-bfb4-654417afafd9,PEG,2023-08-15,Calculating The Fair Value Of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-public-enterprise-113431523.html,1692099271,STORY,['PEG'],"[Key InsightsUsing the Dividend Discount Model, Public Service Enterprise Group fair value estimate is US$61.56Public Service Enterprise Group's US$60.04 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The US$66.47 analyst price target for PEG is 8.0% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group The CalculationWe have to calculate the value of Public Service Enterprise Group slightly differently to other stocks because it is a integrated utilities company. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$60.0, the company appears about fair value at a 2.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$2.5 / (6.2% – 2.2%)= US$61.6dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Public Service Enterprise Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Public Service Enterprise GroupStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The company’s Diabetes Care business continued to benefit from the growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. However, forex woes and lower COVID sales impede growth.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 4.1% compared with 5.9% decline of the industry and a 6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned provider of a diversified line of healthcare products has a market capitalization of $183.12 billion. The company projects a 5.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Abbott’s earnings surpassed estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 12.44%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayStrong Prospects Within Core Diagnostics: Abbott is expanding its Diagnostics business foothold (consisting of nearly 30% of its total revenues in the second quarter of 2023). Although there has been a decline in demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19 over the past few quarters, it is largely offset by higher growth across other businesses. Abbott is experiencing increased demand for routine diagnostic testing in the United States and Europe. Further, in the United States, Abbott is registering strong growth within the blood transfusion testing business, which is consistently recovering from the impact of lower plasma donations during the COVID-19 pandemic.Libre Drives Diabetes Care: Abbott’s Diabetes Care business continued to benefit from the growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. In a relatively short span, FreeStyle Libre has achieved global leadership among constant glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for Type 1 and Type 2 users. In 2023, as a major milestone for the company, Libre became the first and only CGM system to be nationally reimbursed in France. In 2023, Libre received FDA clearance for connectivity with automated insulin delivery systems. Abbott is working with leading insulin pump manufacturers to integrate their systems with Libre 2 and Libre 3.Story continuesSales Recovery Within Nutrition: Following the massive setback due to the voluntary recall and production stoppage of certain infant powder formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, MI, last year, Abbott’s Nutrition business started showing signs of recovery since the beginning of 2023. Per the last update on the second-quarter earnings call, the company has made good progress in increasing manufacturing production. It has now recovered approximately 75% of the market share in the infant formula business.DownsidesForeign Exchange Translation Impacts Sales: Foreign exchange is a significant headwind for Abbott due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies has constantly been hampering the company’s performance in the international markets.In the second quarter, foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDeclining COVID Testing Dents Growth: Through the last few months of 2022 and following the official ending of the public health emergency in May, Abbott is experiencing a continuous decline in COVID testing-related demand. Through the first six months of 2023, Abbott’s Rapid Diagnostics sales decreased 67.9% from the year-ago period due to lower demand for COVID-19 tests.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 0.5% north to $4.40.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $39.77 billion, suggesting an 8.9% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Penumbra, Inc.

PDCO is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad product line. The optimism, led by a solid fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 performance and a few notable acquisitions, is expected to contribute further. Integration risks and stiff competitive forces persist.Over the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have lost 4.2% against the industry’s 18% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 15.5% during the same time frame.The renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.65 billion. It projects 9.2% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance going forward. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 4.52%, on average.Let’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from PDCO is a private-label brand named Pivotal, while it continues adding stock keeping units to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Acquisitions: We are upbeat about PDCO’s strategy of expanding its business via strategic acquisitions. In January, it announced that it had, through subsidiaries, completed the previously-announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Relief Services for Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies.In 2022, the company announced that it had, through a subsidiary, closed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Dairy Tech, Inc.Strong Q4 Results: Patterson Companies’ better-than-expected earnings in fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. Strength in the overall top line, Value-added Services and Other business of the Dental segment and the overall Animal Health segment was witnessed. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the company. Prudent cost-saving initiatives and solid sales execution continue to favor Patterson Companies.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies needs to continue to introduce newer products in the market to withstand competitive pressures. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Integration Risks: Patterson Companies has been on an acquisition spree, which is improving its revenue opportunities but aggravating integration risks. Regular acquisitions are also a distraction for management that is likely to impact organic growth. This may limit Patterson Companies’ future expansion and worsen its risk profile, going forward.Patterson Companies, Inc. PricePatterson Companies, Inc.

PacWest agreed to merge with rival Bank of California (BANC) in late July in a deal set to close next year.In the first quarter, Burry spent more than $23 million betting on financial stocks during a quarter in which Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, and Silvergate all went under in a matter of days.Scion also closed out positions in Capital One (COF) and Wells Fargo (WFC), both of which were opened during the first quarter of this year.Scion also trimmed 76% of its holdings in New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), the regional lender which acquired $38.4 billion in assets belonging to Signature Bank from the FDIC in a $2.7 billion deal.During the second quarter, the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) fell about 7%, lagging the broader Financial (XLF) sector and the S&amp;P 500, which rose 5.4% and 8.4%, respectively, over the same period.Shares of Western Alliance rose about 5.5% during the second quarter, while Huntington stock fell about 2% and PacWest dropped 13%, a move that came before the company's merger announcement.During the second quarter, Scion also sold out of its positions in Chinese e-commerce and tech companies Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).Scion did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the investments.Burry gained fame for his moves during the 2008 crisis, in which he predicted and then profited from a collapse in residential real estate prices as early as 2007.

However, ensuring enough qualifying supply to meet that demand faces ""considerable challenges,"" according to a new analysis by S&amp;P Global.The new study finds that U.S. ""energy transition demand""—demand from decarbonization technologies such as electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, solar PV, wind and batteries—will continue to accelerate and be materially higher for lithium (+15%), cobalt (+14%) and nickel (+13%) by 2035 than was projected before the IRA was enacted in August 2022.Demand for copper will be 12% higher by 2035 than pre-IRA projections. Copper is not currently listed as a critical mineral in the United States and does not qualify for IRA tax credits. However, its role as the ""metal of electrification"" makes it vital to the energy transition and demand for it will rise as it is used alongside critical minerals in energy transition applications, the study says.Adding the post-IRA demand increases on top of demand growth that was already expected prior to the IRA becoming law means that total combined energy transition-related demand for lithium, nickel and cobalt will be 23 times higher in 2035 than it was in 2021. Total demand for copper will be twice as high, the study finds.The study, entitled Inflation Reduction Act: Impact on North America Metals and Minerals Market utilizes a detailed bottom-up, technology-by-technology approach to project demand for the four metals from major energy transition applications, including power generation, transmission and distribution and end-markets, such as electric vehicles. The study then compares project demand post-IRA to available supply, given IRA rules around sourcing in terms of country of origin for production and processing.Story continuesWhile post-IRA demand is expected to be materially higher, securing enough supply under the law's sourcing requirements faces considerable challenges, the study says. To qualify for IRA tax credits, processing and/or extraction of critical minerals used must be in the United States and/ or in a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement (FTA); and that sourcing cannot involve a ""foreign entity of concern.""""This new comprehensive analysis shows that the Inflation Reduction Act is indeed transformative on the demand side,"" said Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman, S&amp;P Global. ""However, challenges remain in securing supply of critical minerals needed to meet growing demand and achieve its goal of accelerating the energy transition.""Of the four materials analyzed in the study, only lithium is likely to be sufficiently supplied to the United States under the IRA's domestic content requirements, given already-planned capacity additions in the United States and other FTA countries such as Chile, Canada and Australia, the study finds.Cobalt and nickel are both unlikely to be sourced at levels high enough to meet demand.While there is enough cobalt produced in FTA countries to meet the IRA domestic sourcing requirement, the United States does not currently source most of its cobalt from those countries. Doing so would require a challenging reorientation of trading patterns across several countries given intense international competition for resources, the study says.Nickel is the most challenged in terms of supply, the study says. There does not appear to be enough nickel supply in FTA countries to meet demand under the IRA requirements—even if all primary nickel production in FTA countries was exported to the United States.While copper is not subject to sourcing requirements under the IRA, ensuring access to enough supply to meet U.S. demand post-IRA is also at risk, the study says. The United States will become more reliant on imports as growing demand for energy transition-related end markets outpace domestic supply, the study says.For example, the United States relies on one country, Chile, for 60% of refined copper imports. However, for Chile the United States accounts for only 20% of its refined copper exports. The United States could struggle to secure additional supplies from Chile if other markets that represent a larger share of Chilean exports also compete for that supply.The increasing reliance of the United States on imports as energy transition demand grows places new emphasis and urgency on challenges such as long lead times and permitting complexities that prolong development of domestic resources, the study says. S&amp;P Global data on 127 mines across the world that began production between 2002 and 2023 shows that a major new resource discovery today would not become a productive mine until 2040 or later.Copper represents a particular opportunity in the United States. The country possesses more than 70 million tons of an untapped copper endowment, equivalent to more than 20 years of U.S. copper demand, even at the level of peak energy transition-related demand in 2035, the study says.""Timely and transparent permitting is a fundamental operational challenge to supplying metals for the energy transition, particularly in developed markets such as the United States that have high levels of transparency and both political and civil society scrutiny of policy,"" said Mohsen Bonakdarpour, Executive Director, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""Expediting permitting reform while meeting environmental and community concerns has become a central topic in boosting mineral supply for the energy transition.""About the Study:Inflation Reduction Act: Impact on North America Metals and Minerals Market is a S&amp;P Global multi-client study that offers an independent and objective assessment of the Inflation Reduction Act on the North American metals and minerals markets.

You can skip our detailed analysis on religious commitment by country, and head over directly to the 5 Most Religious Countries in the World.The PEW Research Center in 2018 identified how religious commitment varies by country and region among people of all age groups. The four standard measures they surveyed respondents over were: affiliation with religion, importance of religion in their lives, whether they pray daily, and whether or not they attend a weekly religious service.Globally, 88% of the population was affiliated with religion. 54% of the world regards religion as very important in their lives. 49% pray daily, and 39% attend a weekly worship service. Africa is the most religious region in the world, followed by the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America. In contrast, Europe and America have generally less religious people.Based on our analysis from the data sourced from PEW, Nigeria is the most religious country in the world, while China is the world’s least religious nation, where only 3% of the population regarded religion as very important, and just 1% prayed daily and attended a religious service once a week.Religiosity and Economic GrowthA study by J. Callen and X. Fang of the University of Washington, titled Religion and Stock Price Crash Risk, found evidence that companies headquartered in counties that were more religious than others had lower levels of stock price crash risk because as a set of social norms, religion helps curb bad-news-hoarding activities by managers. Findings of the National Bureau of Economic Research in a research published by Robert J. Barro and Rachel M. McCleary also stated that there is a positive relationship between religiosity and economic growth, as religious beliefs influence traits and behaviors' that enhance economic performance. Religion establishes ethical norms and social standards that are conducive to a stable economy.Story continuesOn the other hand, a study in Science Advances has stated that secular countries can expect prosperity, as a decline in religiosity influences economic growth. Researchers from the University of Bristol in the UK, and University of Tennessee worked on this research which measured the importance of religion in 109 countries between 1900-2000. However, Damian Ruck, one of the lead researchers said that the relationship between secularism and economic progress is not causal; development would only occur if secularism is accompanied with human rights. He also added that this study was not to suggest that religious countries cannot become prosperous.Religion in the Corporate WorldThere are many companies in the US that are considered to have religious influences, which in most cases, they inherited from the values of their founding fathers, or were developed over time. Chick-fil-A, for instance, is a large American fast food chain that stays closed on Sunday. The company’s website mentions that this decision was taken by its founder in 1946 to allow employees a day off to rest or worship.Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is another such company that embraces workplace spirituality. Its core values talk about being a faith-friendly organization. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) also has a chaplain program that provides pastoral care to employees in need.

Equal weightage has been assigned to all metrics, and their percentages were summed to get an aggregated score.

But when looking at the bigger picture during the first half of the year, consumer business revenue grew only 2.2% YoY to 103.5 billion yuan which equated to $14.27 billion, which is twice as less compared to 2019 and 2020's comparable period. This is the only segment with YoY comparisons as Huawei started breaking down sales by segments late last year. However, overall revenue rose 3.1% to 310.9 billion yuan. The biggest revenue contributor was the ICT infrastructure business, which includes revenue from carrier and enterprise services, with sales amounting to 167.2 billion yuan. Cloud services brought in revenue of 24.1 billion yuan. Net profit margin rose 5% YoY to 15% over the first half of the year.The EV BusinessIntelligent automotive solutions, a segment that covers tech for new energy vehicles brought in revenue of 1 billion yuan over the first half of the year. As for the company’s EV brand, Aito, whose sales are included in the consumer business, reportedly made 100,000 EVs during the last 15 months.Monetizing AIIn July, Huawei launched an AI model that enhances safety and improves the efficiency of mining operations. Despite U.S. sanctions that restricted its access to advanced process technologies, Huawei is determined to establish a strong presence in the AI-powered universe. At its Huawei Developer Conference in July, it unveiled its AI model that can be used for a wide range of industrial and scientific applications.Trouble On The Smartphone FrontHuawei expects its flagship consumer products to return to normalcy this year despite a struggling smartphone market that reached maturity, with even Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) suffering the consequences. Although Apple succeeded to beat estimates with its latest report, even the mighty Apple reported its sales fell for the third consecutive quarter. Apple got saved by all-time revenue record in services but it slightly missed iPhone sales estimates. Back in July, even Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) guiding for sales below estimates due to a slumping smartphone market. As Qualcomm reported that it does not have the license to sell 5G chips to companies, it warned of lower-than-expected sales for the undergoing quarter with consumer spending on smartphones and similar gadgets remaining weak amid a gloomy macroeconomic perspective. As Qualcomm only has a license to sell 4G chips to Huawei, it did not assume any material revenue going forward. Qualcomm also tried to diversify its business beyond smartphone chips and went into producing computer chips for the automotive sector.Story continuesChallenges Remain For HuaweiHuawei reported that back in 2022, revenue barely grew and in 2021, it recorded its first revenue decline. Huawei got blacklisted by the Trump administration in 2019, as American companies got restricted to sell to the Chinese telecommunications giant, including licensed access to the latest versions of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)-owned Google’s Android operating system. In response, Huawei released Harmony OS, its own system. Earlier this month, it unveiled the latest version that was reportedly downloaded over one million times in three days.

You can skip our detailed discussion on dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Big Companies that Stopped Paying Dividends. The pandemic in 2020 had a major impact on dividend payments. Global dividends went down significantly, and between the second and fourth quarters of 2020, the total amount of dividend cuts and cancellations reached $220 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson. Many US companies are still struggling because of the losses suffered during the pandemic and haven't been able to bring back their dividend payments. This kind of declines in dividend payouts was also witnessed during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 when dividend cuts resulted in a total loss of $40.6 billion in dividend income.Though dividend payments fell during the pandemic era, the financial positions of the companies became stronger after a few months following the pandemic as they took advantage of extremely low-interest rates and disposable income of consumers. Additionally, higher prices, increased consumer spending on products, and government assistance programs also contributed to their improved financial status. Hartford Funds also published a report on the corporate balance sheets and highlighted that companies started making money after the financial crisis as cash on their balance sheets increased by over three times since the early 2000s. The report also mentioned that the average dividend payout ratio of the S&amp;P 500 companies in the past 96 years came in at 56.3%, but by the end of December 31, 2022, the payout ratio was only 37.1%, which means there's a lot of space for growth.As the balance sheets have gotten better, dividend payments have also increased, surpassing their pre-pandemic levels. According to a report published by Wall Street Journal in June 2023, the total amount of dividends paid out in the last four quarters was $838 billion, compared with $628 billion before the pandemic.Story continuesDividend stocks are facing challenges this year as tech stocks regain their importance. Dividend payments slowed in the second quarter of 2023 due to concerns about a possible recession, earnings, and higher government and corporate debt costs. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices reported that the total net changes in dividends for U.S. common stocks rose by $4.3 billion in Q2 2023, which is lower than the $9.7 billion in Q1 2023 and $17.6 billion in Q2 2022. However, Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, gave a constructive outlook on dividend stocks and mentioned that despite a decline, dividends will remain stable for the rest of the year. He said:“The S&amp;P 500 Q2 2023 actual payment declined 2.3% from the prior quarter, as the index ended its seven consecutive quarters of record payments. Financial dividends are expected to be limited due to the recent banking events and the expected new regulatory requirements, as well as Energy payouts, which remain volatile due to the underlying oil supply and demand issues. At this point, Q3 and Q4 payments are expected to increase with the potential of Q4 setting a new record, but it will be close.”In this article, we will discuss companies that stopped paying dividends in the face of the recent pandemic or other economic conditions.15 Big Companies that Stopped Paying DividendsSource:unsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we searched for companies that have stopped paying dividends due to the pandemic, financial challenges, or cash flow management.

If you want to skip our thoughts on US's foreign aid policy, head straight to 10 Countries That Receive the Most Foreign Aid From the US.The United States, the world's largest economy, has a longstanding tradition of providing foreign aid for humanitarian causes and economic development. This aid holds more than just a moral dimension, as it harbors tangible economic and business implications. For instance, by assisting countries that receive the most foreign aid from the US in developing their infrastructure and economies, the country strategically creates avenues for its businesses.Notably, some of America's top trade partners were once beneficiaries of US foreign aid. South Korea, for example, used to get substantial aid from the US when it was mired in poverty after the Korean War. According to USAID, S. Korea has been a model user of foreign assistance as the nation joined the OECD's Development Assistance Committee in 2010 after surging from post-war destruction. If it weren't for the $13 billion aid South Korea got from the US between 1945-1995, becoming an industrial nation and maintaining an average GDP growth rate of 4.9% between 1988 and 2022 might have been more difficult. Foreign aid also facilitates access to resources, as many recipient countries are abundant in minerals, oil, or other commodities that are crucial to the US economy, but they don't have enough means to benefit from their natural treasures. Aiding a country's economy can also indirectly reduce the volatility of its currency, makes trade more predictable and safeguards American companies from the whims of fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Although the economic benefits of foreign aid are clear, its perception among the American public is inconsistent. The Borgen Project reports that, on average, Americans believe that nearly 25% of the US budget is allocated to foreign aid, and it should be reduced to 10%. But in reality, less than 1% of the federal budget is dedicated to non-military aid (which translates to $73 per American).Story continuesNotably, detractors voice concerns over potential misallocations due to corruption, the risk of fostering dependency in recipient nations, and the debate over whether such funds would yield better returns if invested domestically. But despite this, President Joe Biden's Budget Request for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is $63.1 billion, $3 billion higher than FY 2023. This $63.1 billion budget will be used for foreign assistance and diplomatic engagement through USAID. Some of the Hungriest Countries In The World are among the nations that receive the most foreign aid from the US; read our article on it for further details. Corporations Helping The Foreign Assistance SectorSeveral large corporations work in sectors related to foreign aid and development, either directly or through their subsidiaries. They often collaborate with government agencies, NGOs, and international organizations. For instance, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), in partnership with governments and NGOs, contributes resources, technology, and expertise to help mitigate the impacts of natural disasters and crises.

As the geopolitical horizon keeps changing, the countries getting the most aid from the US don't stay the same for long. But as per the last 5 years' records, here are 30 countries that receive the most foreign aid from the US:30. MaliAid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $1.15 billion Mali faces threats from extremist groups in its northern and central regions that hinders economic growth. Therefore, the US gives foreign aid to Mali that primarily supports counterterrorism initiatives and strengthens governance. Mali's current per capita GDP is $833, and 14.5% of people in the country live below the poverty line. 29. Mexico Aid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $1.29 billionMexico, along with having the highest number of immigrants in the US, is also among the biggest US aid beneficiary countries. US aid to Mexico often focuses on strengthening the rule of law and reducing drug trafficking, as these issues result in violence and unrest. The aid also aims to enhance bilateral trade and investment ties on both sides of the border.28. Haiti Aid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $1.39 billion Haiti is plagued by natural disasters and political instability. Economic challenges that stem from these issues keep Haiti the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. That's why the US provides aid to lift Haiti's democratic institutions, improve health and education, and build resilience against natural disasters. Emergency food assistance and crisis assistance are the two main aid categories that Haiti gets. 27. Niger Aid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $1.47 billionWhen a country's over 50% population survives on less than $2.15 a day, it truly needs a helping hand, which is why Niger is amongst the countries that receive the most aid from the US. The money disbursed to Niger focuses on enhancing its security capabilities and promoting sustainable agriculture. Also, USAID addresses crucial health challenges like malnutrition and maternal-child health in the country.26. Senegal Aid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $1.48 billionSenegal has cooperated with the US on various regional issues because of its democratic stance. But given that 39% population lives below the poverty line in Senegal, it requires assistance, which is why it gets a significant portion of US international aid distribution by country. American aid helps strengthen Senegal's democratic institutions and supports its health sector in combating infectious diseases.25. Zimbabwe Aid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $1.62 billionZimbabwe was once the breadbasket of Africa, but it now faces political unrest and economic decline. Therefore, to overcome human rights concerns in the country, US aid helps with democratic governance and addressing health crises, especially HIV/AIDS. Notably, the country received around $40 million from the US in 2022 alone to combat HIV/AIDS. 24. PakistanAid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $1.63 billion Pakistan's strategic importance comes from its location and role as a frontier state in war on terror. These aspects have made it a significant recipient of US aid to strengthen civilian governance, improve education and health, and counter extremist narratives. There has been a decline in aid from the US to the country in recent years. However, the US has disbursed significant aid to Pakistan post the 2008 earthquake in the country.23.

BangladeshAid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $2.46 billion Although Bangladesh has seen impressive growth since its independence in 1971, the country suffers from natural disasters, rapid urbanization, and political tension. US assistance aids in disaster preparedness and health issues that are related to maternal-child health and infectious diseases.19. MozambiqueAid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $2.75 billion Mozambique is one of the countries receiving the most foreign aid from America. The country has the 5th highest poverty rate in the world, currently standing at 64.6%. Which means almost two-thirds of its population is facing food insecurity and health crisis. The country is also struggling with the aftermath of civil war and infectious diseases. Therefore, Mozambique benefits from US aid for health improvements and to overcome food insecurity.18. TanzaniaAid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $2.88 billionTanzania's GDP is $85 billion, and nearly 44.9% of its population deals with extreme poverty.

SomaliaAid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $3.870 billion Somalia is the 4th poorest country in the world in terms of poverty rate, as its 70% population survives on less than $2.15 a day. The country has a long history of instability and threats from extremist groups, so it benefits from US aid aimed at restoring some form of stability.13. SyriaAid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $3.93 billion Syria is ravaged by a protracted civil war and is in the middle of the worst humanitarian crisis of the present times. Therefore, the US has given foreign aid of approximately $3.93 billion to the country in the past 5 years to help it overcome hunger and disease spread. 12. KenyaAid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $4.12 billion The extreme poverty rate in Kenya is 24.9% because of persistent unemployment and illiteracy. East Africa's anchor also combats threats from terrorism and health crises like HIV/AIDS.

Democratic Republic of CongoAid From The US In The Past 5 Years: $4.19 billion DR Congo has the 6th highest poverty rate worldwide, which puts it in a state of persistent food and health insecurity.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the industrials sector, head directly to 5 Best Industrial ETFs. Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL), an American real estate firm, reported that industrial markets throughout the United States displayed slower performance in 2023 compared to the previous year, given the rising inflation and economic turbulence. Initial leasing data reveals that 112.6 million leases were completed in the second quarter of 2023, marking a significant 46.9% decline in comparison to the same period last year. Even though leasing activity is currently lower than the peak seen during the pandemic, these quarterly results are more similar to the levels before the pandemic. Notably, around 50% of the leases signed in the second quarter were brand new leases, indicating a strong demand for newer industrial properties. The vacancy rate has continued to rise, reaching 4.2%, and with a wave of new properties scheduled for the third quarter, the vacancy rate is expected to keep increasing. Moreover, the rate at which new construction projects are starting has slowed down by 41.3% compared to the previous year, with only 87.9 million square feet of new projects commencing in the second quarter. This brings the total number of projects under construction to 592.9 million square feet.Don't Miss: 10 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To BuyThe manufacturing industry is currently experiencing a significant change as it integrates generative artificial intelligence. AI is being employed to optimize supply chains, improve quality control by identifying defects, and enhance process efficiency. Nevertheless, manufacturers are facing challenges pertaining to issues like job loss, safeguarding data, ethical dilemmas, dependability, and the ever-changing legal landscape. According to Deloitte, the manufacturing sector in the United States maintained its strong performance in 2022, further strengthening the positive trajectory it started after the pandemic and exceeding predictions from the previous two years. Policy measures like the CHIPS Act and IRA are poised to support the ongoing revival of the manufacturing sector. Projections by Deloitte, relying on Oxford Economics' Global Economic Model, foresee a 2.5% increase in manufacturing GDP for 2023.Story continuesAs per CBRE’s market outlook for industrial and logistics sectors, 2023 is supposed to bring moderation in industrial leasing activity within the United States, driven by occupiers postponing their expansion plans and a reduced need to hold excess inventory post-pandemic. Despite this deceleration, demand will remain balanced with supply during the year, leading to a 13th consecutive year of positive net absorption and steady growth in rent prices. The driving forces for this demand include the growth of e-commerce, the evolution of supply chains, and efforts to optimize location choices. CBRE noted that although there has been improvement in global supply chains, there's still uncertainty due to potential disruptions like port backlogs, labor issues, adverse weather, and geopolitical conflicts. To counter these risks, businesses are diversifying their product sourcing, adopting strategies such as a ""China Plus One"" approach, where they expand beyond relying solely on China for manufacturing and labor. On a positive note, larger retailers, occupiers, and logistics companies are likely to continue expanding to strengthen their distribution capabilities despite the overall economic slowdown. However, smaller businesses lack the financial reserves to do so. Also Read: 10 Best Cybersecurity ETFsSome of the best industrial stocks to buy include PulteGroup, Inc.

Current airframe production is running materially below expected travel demand over the next 5-10 years, creating a structural supply/demand imbalance that we believe will drive a decade of strong growth in civil aerospace from here.

Now that the Northeast expansion is largely complete, Saia is entering a new phase of growth that should unlock additional operating leverage. In addition, we believe Saia has the virtuous opportunity to grow its delivery network at a healthy pace while realizing higher prices as this strengthened network results in higher quality service levels to customers. We are very cognizant of the slowing economy and the likelihood that the industry’s (and Saia’s) shipment volumes will decline in the coming quarters.

Considering the current situation, an investor might not be encouraged to invest in the stock market. However, a prudent investor knows that this is the right time to buy stocks that are safe bets.In the current scenario, we recommend stocks like Arcosa ACA, PulteGroup PHM, Livent LTHM, Atmos Energy ATO and Teekay Tankers TNK, which bear low leverage. These picks can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.The crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.The equity market can be volatile at times and as an investor, if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.Story continuesWith the second-quarter earnings cycle almost in its last lap, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen.Arcosa: It is a manufacturer of infrastructure-related products and services, which serve construction, energy and transportation markets.

In 2022, the surgical robotics market held a value of $8.6 billion, and it’s projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 8%, reaching $15.8 billion by 2030.Story continuesAI Stock: Palantir (PLTR)Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo seen on billboard, known as Palantir is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.comLast week, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) the “Messi of AI.” Ives is the Managing Director for the firm’s Technology Sector desk, so, if anyone is qualified to forecast an AI stock’s potential, it’s him.  In the interview, Ives told the anchor that Palantir had “…a golden path right now [to] monetize what we view as a potentially $1 trillion market opportunity, and investors still have not recognized what this golden use could be.” That’s a big deal, considering Palantir is already popular among AI investors. Already, Palantir has made significant waves amid the ongoing Eastern European conflict, delivering AI-enabled targeting results to Ukraine. Critically, though, Palantir has been in the AI space for more than two decades. The company has been quietly securing government and corporate contracts before it burst on the scene in 2020.This longevity means Palantir isn’t simply riding an AI wave – it’s a core part of a growing industry.AI Stock: Trimble (TRMB)The Trimble (TRMB) headquarters in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comTrimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) is using advanced robotics to change the way construction companies complete projects. In June, Trimble and partner Boston Dynamics used the mobile robot dog Spot (already popular online from a series of testing videos) on a major construction project. The robot dog, smaller and nimbler than its human counterparts, used Trimble-enabled laser scanning technology to help site managers conduct quality control and find structural weaknesses in the project.At the same time, Trimble is using AI to transform agriculture and farming. The company’s AI-driven path-planning technology is a significant part of off-road autonomous vehicles in agriculture. Basically, this means Trimble’s AI software is already working in the field to steer harvesting, spraying, and even soil-rolling equipment. Trimble’s diverse applications across critical industries mean the firm is well-positioned to be a dominant player in robotics and advanced AI moving forward.Robotics Stock: Caterpillar (CAT)The back of a Caterpillar (CAT) work vehicle displaying company logoSource: ShutterstockIn 2020, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) acquired a major Californian robotics company, and that investment is bearing fruit today. Caterpillar is using robotics, developed in-house and through its previous acquisition, to change the construction industry further. Today, that market remains untapped as only 13% of contractors use the technologies, but more than 60% think they’ll be critical in the future. Caterpillar’s robotics solutions aren’t restricted to typical construction projects, either. In March, one solar company unveiled a robot built on Caterpillar’s platform that fully automates digging and trenching operations for solar farm installation.With Caterpillar’s industry dominance and ability to produce massive equipment at scale, they’re ready to pivot wholly into robotics as the field delivers safer construction sites and more effective development projects.AI Stock: Deere &amp; Company (DE)a green John Deere tractorSource: mark stephens photography / Shutterstock.comDeere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) uses robotics to achieve global sustainability goals, making the stock perfect for an impact-focused portfolio. In January, the company unveiled its ExactShot technology. The equipment reduces fertilizer waste by more than 60%, saving farmers money and reducing ground pollution.That isn’t the end, though. Through robotics and predictive AI application, Vice President Deanna Jovar predicts that “eventually, we will literally treat every plant on an acre of a field differently based on what we’re learning through our computer vision and machine-learning tech.”Like Caterpillar, Deere &amp; Company’s (known widely as John Deere) agriculture industry dominance and production scale position the company perfectly for a global robotics pivot in farming.Robotics Stock: General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) uses advanced robotics on its vehicle assembly lines – and has for years. However, its advancements in peripheral robotic applications bode well for the stock. In 2022 GM partnered with NASA to develop a humanoid robot to assist humans on the ground and in space. The partnership is a no-brainer. GM’s existing robotics tech is adapted to the delicate maneuvering required for car creation and space-based science projects.GM benefits from the partnership, too, though. With NASA, GM is developing a series of sensor and control technology they can employ across their production facilities at scale. Vice President for Global Research and Development Alan Taub summed up the benefits to GM: “When it comes to future vehicles, the advancements in controls, sensors and vision technology can be used to develop advanced vehicle safety systems [and build] better, higher quality vehicles in a safer, more competitive manufacturing environment.”GM’s been on a winning streak recently, partnering with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to expand electric vehicle charging networks. Ultimately, GM’s been at the forefront of many robotics revolutions, and the undervalued stock has a strong future based on its tech.AI Stock: AeroVironment (AVAV)The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) is an underappreciated defense sector company with substantial prospects in AI. This company primarily develops drone tools. AeroVironment is best known for its flagship Raven UAS, extensively used by the US military and international allies. However, their secondary products conceal a wealth of AI potential, a move made ahead of the recent boom in AI trends.The company already sees a demand surge for UAS products in the Ukrainian conflict. Critically, AeroVironment secured a spot in the US Army’s Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems project. The project will see AeroVironment deliver four air-based vehicles alongside a suite of mission control tools. Enabled by AI, AeroVironment’s future UAS projects will be on the cutting edge of the defense industry.Wall Street is already taking notice of AeroVironment’s AI potential. The stock saw its short interest drop in July. At the same time, major institutional players are buying up AeroVironment stock as fast as they can. Investment giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) owns 18% of the company, and, if there’s anything retail investors interested in AI should do, it’s follow the smart money. And the smart money is betting on AeroVironment.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint had a LONG position in GM.

You can skip our detailed discussion on dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Big Companies that Stopped Paying Dividends. The pandemic in 2020 had a major impact on dividend payments. Global dividends went down significantly, and between the second and fourth quarters of 2020, the total amount of dividend cuts and cancellations reached $220 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson. Many US companies are still struggling because of the losses suffered during the pandemic and haven't been able to bring back their dividend payments. This kind of declines in dividend payouts was also witnessed during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 when dividend cuts resulted in a total loss of $40.6 billion in dividend income.Though dividend payments fell during the pandemic era, the financial positions of the companies became stronger after a few months following the pandemic as they took advantage of extremely low-interest rates and disposable income of consumers. Additionally, higher prices, increased consumer spending on products, and government assistance programs also contributed to their improved financial status. Hartford Funds also published a report on the corporate balance sheets and highlighted that companies started making money after the financial crisis as cash on their balance sheets increased by over three times since the early 2000s. The report also mentioned that the average dividend payout ratio of the S&amp;P 500 companies in the past 96 years came in at 56.3%, but by the end of December 31, 2022, the payout ratio was only 37.1%, which means there's a lot of space for growth.As the balance sheets have gotten better, dividend payments have also increased, surpassing their pre-pandemic levels. According to a report published by Wall Street Journal in June 2023, the total amount of dividends paid out in the last four quarters was $838 billion, compared with $628 billion before the pandemic.Story continuesDividend stocks are facing challenges this year as tech stocks regain their importance. Dividend payments slowed in the second quarter of 2023 due to concerns about a possible recession, earnings, and higher government and corporate debt costs. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices reported that the total net changes in dividends for U.S. common stocks rose by $4.3 billion in Q2 2023, which is lower than the $9.7 billion in Q1 2023 and $17.6 billion in Q2 2022. However, Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, gave a constructive outlook on dividend stocks and mentioned that despite a decline, dividends will remain stable for the rest of the year. He said:“The S&amp;P 500 Q2 2023 actual payment declined 2.3% from the prior quarter, as the index ended its seven consecutive quarters of record payments. Financial dividends are expected to be limited due to the recent banking events and the expected new regulatory requirements, as well as Energy payouts, which remain volatile due to the underlying oil supply and demand issues. At this point, Q3 and Q4 payments are expected to increase with the potential of Q4 setting a new record, but it will be close.”In this article, we will discuss companies that stopped paying dividends in the face of the recent pandemic or other economic conditions.15 Big Companies that Stopped Paying DividendsSource:unsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we searched for companies that have stopped paying dividends due to the pandemic, financial challenges, or cash flow management.

To skip our detailed analysis of conservative investing in the current market, you can go directly to see the Conservative Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks To Buy.Markets are jittery again amid analyst firms downgrading banks and some circles still warning about recession despite inflation showing some signs of cooling. At the same time, the US is going through a rough patch in terms of its debt rating, what with the Fitch Ratings downgrading US debt from AAA to AA+, a move that was claimed to be influenced by deteriorating governance standards. The US financial sector is also facing yet another challenge, with Moody's this time downgrading about 11 US banks while taking 16 other negative rating actions on other regional banks in the country. All of these moves have come about in close succession to one another in July and August, putting the everyday investor in a frantic state of mind when it comes to figuring out where they can put their money and be able to rest easy.What Is Conservative Investing?Considering the above, there are many investors today who are looking for safe and reliable stock options to beef up their portfolios and ensure they aren't hit too hard by worrying market conditions. Because of this, conservative investing is a strategy that is coming to the forefront. This strategy entails a defensive investment style with a focus on low-risk investments. The aim of the strategy is to achieve capital security while providing investors with steady and reliable income and protection for their invested capital. Many investors look at reliable dividend stocks as part of this strategy since these stocks offer steady passive income that can tide them by in volatile markets. Blue chip stocks, or generally renowned companies with solid balance sheets and financial strength, are also top picks for conservative stock portfolios.Story continuesWhile building a conservative stock portfolio in the second half of 2023, investors can take a look at several sectors that have been performing well and are expected to continue this level of performance later in the year as well. These include the tech and consumer staples sectors and even the healthcare sector, among others. On August 14, Paul Meeks, a tech investor and portfolio manager at Independent Solutions Wealth Management, was invited to CNBC's TechCheck, and he said the following about the tech sector in particular:""What I've seen is that there were a number of tech stocks that deserved to have big 2023 ramps, and there were a number of tech stocks that probably were frauds that didn't deserve it. And so unfortunately, the whole sector got grossly overbought, and now we're starting to see some reality, we're starting to see some consolidation, and I actually think that consolidation might continue a bit further.""Buying Opportunities In TechMeeks' insights on the tech sector can prove valuable to any conservative investors looking to buy into this sector today since he clearly lays out the ground reality of the sector by stating that stocks within this area have been overbought by eager investors. Despite this, Meeks stated that while tech weakness is expected to continue, he does see a ""buying opportunity"" in some tech names. The mega-cap stocks Meeks is favoring so far include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). He sees further upside for these stocks and several others in the tech sector today.However, conservative investors should keep in mind that tech is not the only sector they can invest in at this point. While it has been overwhelmingly dominating market discourse so far this year, other sectors, such as healthcare and consumer staples, are also equally good conservative plays because of their historical performance and reliability, especially in times of recession. Considering these factors, we have compiled a list of some of the best conservative stocks to buy today. By following lists like these, investors can build up conservative stock portfolios full of some of the best stocks to buy for long-term gains as well. Additionally, these names can also be considered some of the top safe stocks to buy for beginner investors today.Conservative Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks To BuyPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 10 conservative (safe, reliable and defensive) stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc.

If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc.

141,4a3c5c1a-ab35-3c9e-b162-6248929074dc,MOS,2023-08-15,The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 88% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-company-nyse-mos-favoured-103918881.html,1692095958,STORY,['MOS'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Mosaic's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions50% of the business is held by the top 11 shareholdersOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockTo get a sense of who is truly in control of The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mosaic. Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mosaic?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Mosaic does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Mosaic's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Mosaic. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 8.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of MosaicThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Mosaic Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$85m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Mosaic. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Mosaic (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

It's calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor derived from the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock is potentially overvalued, indicating poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock is likely undervalued, suggesting higher future returns.With its current price of $40.3 per share, The Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) appears to be significantly undervalued. Therefore, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.The Mosaic Co (MOS): A Significantly Undervalued Gem in the Agriculture IndustryLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of The Mosaic CoInvesting in companies with poor financial strength often carries a higher risk of permanent capital loss.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the industrials sector, head directly to 5 Best Industrial ETFs. Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL), an American real estate firm, reported that industrial markets throughout the United States displayed slower performance in 2023 compared to the previous year, given the rising inflation and economic turbulence. Initial leasing data reveals that 112.6 million leases were completed in the second quarter of 2023, marking a significant 46.9% decline in comparison to the same period last year. Even though leasing activity is currently lower than the peak seen during the pandemic, these quarterly results are more similar to the levels before the pandemic. Notably, around 50% of the leases signed in the second quarter were brand new leases, indicating a strong demand for newer industrial properties. The vacancy rate has continued to rise, reaching 4.2%, and with a wave of new properties scheduled for the third quarter, the vacancy rate is expected to keep increasing. Moreover, the rate at which new construction projects are starting has slowed down by 41.3% compared to the previous year, with only 87.9 million square feet of new projects commencing in the second quarter. This brings the total number of projects under construction to 592.9 million square feet.Don't Miss: 10 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To BuyThe manufacturing industry is currently experiencing a significant change as it integrates generative artificial intelligence. AI is being employed to optimize supply chains, improve quality control by identifying defects, and enhance process efficiency. Nevertheless, manufacturers are facing challenges pertaining to issues like job loss, safeguarding data, ethical dilemmas, dependability, and the ever-changing legal landscape. According to Deloitte, the manufacturing sector in the United States maintained its strong performance in 2022, further strengthening the positive trajectory it started after the pandemic and exceeding predictions from the previous two years. Policy measures like the CHIPS Act and IRA are poised to support the ongoing revival of the manufacturing sector. Projections by Deloitte, relying on Oxford Economics' Global Economic Model, foresee a 2.5% increase in manufacturing GDP for 2023.Story continuesAs per CBRE’s market outlook for industrial and logistics sectors, 2023 is supposed to bring moderation in industrial leasing activity within the United States, driven by occupiers postponing their expansion plans and a reduced need to hold excess inventory post-pandemic. Despite this deceleration, demand will remain balanced with supply during the year, leading to a 13th consecutive year of positive net absorption and steady growth in rent prices. The driving forces for this demand include the growth of e-commerce, the evolution of supply chains, and efforts to optimize location choices. CBRE noted that although there has been improvement in global supply chains, there's still uncertainty due to potential disruptions like port backlogs, labor issues, adverse weather, and geopolitical conflicts. To counter these risks, businesses are diversifying their product sourcing, adopting strategies such as a ""China Plus One"" approach, where they expand beyond relying solely on China for manufacturing and labor. On a positive note, larger retailers, occupiers, and logistics companies are likely to continue expanding to strengthen their distribution capabilities despite the overall economic slowdown. However, smaller businesses lack the financial reserves to do so. Also Read: 10 Best Cybersecurity ETFsSome of the best industrial stocks to buy include PulteGroup, Inc.

Saia has been opening new terminals across the Northeast, and its terminal count has increased from 151 at the end of 2016 to 187 as of Q4 2022. Now that the Northeast expansion is largely complete, Saia is entering a new phase of growth that should unlock additional operating leverage. In addition, we believe Saia has the virtuous opportunity to grow its delivery network at a healthy pace while realizing higher prices as this strengthened network results in higher quality service levels to customers. We are very cognizant of the slowing economy and the likelihood that the industry’s (and Saia’s) shipment volumes will decline in the coming quarters.

He said that Ryanair ""would like to grow in Germany"" but does not need to do so to reach its overall goal of flying 300 million passengers a year by March 2034.Ryanair trimmed its full-year passenger forecast last month to 183.5 million passengers from 185 million due to the impact of air traffic control strikes and potential further Boeing delivery delays.Wilson said on Monday that Ryanair had now received all its new aircraft for this summer and was happy with the schedule Boeing has provided for the next tranche of deliveries from October.""At the moment we have an agreed timetable.

Analysts recommend that investors should keep adding dividend stocks to their portfolios, as these stocks are expected to show growth in the second half of the year. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson Investors, reviewed the first half of 2023 and presented a positive outlook on dividend stocks. He said that so far this year, dividends have been increasing, boosted by special dividends and share buybacks. Cash generation is still robust with many larger companies transferring the added expenses due to inflation to their customers. He further highlighted that the dividend outlook is strong. However, as the impact of increased interest rates affects both companies and consumers, it's important to diversify investments and prioritize companies with solid financial standings.

If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023Photo by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the worst performing blue chip stocks in 2023, we calculated the year to date share price returns of the 30 companies on the Dow 30 index.

Total sponsorship value grew to at least $349 million, from $342 million in 2019, according to GlobalData, with many brands aligning themselves with themes of women's empowerment.At DICK's, where 76 clothing and products tied to the 2023 U.S. Women's National Team were available online on Monday, more than two-thirds are discounted by 25% to 35%, including jerseys, tee-shirts and hoodies, according to a check of its website.Nike’s marketing ahead of the Women’s World Cup featured a football fan telling her father that “the competition is better than ever,” with cameos from a roster of past and current stars, including U.S. players Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, French player Grace Geyoro, and Barcelona forward Asisat Oshoala.The retailer also released a collaboration with designer Martine Rose worn by the United States Women’s National Team ahead of their first match. The collection included tailored pieces such as trousers, a suit jacket and a trench coat featuring the Nike swoosh, along with a slip-on mule resembling a football cleat.A release from Nike stated that the collection “dissolves the boundaries of men and women’s football styling,” and most pieces are sold out on the designer’s website.Story continuesOverall for Nike, which sponsors the U.S., England, and others, only 8% of women's team products have sold out thus far during the tournament, according data collected by Centric Pricing and Refinitiv. That's down from 13% of Nike's women's team products which sold out during the same tournament in 2019, the data shows.At rival Adidas, which sponsors Sweden and Spain-- the teams that go head to head in Tuesday's semi-final-- 21% of women's team products have sold out so far over this year's tournament, up from 8% in 2019.Adidas doubled its production of Germany women's team jerseys for this World Cup, compared to the 2019 tournament, and was still on the verge of selling out when the team fell out of the running early. ""That tells you something about the exponential growth of the sport,"" said Adidas spokesman Jan Runau.FANBASE DRAWS BRANDSOne in three fans of women's soccer are new to soccer full stop, according to Yvonne Henderson, CEO of UK-based industry association Women In Football. ""The fanbase is unique, it's diverse, it's quite youthful and it has strong progressive values,"" she said.For that reason, marketers must bear in mind the risk that the growing fanbase could see their support for women's soccer as disingenuous. ""Their message has to come off as sincere, and must be backed by action and long-term commitment as opposed to just 30 seconds of bluster that ends when the event is over,"" said Bob Dorfman, creative director at Pinnacle Advertising.Nike, for example, sponsor of England's Lionesses, faced criticism from goalkeeper Mary Earps for not producing a replica goalkeeper jersey. Adidas, which does not produce women's goalkeeper jerseys for the teams it sponsors either, said that was a mistake, with CEO Bjorn Gulden adding that the whole industry is on a ""learning curve"".French telecom company Orange's World Cup advertisement seeks to directly challenge the notion that women's soccer is less skilful or exciting than the men's game, while Adobe's ad with Germany's Bayern Munich women's team includes a voiceover saying: ""Our game is proudly different.""To recognize the impact grassroots teams have in creating excitement about women's soccer, Adobe's ad also featured London-based community women's soccer clubs Peaches FC and Baesianz FC, said Sabina Strasser, Senior Director, Brand Experience EMEA at Adobe.Sporting goods retailer Fanatics has more than 475 U.S. women's team products for sale this year, up from about 175 in 2019, the company told Reuters. Overall, in the month leading up to the start of this year's tournament, sales of women's soccer products on Fanatics were up more than 80% compared to the last Women's World Cup in 2019.But since the surprise early exit of the two-time champions, it had to change tack by promoting merchandise that isn't specifically tied to the U.S. team. As of Monday, the generic Adidas Women's World Cup soccer ball was among its top sellers in FIFA World Cup Gear.(Reporting by Amy Tennery in Auckland, Sheila Dang in Dallas, Texas, and Kate Masters in New York.; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)]"

Several patients see a relapse after stopping treatment, making it an area of unmet need that drugmakers can tap into.Other similar antibody therapies in the market include Roche's Columvi, Abbvie's Epkinly and Johnson &amp; Johnson's Talvey, which was approved last week.Elrexfio can be used ""off-the-shelf"" and can be delivered on an ongoing basis by healthcare providers in hospitals and clinics, the company said on Monday.The FDA approval is based on data from a mid-stage study that showed that 58% of patients treated with Pfizer's therapy had no signs of cancer or had seen a significant decrease in cancer cells in the body.Pfizer said it will continue testing the therapy in ongoing late-stage trials to expand its use in earlier lines of treatment for patients.The therapy's approval comes with a boxed warning for neurologic toxicity and cytokine release syndrome, a condition where the immune system reacts more aggressively.

(NYSE:PFE) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval to ELREXFIO™ (elranatamab-bcmm) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Approval was based on the results of the single-arm Phase 2 MagnetisMM-3 trial, and continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). ELREXFIO is a subcutaneously delivered B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-CD3-directed bispecific antibody (BsAb) immunotherapy that binds to BCMA on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells, bringing them together and activating the T-cells to kill myeloma cells.""ELREXFIO reflects our ongoing commitment to developing scientific breakthroughs that meaningfully improve outcomes for people with cancer. Discovered at Pfizer, we advanced this therapy from a first-in-patient trial to approval in less than five years, because we know that time is life for people living with multiple myeloma,"" said Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President of Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer. ""With significant responses in a patient population with highly refractory disease, we believe ELREXFIO is poised to potentially become the new standard of care for multiple myeloma, as we plan to build upon this indication with continued development across the expansive MagnetisMM program.""Story continuesThe approval of ELREXFIO is based on data from response rates and duration of response. Data from cohort A (n=123) of the Phase 2 MagnetisMM-3 study (NCT04649359) showed meaningful responses among heavily pretreated RRMM patients who received ELREXFIO as their first BCMA-directed therapy. Among the patients in this study who received four or more lines of therapy prior to ELREXFIO (n=97), the overall response rate was 58%, with an estimated 82% maintaining the response for at least nine months. The median time to first response was 1.2 months. This study also established ELREXFIO as the first BCMA-directed therapy in the U.S. with once-every-other-week dosing for responding patients after 24 weeks of weekly therapy, which means less time at the clinic and potentially greater long-term treatment tolerability. The label also includes data from MagnetisMM-3 cohort B (n=64). Among the 63 patients in this cohort who received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a BCMA-directed therapy (CAR-T or antibody-drug conjugate), the overall response rate was 33% after a median follow-up of 10.2 months, with an estimated 84% maintaining the response for at least nine months.In longer-term efficacy data for cohort A (n=123) presented at the 2023 European Hematology Association meeting, the objective response rate was 61%, and median duration of response, overall survival, and progression-free survival had not yet been reached at 14.7 months median follow-up. For the responding patients, the probability of maintaining a response at 15 months was 72%. Among responding patients who switched to every-other-week dosing at least six months prior to the data cut-off date (n=50), 80% maintained or improved their response after the switch, with 38% attaining a complete response or better after the switch.""Most multiple myeloma patients will experience relapse or resistance of their disease to treatment, often facing increased symptom burden and lowering their chance of surviving longer with each attempted line of therapy,"" said MagnetisMM clinical trial investigator Ajay Nooka, MD, MPH, Director of the Multiple Myeloma Program at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. ""By offering durable clinical response with an established safety profile and the convenience of subcutaneous administration, ELREXFIO provides a much-needed new option for heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients who are struggling with relapsed myeloma.""ELREXFIO’s label contains a Boxed Warning for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity (NT), including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), in addition to warnings and precautions for infections, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity and embryo-fetal toxicity. The most common adverse reactions to ELREXFIO (incidence ≥20%) are CRS, fatigue, injection site reaction, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, musculoskeletal pain, pneumonia, decreased appetite, rash, cough, nausea, and fever (pyrexia). The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥20%) are decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased hemoglobin, decreased white blood cells, and decreased platelets. The step-up dose regimen (12/32/76 mg), combined with acetaminophen, dexamethasone, and diphenhydramine pre-treatment, is intended to reduce the incidence and severity of CRS. As a precaution, patients should be hospitalized for 48 hours following the first step-up dose and for 24 hours following the second step-up dose. No hospitalization is required for the third step-up dose. Given the risk of CRS and NT, including ICANS, ELREXFIO is available only through a restricted program called the ELREXFIO Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). A confirmatory trial (MagnetisMM-5) in the double-class exposed relapsed or refractory population involving 854 patients was initiated in 2022 to gather additional safety and efficacy data. Data will be shared as available.""Accessibility is key to unlocking the potential impact of new treatment options. Unfortunately, novel therapies for triple-class-exposed multiple myeloma can be out of reach for medically underserved populations,"" said Jenny Ahlstrom, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the HealthTree Foundation for Multiple Myeloma. ""With the approval of ELREXFIO, patients have a new off-the-shelf treatment option that can be delivered on an ongoing basis in community clinics, where the majority of patients with multiple myeloma receive their care.""For patients who are prescribed ELREXFIO, Pfizer offers the support of Patient Access Navigators, through our Pfizer Oncology Together program, who provide personalized services for all aspects of treatment, including financial assistance resources, treatment support, and resources to navigate potential insurance and coverage issues.ELREXFIO received Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Orphan Drug Designations and was approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program, which is designed to shorten the time of FDA review for drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. The FDA review was also conducted under Project Orbis, a framework for the concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international partners to potentially expedite approvals. Currently, five countries (Switzerland, Brazil, Canada, Australia, and Singapore) are participating. A new drug application for ELREXFIO is being evaluated by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Additionally, a marketing authorization application for ELREXFIO is currently being evaluated under the PRIME scheme by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).The extensive MagnetisMM clinical development program is investigating ELREXFIO’s use across the entire spectrum of myeloma progression, from newly diagnosed multiple myeloma to RRMM. Ongoing registrational-intent trials are exploring ELREXFIO both as monotherapy and in combination with standard or novel therapies. These include the Phase 3 MagnetisMM-5 trial in the double-class exposed setting and MagnetisMM-7 with ELREXFIO as maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed patients after transplant.View the full Prescribing Information, including the Boxed Warning and patient Medication Guide.

Healthy plasma cells make antibodies that help the body fight infection.1 MM is the second most common type of blood cancer, with over 35,000 new cases of MM diagnosed annually in the U.S. and 176,000 globally.2,3 About half of those diagnosed with MM won’t survive beyond five years, and most will receive four or more lines of therapy due to relapse.4 While disease trajectory varies for each person, relapses are nearly inevitable.5 Real-world evidence shows that people with RRMM often become resistant to the three main classes of treatment – proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies – after just a few rounds of therapy, and re-treating with these classes was common.6 The goal of therapy for people with RRMM is to achieve disease control with acceptable toxicity and improved quality of life.7What is the most important information I should know about ELREXFIO?ELREXFIO (elranatamab-bcmm) may cause side effects that are serious, life-threatening, or can lead to death, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic problems.Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of CRS or neurologic problems at any time during your treatment with ELREXFIO.Cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

The company naming Intuit executive Alex Chriss as its next chief executive and will take over on September 27. Joining us now is Steve Biggar, Argus Research Director of Financial Services Research. Good to talk to you today. Give me your take here with Alex Chriss now being tapped to run the company. What does it mean for PayPal's turnaround?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yes. Hi, Akiko. I think this is a good fit. The more I read about Alex Chriss's background, the more I like. I think he's-- you know, the stint at Intuit and, you know, integrating acquisitions and the focus on small businesses, and, of course, they do have some payment capabilities as well there, all lines up to be a pretty good fit. So I think the move today that, you know, roughly 3% increase in the share price today is appropriate. I think it's also a bit of a sigh of relief that Dan Schulman, his replacement has been found.The company has been through some executive shake-ups here. They had a CFO, of course, that left for Walmart. They replaced him. He was at a very short stint and then out for medical. And the investor relations director has been filling in there. So, you know, it's been a bit of a void here. And I also like the fact that Schulman will be around through May of next year to make for an easy transition and hopefully, a faster learning curve.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Steve, what do you think the top priority needs to be for Alex Chriss? Because he's taking over at a time, which is pretty challenging. We have a softening consumer. We also know that PayPal has already been undergoing some cost-cutting measures. But what do you think needs to be at the top of the list as we talk about getting PayPal and strategizing that company here for the future?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah. Sure, Seana. I think the focus is what you're mentioning there. You know, they have a lot of competition in the payment space that they have to watch out for. They have to be continued to be very innovative. And PayPal has been on a number of fronts. They've had some struggle with margin expansion here as they focus more on the back business and then the payment button business, which is a little bit more lucrative for them. So all of those are key focuses.They did outright state that the cost-cutting was coming in advance of a new CEO. So we would not have to come in with, what I wouldn't call a bloated cost structure here, but just a little bit more efficient. One could say maybe they hired a little bit during the pandemic when everything was surging in terms of digital payments. So I think all of those things are going to have to be a focus for the new CEO here.AKIKO FUJITA: Steve, who do you think poses the biggest competitive threat to PayPal right now? You know, Apple Pay, that's one that's been raised a lot. But there's certainly a lot of other competitors. This is a space that is much more crowded or has become much throughout the years.STEPHEN BIGGAR: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. You know, the big players, you still have Square. Of course, they focus more on the small and micro merchant business. You've got just outright Visa and Mastercard. You got bank cards. You've got Apple Pay. You've got Stripe. You've got all the affiliations with buy-now-pay-laters, which are taking share PayPal has their own. So they're being competitive in that space.It is a crowded and competitive landscape. But the thing to remember about PayPal is that they're unique, in that you can both be paid and pay and be paid on the platform. You can transfer money with Venmo. You can use cryptocurrencies now. Of course, they had some innovation there last week. So I think they have the name brand. They're certainly the platform that is most prevalent, has a checkout button as well, the number one there. So they have a lot of key competitive advantages, I think, that certainly make them, you know, very competitive in the space and able to grow, not just in the payment space because of their strategy, but the tailwind of the secular-- the tailwind that we have in terms of more payments being migrated to digital and away from cash and checks and the like.AKIKO FUJITA: When you think about PayPal stock, this is one that has seen steep declines. We were saying in 2021 that peak was $360 in terms of the valuation of the or market cap of the company, now at roughly $70 billion. You talked about potential upsides here. What do you think is going to be the big catalyst?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yes. Well, of course, 2020 and 2021 were big years in the digital payment space. You had an acceleration of that digital migration during the pandemic. And I think obviously, that pulled forward a lot of growth in those years. And now, they're paying for it a bit with more sluggish growth this year and next, although I will point out that earnings this year should exceed the prior peak of 2021.So in terms of valuation, I think you're looking at, you know, a stock that has a kind of a mid-teens growth, is a fairly durable number to expect from them. I apply about a little over 1 peg or 1.1 peg, so about an 18 PE, And come up with an $88 target price, which is-- indicates the shares are about 30% to 35% undervalued at this point.So I think the catalyst here, a few things that have held the stock back, including the CEO replacement, the need for a permanent CFO, still at this point, and just start executing on that get the lower cost structure in place and start executing on the earnings growth trajectory that they had previous to the pandemic.AKIKO FUJITA: Steve Biggar, Argus Research Director of Financial Services Research, good talk-- good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time.STEPHEN BIGGAR: Thank you.]"

175,08b7108c-375e-3181-ba81-b27d141328e8,IBM,2023-08-15,15 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-worst-performing-blue-chip-113530961.html,1692099330,STORY,"['KO', 'DIS', 'IBM', 'JNJ', 'VZ', 'CVX', 'UNH', 'AMGN', 'MRK', 'WBA', 'NKE', 'MMM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 worst performing blue chip stocks in 2023. If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023Photo by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the worst performing blue chip stocks in 2023, we calculated the year to date share price returns of the 30 companies on the Dow 30 index.

And we're actively exploring ways to increase our gross profit margin on subscription revenue within Flagship and move closer to the 50% margin that we attained at CloudFirst.Additionally, our equipment and software group generated $2.4 million in the second quarter compared to $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2022. Notably, CloudFirst as a standalone achieved $3.2 million in revenue for the second quarter with net income of over $550,000 and $800,000 in EBITDA, which is a 25% margin.We plan to continue to drive revenues by executing on our business initiatives, including expanding distribution channels, increasing our digital and direct marketing programs, continuing our lead generation program, hosting additional revenue-driven sales events, and exploring strategic M&amp;A opportunities to assist with the overall growth of our company. Importantly, there is significant need for innovative solutions on a global basis as expanding internationally and increasing our geographic footprint and addressable market are priorities for us.Another validation of our growing presence in the marketplace is the fact that we had over 45,000 visitors to our websites year to date. We also have over $9 million in total contract value and proposals to potential clients.In addition, we have what we refer to as a nurture group of companies with over 25,000 organizations that receive our information that do not opt out and receive marketing and technical information they've continued to send over the years and interface with them on an ongoing basis.Companies on this list have expressed interest in implementing our solutions and could provide meaningful revenue, should we secure new contracts. In particular, and perhaps more important to note, are the secured contracts announced recently, which we believe demonstrates our contract momentum during the second quarter and into the third quarter of 2023. Many of these are high margin, subscription-based contracts.Let me touch on these contracts quickly, and I'd like to highlight that we continue to maintain a 94% renewal rate with an average term of 29 months, validating that we continually meet or exceed our clients' needs.First, we secured a multi-million-dollar contract with a leading business process solution provider that has customers around the world. We're implementing cloud-based infrastructure to support their large data sets while providing 24/7 dedicated support and data recovery services. Our solutions allow for the client to run at full performance during planned maintenance or unplanned outages. This contract provides an avenue to penetrate international markets, and we intend to pursue the opportunities.Next, we secured a large subscription-based contract with a promotional products company. This contract specifically came through our Flagship subsidiary, and we believe illustrates we're executing on our goal of increasing Flagship recurring subscription-based revenue contracts. This customer sought us out following an unpredictable natural disaster.Unfortunately, following this event, the customer quickly realized that they were unable to recover and resume operations within the required time frames, making it a costly and an extended outage. As a result, we were contracted to provide cloud-based disaster recovery and cloud-based infrastructure to allow them to move from legacy hardware to running all of their critical applications on our fully managed, highly secure enterprise cloud with dedicated support teams, ensuring seamless and rapid recovery.Furthermore, we secured a multi-million-dollar project with one of the nation's leading sports and entertainment companies. For this project, we built a custom solution and are providing cloud storage infrastructure to improve response times to files, recovery of files, and increasing their storage capacity.We believe this contract demonstrates our ability to address each client's needs and build that specific solutions to assist in reaching their goals. In addition, the sports and entertainment industry has been increasing the adoption of data storage and security solutions. As a result, we are gaining traction in this industry.And most recently, we have a contract to one of the largest food distributors in the United States to provide managed disaster recovery solutions. This is another subscription-based contract and increased our reach within the vertical, while enhancing our recognition within the food industry. We have the opportunity to expand these contracts and provide additional services, which we will explore and execute accordingly.We're securing large high-margin contracts and have been focused on subscription-based services, providing recurring revenue as we add these important companies to the list of 450 companies we currently serve.I'm proud to report that CloudFirst and Flagship achieved profitability on a stand-alone basis for both the first and second quarters. We're targeting large market opportunities and continue to secure contracts and believe we are better positioned to penetrate the market as well as expand our geographic footprint, which should assist in accelerating our growth.We also continue to explore strategic acquisitions that complement and improve our current operations, including companies leading a technology trend or may increase our distribution channels, while they'd add important technical staff and create economies of scale. Through all these initiatives I've highlighted, I am confident we can continue to grow revenue, improve our gross profit margins and net income.To wrap up, as mentioned, at the start of the call, we're effectively executing on our business initiatives and achieved profitability for the second quarter. At the same time, we maintained a solid balance sheet with over $10.6 million in cash and short-term investments and intend to deploy capital efficiently to assist in the growth of the company, while continuing to secure meaningful contracts. We believe our growth strategy will support long-term profitability and create long-term value for our shareholders.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris Panagiotakos, our CFO, to discuss the second quarter financials. Please go ahead, Chris.Chris PanagiotakosThank you, Chuck. Total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $5.9 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 22% compared to $4.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is attributed to an increase in all of our revenue streams during the current period.Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $3.3 million, an increase of $56,000 or 2% compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was mostly related to an increase in equipment related cost of sales.Selling and general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023, were $2.5 million, a decrease of $122,000 or 5% as compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in salary expenses, a reduction in advertising expenses, offset by an increase in professional fees and commission expenses.Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $530,000 compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $259,000 for the same period last year. Net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $227,000 compared to a net loss of $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022.We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $10.7 million at June 30, 2023, compared to $11.3 million at December 31, 2022. Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Chuck.Chuck PilusoThanks, Chris. We'd like to open it up for questions if any.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Matthew Galinko, Maxim Group.Matthew GalinkoHey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Can we start with, you know, it just seems like given the last couple of months that the velocity of large deals has been picking up a little bit, am I right to see that pattern? And is there anything specific you could attribute that to in terms of your go-to-market and execution that just, you know, there's an uncertain cadence to when large contracts land or just help me understand how that came to be.Chuck PilusoGood morning, Matt. Let me start off by saying that we've been preaching that the migration is underway for these large, powerful IBM systems. We know that it's plateaued, maybe even decline slightly on Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. And a lot of those systems, Azure, whatever are in play and have in play for 10-plus years.But this migration on the IBM side is happening and it's accelerating. And so companies that are midsize as we know that most of these systems on the IBM side are enterprise level and mid. And so with that, the migration is underway, and that's why when you see 45,000 visitors and that's combined for all three companies, but I believe it's over 38,000 for just CloudFirst alone, could be a little higher than that, but let's just assume around [38,000].So this we can see by the number of visitors to the site, how many times migrating your IBM systems to the cloud has been downloaded off of our site. So there's a very high awareness to it. There's limited competition in this area at this particular point, and we're taking advantage of it, but it's about the migration now, Matt.Matthew GalinkoGot you. That's helpful. I think you touched on a pipeline number. I think it was I think you said $9 million in prepared, but correct me if I'm wrong, I guess is that -- do your pipeline numbers generally include the large multi-million-dollar opportunities that are moving through or you know, that $9 million, like how is that -- what does the competition look like in terms of size?Chuck PilusoSo what happens is Hal Schwartz, President of CloudFirst has -- because he's like a scientist on evaluating at what level that particular proposal is. So everyone puts in, you know if it's 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% on the probability side. So when you see the $9 million, it means that these are individuals, these are companies that have requested or have worked with the technical staff and our sales staff on receiving proposals. So this is total contract value on the $9 million.Now when there's very, very large deals, we really typically don't include that. Now when it moves to a 90%, I believe they're negotiating terms and conditions. So it's fairly scientific. So when we look at $9 million, you could say if the average is 29 months, which is our average contract rate, although most of them are 36 months, you could divide that out and come up with what the monthly recurring revenue is on that. But for the most part, we have folks at 12 months and we have some at 60 months.But -- so it varies, but these are folks that have requested and have worked with our technical team to get our proposal on our services. But if it's a real monster deal, which that happens sometimes because Flagship works on some very large equipment type deals. We typically do pull that and we don't put that in there or we reduce it down to a 5% or 10%.So we're fairly between Tom Kempster who's -- runs the CEO, President of Flagship. They're pretty -- I'll use the word, not just conservative, but very scientific at what stage the discussions take place with the client and the client's technical team and our technical team.So in answer to the question, $9 million in proposal is outstanding. When it moves to 90%, you know, Hal has those numbers, and we basically know for the rest of '23 and the beginning of '24 what that recurring revenue will be in addition to they move out of these proposal and it goes into work in process, which we're not reporting at all right now. I don't think we have, Chris, right?Chris PanagiotakosNo.Chuck PilusoWe haven't reported that. I think that I believe we have around $160,000 not pending but being installed right now on the recurring revenue side alone that, you know, I believe that's the number. So that will be added in over the next few months. But it's a continual process. I don't know if that helps at all. But we're pretty conservative in the way we do it.Matthew GalinkoNo, that's very helpful. I guess maybe the last one for me at the moment. So I think your SG&amp;A line tends to bump around a fair bit. But how big, I guess how would you categorize or frame your spending on go-to-market, you know, through the balance of the year, just given the momentum you seem to have year to date?Chuck PilusoI think when you're looking at the SG&amp;A, sometimes when there's equipment sales just before we go into the marketing piece of it, with the equipment sales, you'll get large commissions on it. The percentage of the gross profit is paid to the sales rep on equipment. And so you'll see that type of bump on there. But you also have stock compensation that is sitting in the SG&amp;A as well, which we get hit with on the stock options and stock grants.So that's the other reason why you might see a bump like that, I believe it was over $400,000 for Flagship in 2022; and in 2023, $52,000. So we gave the executives there at the time at Flagship stock compensation because they didn't achieve what was intended to at Flagship based on performance and we wanted them to be able to be part of the company. So that's why you'll see that bump in stock compensation. I believe it was approximately $460,000 for Flagship in 2022.Matthew GalinkoGot it. All right. Thank you. I'll jump back in the queue.Operator(Operator Instructions) Adam Waldo, Lismore Partners.Adam WaldoGood day, everyone. Chuck, thanks very much for taking my questions, again this quarter. I want to really drill down again on the new business pipeline and backlog metrics, which certainly as we met last quarter and when you reported fourth quarter results back in the winter, we're illustrating what you qualitatively termed a migration acceleration right in customers to the IBM platform.So when we met last quarter, you reported 19,000 inbound inquiries over the three divisions' websites year to date and that compared with 6,000 back in the winter. Now, today you're reporting 45,000. So I think that really puts a fine point on it, right? How do we think about how those kinds of inbound inquiries compare with a year ago, keeping in mind that you have also been upgrading your websites this year relative to last?Chuck PilusoGood morning, Adam. Let me try to separate the questions. On the new business, the pipeline, and this migration, I just wanted to say that on the migration, it's not that people are moving to IBM, although the platform is increasing by, I believe, 9% over the previous period.So people are moving there, but it's not -- it's the folks that have these systems installed already that are seeing that it might be better to preserve capital and to have the pay-as-you-grow kind of concept and build it up for the latest and greatest systems and get the best disaster recovery.So it's not that they're moving to IBM Power, although there is some growth. These are folks that have these systems in there. IBM is typically, I'll use the term culture and they stick with it. On the acceleration with the inquiries, when I mentioned 45,000, that's for all three sites. So if we're comparing because they're accelerating the other two subsidiaries, but let's just talk about CloudFirst.Yes, that was, I believe, around 38,000 year to date today. When I gave that number the last time, I think it was as of the April-May time frame on those numbers. So yes, the increase are coming in. We have a pretty good close rate on it when they're calling in to us. An inbound lead is usually better, something's going on in their environment, whether it's a, you know, the CFO is saying, let's take a look at this. It might be more beneficial to us.Our IBM technicians that are managing the hardware are getting a little older possibly, getting ready to retire. And these custom applications that are sitting there, that have been built on this platform, the developers are still developing that and it could be folks that just graduated from college but the folks that are actually maintaining this hardware, that is an exposure for these companies.And so with that, they're investigating. And that's why that nurture list is very large. And we continue and they don't opt out either. So it's pretty interesting that we continue to send information, increase come in. So this migration is, number one, underway. Our pipeline, we're starting to close them. It's not just proposals sitting in a pipeline and just sitting there for years.So I would say that we have a good close rate. Migration is underway. Our pipeline is $9 million. That pipeline was higher, but we closed some of those deals and that's why it's reduced from what it was before. But it's underway. And I think we're going to take advantage of that.And if we can look to utilize some of the cash we have in the bank for some additional growth in potentially the UK that we're looking at and also expanding Canada with the two data centers we have there with our partners in Canada. So we expect to grow the pipeline and the migration is happening and there's limited competition. So, Adam, we're kind of excited about it, frankly.In the case of just to go back to Flagship for a moment, the cross-selling is finally working. Deals are coming in from Flagship and they have I'm going to save 25 very large recognizable accounts that are looking at these cloud-based solutions that provided through CloudFirst.At the same time, they're doing a great job with selling equipment and provisioning. So yeah, I'm excited. I think it's good. More excited than previously, although, you know, I'm never satisfied as a personality disorder, but I would say that it's moving. And you take a look at that EBITDA on CloudFirst, it's good. And I believe that Tom Kempster is moving up those gross profit margins because they're visiting the accounts and improving the margins on those accounts. I don't know if that answered your question fully.Adam WaldoNo, that's very helpful color, Chuck. I appreciate it, and very encouraging. You know, as you look at sales cycles and close rates, are those remaining pretty stable or is the large increase in inbound inquiries affecting sales cycle lengths and close rates in any meaningful way?Chuck PilusoI tell you what I think we're doing a good job with the great job and what we need to do more of, frankly, because on the inbound lead side, it is moving. Actually, Flagship is moving up now. There's been some changes to the website, but the inbound lead side is going great. We have to do more with our indirect, with the alternate channels, with channel partners, and looking for typically in the past, we always look for the companies that sold these IBM systems.And as you look at that eventually, it gets a little tired. And there's a lot of other revenue we believe that's out there that the fiber is already in the ground. Think about cable companies and telecom companies that are looking to increase the revenue per customer where they have the relationships. So we have to look at more non-traditional type of channel partners.I'm not saying we're doing a poor job there, don't misunderstand me. We do a good job there, but I think we could do more and we need to expand the support that the team that focuses on channel partners. We need to be able to expand that. But there's way -- when you bring it -- when you have a channel partner that has sold the customer already, it's an easier sale.First is you're not knocking on doors anymore or making phone calls. So inbound leads, networking, and going after the folks that have these customers that are trusted advisers or that have the customer base. Look at the cable companies, they're just getting crushed, but they do have the network. So it's things like that, that we're also looking at.Adam WaldoRight. And as you prioritize, Chuck, I mean, midpoint, obviously, that trusted partners as channel partners obviously accelerate the sales cycle and close rates relative to sort of -- as you compare that to international expansion, right, where you'd be going more de novo or maybe plan to go internationally with channel partners. Maybe you could just flesh that out for us a little bit more.As you think about the UK and Canada, would that be with channel partners or would that be de novo? And how are you prioritizing the relative capital efficiency of channel partners and the returns on that versus potential international expansion if it will be de novo?Chuck PilusoYeah. Just a little background on me for just 30 seconds. I did this with International Telecommunications Corporation and we had switches globally and partners globally. And we did it through partners. That company went public after we were rolled all together for [$800 million]. So I've been around internationally before. And the best way of doing it is doing it with partners, you can accelerate faster.We have the cash to be able to support those partners, which is key because a lot of these companies really do not have the cash. So being able to pick up channel partners in the UK, we already have that in Canada. But to be able to pick them up in the UK and work with them and then put the equipment under the way we build it.Chuck Paolillo, our CTO and the way that he builds it and his team basically, we can roll out to UK very fast. But we want to do that with channel partners. Doesn't mean we won't have sales reps, or country manager, and technicians. But they'd be geared to support the partners that we try to bring into agreements in the same way that happens here in the United States under Steve Romweber, Director of our Channel and [Chris Nasin] and the team and all. So we're going to do it with partners.Adam WaldoOkay, that's terrific. One last one if you'll quickly permit me. Last quarter, Chris and you acquired $5.5 million executed contracts that the service delivery team was in the process of installing and implementing. How does that look here at the end of the latest quarter?Chris PanagiotakosWell, I don't really want to give guidance on it. And I really can't give a timing on it. But it's okay, I want to answer the question. What happens a lot of times when you're putting up infrastructure-as-a-service, you have to work closely with the client's technical team.So even though our folks might be ready to go, their folks might be ready to go, but it's not such a fast process on the infrastructure side. So I really couldn't give the timing on that. I could tell you right now that approximately, I believe $160,000 in monthly recurring revenue is in the process of being installed. But I can't give you a timing on what month that might hit or what quarter because it could be client delays, their priorities, and all, but these are executed contracts.Adam WaldoRight. Okay. And so about $160,000 in process and about 29, 30 months' average length or is it a little longer than that than the historical averages?Chris PanagiotakosYeah. I mean, some could be 12 months, some could be 60, you know, in that range. I really don't have top of my head, but it does range in that area. But the way -- the average is 29 months on that. But yeah, the timing is tough to be able to give that.And if we knew exactly, I would give guidance on it, it will be the first time we gave guidance. But sometimes we expect something to happen in a month and it goes up. And then all of a sudden something goes on the networking side or it's delayed because of their projects that are going on the client side. So it's tough to actually predict that, but these are executed agreements.Adam WaldoOkay. Thanks very much.OperatorThank you. There are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor over to management for closing remarks.Chuck PilusoMatt and Adam, thank you for the questions. Overall, we're beginning to witness the benefits of the business initiatives and anticipate realizing the full benefits over time. As we roll out initiatives, we believe we can achieve sustained profitability and increase value for our shareholders. We're very excited about the outlook for the business and look forward to announcing additional milestones in the near term. I'd like to thank everyone who joined today, we appreciate it; and have a great day.OperatorThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.]"

This reflects the market's appreciation for management's effective expense-control measures earlier this year and the more signs of stabilization in the digital ad market. Meta continues to benefit from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Meta Platform is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. The Zacks analyst expects revenues to grow at a CAGR of 12.2% between 2022 and 2025. Advertising revenues are expected to witness a CAGR of 12.5% per our model estimate.However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues, along with targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple’s iOS changes. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Costco Wholesale have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+4.4% vs. +0.6%) on the back of the company's consumer defensive attributes.The discount retailer’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. This outlook reflects Costco’s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.(You can read the full research report on Costco Wholesale here &gt;&gt;&gt;)BlackRock shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past six months (-3.1% vs. -1.7%). Increasing expenses (mainly owing to higher administration costs) are expected to hurt profits to an extent. The Zacks analyst expects total non-interest expenses to increase 2.4% this year. The company’s high dependence on overseas revenues makes us apprehensive.However, BlackRock continues to restructure the equity business, which, along with strategic acquisitions, will likely keep supporting revenue growth, and help expand market share and footprints globally.A solid AUM balance is expected to further support the top line.

The performance mainly reflected strong growth in Twisted Tea, offset by continuing challenges in the hard seltzer category.In the second quarter, Boston Beer witnessed improvements in financial performance and volume, bolstered by the timely occurrence of the 4th of July holiday. This positive outcome is a result of the consistent execution of operational plans.Shares of Boston Beer have rallied 8.9% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s rise of 1.7%. Meanwhile, the sector has declined 2.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s earnings suggests growth of 6.7% from the year-ago period’s reported number.Factors to Drive GrowthSAM's focus on innovation to revive the Truly brand and expand Twisted Tea’s potential bodes well. Boston Beer is keen on bringing excitement to the Truly brand’s core flavors through innovation. The company's Truly flavored bottle Vodka and Truly Vodka Seltzer have been performing well. With regard to revisiting the core flavors, the company announced the reformulation and improvement of core Truly flavors, including the addition of real fruit juice for an even smoother, easy-to-drink and refreshing taste.Coming to Twisted Tea, the brand drove most of the improvements of Boston Beer in the second quarter. Effective brand-building campaigns, increased investment in media and additional retail programs focused on the Super Bowl, better distribution of 12 packs and improved service levels have been aiding the performance of the brand. Its growing brand awareness and household penetration also bode well. The company further expanded its light portfolio offerings with a new variety pack available in select highly developed markets, which has received positive feedback from customers.We note that Boston Beer has made successful innovations in craft beer, and hard cider and iced tea categories over the years. The company is on track with growth of its Beyond Beer category, wherein it currently holds the 2nd position. Beyond Beer is growing faster than the traditional beer market. It expects the trend to continue for the next several years.The company is also focused on accelerated cost savings and efficiency projects to aid margins. In the second quarter, its gross margin primarily benefited from strong price realization and procurement savings, which more than offset increased inflationary costs. Also, advertising, promotional and selling expenses declined 3.6% in the reported quarter due to lower freight to distributors on reduced rates and volumes.For 2023, management envisions GAAP earnings per share of $6.00-$10.00 for 2023, whereas it reported $5.44 in the prior year.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeBoston Beer has been witnessing a slowdown in the hard seltzer category and the demand for the Truly brand in recent quarters. The slowing hard seltzer trends hurt the company’s depletions to some extent in second-quarter 2023. The hard seltzer category’s decelerating trend has mainly been attributed to the loss of novelty among consumers due to the entry of several beyond-beer products in the marketplace. Additionally, the decline has resulted from the ongoing dismal macroeconomic environment, which has caused a volume shift from hard seltzers back to premium light beers due to their lower pricing.For 2023, the company expects overall volumes to decline due to continued weakness in Truly volume, which is expected to partly offset strong growth in Twisted Tea. Depletions and shipments are expected to decline 2-8% in 2023. This view includes the adverse impact of 1% due to an additional 53rd week in 2022, while 2023 will have 52 weeks. On a 52-week comparable basis, the company expects depletions and shipments to decline 1-7%.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, Molson Coors TAP and PepsiCo Inc.

F, General Motors Co. GM, NOV Inc NOV, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and PagSeguro Digital Ltd. PAGS.5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Buy in AugustWhile there are a host of valuation metrics, the first to cross one's mind is the price-to-earnings ratio. However, in the case of loss-making companies, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is negative. In such a scenario, price-to-sales (P/S) could indicate the hidden strength of the business.The price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of the book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., NOV Inc, StoneCo Ltd. and PagSeguro Digital Ltd. are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.Understanding Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Dearborn, MI-based Ford Motor is one of the leading automakers in the world.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down the UAW's demands and the potential impact of the new contract on the auto industry.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Contract negotiations between the big 3 auto companies-- General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis-- and the union group, United Auto Workers, continue to flail, pointing to a greater likelihood of a strike within the next month. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian to discuss the latest developments. Hey, Pras.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Rachelle. The UAW leader Shawn Fain striking a combative tone as negotiations roll on. A few weeks back, Fain outlined some of these demands publicly, which is usually not how things are done, kind of saying that they want to fight. So what do they exactly want? Among other things, they want substantial wage increases, ending the compensation tiers between older and younger workers, cost-of-living adjustments, and defined pension plan, to name a few.Now, I spoke to a Detroit industry source who was alarmed by some of these demands. The source tells Yahoo Finance, quote, ""Everyone understands these demands aren't going to happen-- it would be suicidal for these companies to agree to this."" ""The 10 demands add up to $25 billion to $30 billion per automaker over the life of the contract."" And finally, ""The impact would be crippling, returning automakers to the bankruptcy era of 2008.""So for its part, the UAW responds to these things and says, studies show that labor accounts for only 5% of the cost of making a car, and the biggest drivers for car prices for consumers is actually dealer markups. Bottom line, both sides look like they aren't going to back down, meaning a work stoppage, Rachelle, is looking more and more likely.]"

On Thursday, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) postponed the launch of the all-electric Ford Explorer from the initially planned early 2024 to the summer of 2024. Also on Thursday, General Motors (NYSE: GM) revealed it is still having issues on the Ultium battery front which are slowing down its EV production. Meanwhile, EV king Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) just revealed today it has again cut prices in China, making it even harder for others to catch up.Ford Is Facing EV SetbacksThe EV that will debut on the European market next summer will be built on a platform of Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) in Germany. Ford already revealed its EV segment is slated for a loss of $4.5 billion this year which is $1.5 billion more than initially expected. Ford CFO John Lawler also did not provide an exact date for the 2 million EV annual output that was previously targeted for 2026.General Motors Is Also Having EV StrugglesReuters reported that GM CFO Paul Jacobson stated on an investor conference that the company’s EV output has been slowed down due to production issues of its new Ultium battery packs that the automaker is co-producing with LG Energy Solution Ltd. Upon the warning battery news, GM shares tanked almost 6% on Thursday to their lowest level in more than two months. From January to June, GM manufactured only 50,000 EVs and the majority of them used the older battery pack. GM already missed its production targets last year. The most recent battery setback will mostly impact the production of the Cadillac Lyriq.Tesla Cuts Prices In China, Yet AgainJust as price tensions started showing signs of abating, Tesla has once again struck by rekindling the price war. According to a post on its Weibo account, Tesla has lowered the prices of the Long Range and Performance versions of the Model Y by about $1,900. It seems that price competitiveness remains an ongoing theme in the Chinese EV universe. Upon news, Tesla stock dropped 1.7% in early US trading, while the stock of its greatest rival in China, the country’s best-selling automaker BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) tanked as much as 8.7% in Hong Kong. Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ: LI) and Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) also slumped. This move is Tesla reacting upon its July report that showed a slowdown in orders due to the lack of new models to attract buyers with the shipments from its China facility tanking 31% to the lowest level this year. Tesla announced to be making the revamped version of the Model 3 sedan at the facility, but it did not offer any specifics. Meanwhile, BYD, Li Auto and Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) have set new records on the shipment front in July. Early last month, Tesla and BYD, among others, pledged to maintain fair competition and therefore, stay away from abnormal pricing in the country, but the agreement was retracted only days later due to antitrust concerns.Story continuesAll in all, it seems that has the weapon that Tesla used, the price cuts, did its job of crushing its EV competitors.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

An upsurge in passenger volumes makes the AAL stock an attractive investment opportunity currently.Let’s delve deep to unearth the factors working in favor of the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Northward Earnings Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings has been revised 7.2% and 15.8% upward over the past 60 days, respectively. Such favorable estimate revisions reflect brokers’ confidence in the stock.Given the wealth of information at the brokers’ disposal, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by their expert advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because it serves as a key indicator in determining the price of a stock.Buoyant Air-Travel Demand: Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, is aiding American Airlines. Passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of the top line, have been very strong. Recently, management lifted earnings per share forecast for 2023, primarily driven by the rosy scenario.The company now expects 2023 earnings (on an adjusted basis) in the band of $3-$3.75 per share (earlier view: $2.5-$3.5 per share). Adjusted operating margin is now anticipated to be between 7% and 9% (prior guidance:11-13%). With air-travel demand having improved, American Airlines is constantly looking to add routes and broaden network.Impressive Price Performance: Driven by the rosy air-travel-demand scenario, shares of AAL have gained 23% year to date compared with its industry’s growth of 19%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBullish Industry Rank: The industry, to which AAL belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 55 (of 250 plus groups). Such a solid rank places AAL in the top 22% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group that it hails from.Story continuesIn fact, an ordinary stock in a strong group is likely to outperform a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, taking the industry’s performance into consideration becomes imperative.Other Key PicksInvestors interested in the Zacks Airline industry may also consider stocks like United Airlines UAL and Delta Air Lines DAL. While UAL sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), DAL carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand.

(NYSE:PNC) share price up 14% in a single quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last year have been less than pleasing. After all, the share price is down 27% in the last year, significantly under-performing the market.With the stock having lost 3.9% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. View our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Even though the PNC Financial Services Group share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.We don't see any weakness in the PNC Financial Services Group's dividend so the steady payout can't really explain the share price drop. The revenue trend doesn't seem to explain why the share price is down. Of course, it could simply be that it simply fell short of the market consensus expectations.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for PNC Financial Services Group in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of PNC Financial Services Group, it has a TSR of -24% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in PNC Financial Services Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 24% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 4.1%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 0.9%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with PNC Financial Services Group .PNC Financial Services Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.

RapidRatings Executive Chairman James Gellert and Unity Marketing President-Founder Pamela Danziger joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the state of the retail industry right now. Gellert says smaller, private retailers are being ""much more squeezed"" than their larger counterparts.Danziger, meanwhile, says ""the biggest question right now for retailers is consumer spending."" Danziger points to a recent report from the National Retail Federation that warns consumer spending is slowing and that ""we're really looking at, I think, a very potentially contracted environment for retailers coming up in the last half of the year.""Click here to see more from the Yahoo Finance series ""Retail Evolution: The New Era.""Video Transcript- Number of the big box retailers will be releasing earnings giving investors a chance to see how the sector has fared. Now, it's no surprise that retailers have been given the amount of attention that it has with a myriad of challenges, including inflation, wage growth, and supply chains.Now, data from Epiq Bankruptcy shows all is still not rosy. The number of commercial chapter 11 filings registered in July increased 71%. Overall, commercial filings increased 21% in the same period. And small business filings increased 61% to 153 in July. Now, that's up from 95 in July of 2022. The total number of bankruptcy filings topped 35,000, indicating the economic recovery is still uneven.Let's bring in now RapidRatings Executive Chairman, James Gellert, as well as Unity Marketing Founder and President, Pamela Danziger, to discuss this more. Big welcome to you both here. So James, I want to start with you here because as we talk about the metrics that you use in your ratings here, who are you seeing as the big winners and losers so far?JAMES GELLERT: So good to be with you and Pamela, you as well. You just put up some very sobering statistics, and I think it frames out the conversation really well. We have a significant increase in bankruptcies and defaults but we have moreover, a ton of pressure on a lot of industries, retail being one of them. We look at financial statements of public and private companies to evaluate the financial health and core health, which is a longer term measure of businesses.Story continuesAnd what we have found since the end of 2021 is that retail is our second most declining sector. It is of 28 sectors the lowest that we have rated at the moment at a 61 on our 100 point scale, which compares to all of our coverage for public companies of a 55. So it's slightly better, but it is down 6.7 points since the end of 21.Really, the big issue here, two big issues. One, private companies in the sector. Smaller companies, mid-sized businesses and retail are being much more squeezed than their public counterparties, and the leveraged position of companies is going to be the big story over the next six months but really, the next probably 24.- And Pam, as we look at the landscape as a whole, obviously, you have interest rates. Incredibly tough if you're trying to refinance as a business. What are some of the retailers, when you look at that landscape, what are they telling you are their biggest issues?PAMELA DANZIGER: Well, I think one of the biggest question right now for retailers is consumer spending. And when NRF just came out and announced that consumer spending is slowing, that is something that everybody should take notice of because just a month ago, they were saying that they had revised data that showed that there was underlying strength in the economy that was going to roll forward.But right now, they're seeing something in their signals and their signs that say spending is down, and that's going to put back-to-school shopping at risk. And back-to-school shopping is a bellwether of what's ahead for Christmas and holiday shopping. So we're really looking at a really, I think, a very potentially contracted environment for retailers coming up the last half of the year.- And James, when you look at some of the rising debt levels for these retailers here, are there certain companies that are managing this debt better than others, especially when you look at this spike that we're seeing in bankruptcies?JAMES GELLERT: Well, you've got the largest companies in the space, the Walmarts of the world, Target. Walmart rated at 68, Target rated at 63. These are strong ratings in the grand scheme of things. And they will continue to have access to the capital markets perhaps with slight variations on funding costs. But it's again, the smaller companies and to Pamela's point, the ones that are more susceptible and exposed to some of the vagaries of maybe consumer spending habits for non-discretionary or rather for discretionary items.So you look at the companies like a Wayfair, for instance, with an FHR of 20 and overstock has dropped recently to a 41. These are companies that have been able to manage their debt reasonably well by kicking the can down the road and refinancing. But as their maturities begin to come due, they will certainly have more pressure on them.And for contrast, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond when it filed for bankruptcy was rated at 25. Tuesday morning at 25, Party City in 18. So companies in the 40 and below range are in the highest risk of failing historically, and those are the ones that we're seeing continue to flash a lot of red lights.- And Pam, as you look at this issue of what we're seeing with a potential recession coming down the road, you also have student loan debt repayments about to kick in. So that's even less discretionary income as well. When you look at that outcome there, when you look at the bigger companies versus the value plays, what sort of environment should we be looking at timeline-wise?PAMELA DANZIGER: Well, that's a question that nobody has an answer for, but I think we're seeing increasingly 2024 is going to be tough. And again, if the retailer-- if consumers pull back as I expect them to-- and we talk about credit. The consumer credit cards are maxed out now. They owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt, so that's taking a bigger chunk of their discretionary spending out.So I think we're looking at an environment next year that whether or not we have a recession, I think we're going to be in a place of stagflation, like remember back from the 70s, with smaller retailers more at risk from declining consumer spending.- And James, when you look at how much the consumer has changed, obviously, a lot of these companies are trying to get a handle on what the consumer wants. We saw the backlog when it came with inventory. What do you think is going to be the next catalyst for retailers as you give an outlook?JAMES GELLERT: The story for the last couple of years has been supply chain. The story for the next couple of years will continue to be supply chain. Now, the companies that have the greatest access to supply ahead and are able to plan for consumer spending changes over the coming quarters are really the ones that are going to be best positioned. The ones that have less resilient supply chains, don't have as much insight into the goods that they're buying or have suffered disruptions of one kind or another, they're the ones that are going to have a trickier time managing consumer preferences.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond again is a great example of a company that really lost the confidence of its suppliers as it was facing a lot of its problems. And then of course, lost the confidence of its consumers as they would show up to stores and not see the goods on the shelves that they wanted.But as you go upstream in supply chains, you have smaller and smaller and more often private companies that are highly exposed to the rising interest rate environments and floating rate debt because they tend to be more bank borrowers than they are long-term bond issuers. So in their cases, the cost of capital have increased on top of the costs of labor and the costs of goods. So they're the ones who are more impinged, and they can't necessarily pass those costs through to their ultimate customers or the larger retailers that they're selling to. Those are the ones that are really going to be at the most risk over the next 24 months.- So Pam, until we see interest rates start to come down and consumers feel more comfortable here, is anything else really going to change this situation? What is a new normal going to look like after being so comfortable with historically low interest rates for so long and now these bankruptcies continuing to pile up?PAMELA DANZIGER: Yeah, well, I think the word-- and I remember the '70s, I think the word is going to be kind of a stagflation. People are going to put off buying discretionary products and making discretionary purchases. I mean, already, LVMH, Kering, Richemont, Prada, and Burberry already saw reduced spending in the US on luxury goods. And luxury is the most discretionary of purchases, and it's the one that is most easily put off. So I see them-- I see luxury is also threatened and in a bad place right now from what's happening with consumers.- And James, that's interesting because we know that for at least most of the post-pandemic, luxury spending was pretty resilient here. As you look at perhaps some of these luxury retailers versus the value plays, who do you see then as perhaps coming out on top? As we are starting to see some of those cracks in the luxury spending market.JAMES GELLERT: Well so, I think the winners here are-- luxury has a place and will continue to have a reasonably well-supported customer group. But it will vary from quarter to quarter as Pamela has just rightly pointed out.But a big issue I think we will see going forward is acquisition and event risk among these names. So we're already beginning to see some consolidation in the industry. I believe we will see more of that. And there's a whole world of private capital, both private equity and private credit that has a lot of dry powder and has been a bit on the sidelines more than at least over the last 10 years over this past year. And this past year, the dry powder just continues to build up.So more private equity firms are going to get into the space and beginning to look to crank up some of the brands that may be strong brands historically but running into a little bit of a challenge from a financial perspective today. And we'll see a lot more of that coming up for the balance of this year and in '24.- I do appreciate you both joining us this morning here. A big thank you there to RapidRatings Executive Chairman, James Gellert, as well as Unity Marketing Founder and President, Pamela Danziger. Thank you both.]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $25,556 million, indicating a decrease of about 1.9% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this general merchandise retailer is anticipated to have increased year over year. Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter under review has declined by a couple of cents to $1.48 over the past seven days, it suggests a sharp increase from earnings of 39 cents reported in the year-ago period.Target has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 4.9%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Minneapolis, MN-based company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.8%.Key Things to NoteConsumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown signs of slowing down. Several factors have come into play, including underlying inflationary pressure, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings. Target might have witnessed soft demand for discretionary products, partly offset by sustained strength in essentials.Based on soft first-quarter sales trends, Target guided a low-single-digit-decline in comparable sales for the second quarter. We projected a comparable sales decline of 2.1% for the quarter under discussion.Besides, management guided greater SG&amp;A rate pressure in the second quarter. As a result, the operating margin rate is likely to decrease on a sequential basis. We anticipate a 120-basis points decline in the operating margin on a sequential basis. However, on a year-over-year basis, we estimate a 280-basis points improvement in the operating margin.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Target Corporation QuoteAs a result, the bottom line is expected to showcase year-over-year growth. For the second quarter, the company guided adjusted earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.70 per share, up sharply from 39 cents reported in the year-ago period.Markedly, management has been undertaking cost-control measures, such as working with vendors and driving continued operational efficiencies.

By comparison, the Dow is only up 9% on the year and rival Target (TGT) has plunged 13% on a stretch of sales and earnings whiffs.At a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 24.5 times, Walmart stock is trading at a slight premium to its historical average of 21.9 times.The bull case for Walmart stockThe Walmart bull trade has worked so well primarily because the discounter is seen as a market share winner into 2024.A new survey of consumers from investment bank Stifel on Monday showed Walmart has the ""highest shopping intentions"" relative to peers. Moreover, Stifel's work found Walmart is ""retaining higher income shoppers earnings more than $100,000 a year.""A total of 71% of households earning more than $100,000 a year have shopped at Walmart in 2023 year to date compared to 50% at Target and 31% at Costco (COST).""Our consumer survey remains most favorable for shares of Costco and Walmart viewing each as best-positioned to maintain share gains in an increasingly competitive US spending environment,"" said the survey's lead analyst Mark Astrachan.""For Walmart shares, we continue to see more upside than downside from current levels,"" Astrachan added.Astrachan's $167 price target on Walmart assumes about a 4% upside to the stock from current levels.Others on the Street are even more bullish on Walmart, and for reasons beyond the company capturing more dollars from cash-strapped households.""We would also note two sizable opportunities ahead for Walmart, including its fast-growing media business as the company aspires to become the top 10 advertiser in the US, as well as its continued push into healthcare amplified by the recent end of partnership with National Vision,"" Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul pointed out in a note Monday.Story continuesDrbul said there is ""substantial value creation potential"" from ""alternative revenue streams"" such as advertising, fulfillment services, financial services, and healthcare.Walmart logo at the entrance to the retailer's store on Nov. 30, 2021, in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. (Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)The longtime retail analyst also thinks Walmart's stakes in Walmex (Walmart Mexico), Flipkart, PhonePe, JD.com, and Dada Nexus aren't being properly valued by the market.Drbul estimated these businesses alone are worth a total of $155 billion at present. Walmart has $93 billion invested in the businesses, with its largest stakes in Flipkart (84%) and PhonePe (84%).Drbul determined Walmart's stock is worth $180, roughly 12% higher than current levels.""We believe its position of strength is enabling Walmart to accelerate investments in its infrastructure and should allow full optimization of its strategy, in turn accelerating Walmart's top line and profit growth rates in the mid- to long term,"" Drbul said. ""Walmart is building a more diversified profit base, led by a growing marketplace and fulfillment services, advertising, financial services, data monetization, and its healthcare offering.""But despite the bull case on Walmart, one shouldn't overlook the fact the retailer must deliver exceptional results in the here and now.Anything less may lead to Walmart's stock getting marked down like an out-of-season bathing suit.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

202,741d421a-09d3-3c4a-a705-d5bbb1e15ef1,TGT,2023-08-15,What retail earnings could tell the Fed about inflation,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/retail-earnings-could-tell-fed-134554317.html,1692020754,VIDEO,"['WMT', 'HD', 'TGT']","[A slew of retailers will report their quarterly results this week, including Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and Target (TGT). eToro USA Investment Analyst Callie Cox and J.P. Morgan Global Wealth Management Investment Strategist Elyse Ausenbaugh joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what these results could tell the Federal Reserve about the consumer and inflation. Ausenbaugh notes that consumer are starting to shift their spending from services back to goods, saying it will be ""an interesting dynamic to watch, both in respect to company earnings but also the inflation picture.""As for the Fed, Cox says ""a September rate hike is definitely in play,"" but that ""the data we've seen might keep the Fed higher for longer, longer than investors expect."" However, Cox also notes that at its last meeting, the Fed said it would consider loosening its policy back to the neutral rate, if inflation falls enough. Ausenbaugh says that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell ""has been emphasizing that, at this point, the real fed funds rate is in restrictive territory."" ""Inflation keeps coming down, that's going to continue to get more restrictive and it's the basis for why we think the Fed is actually probably done hiking rates at this point,"" Ausenbaugh said.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: And when we think about so much of the retail data that's set to come forward this week, give us a little bit more glimpse of the consumer right now, a lot of us are going to be watching for what companies are guiding in this larger environment and where the spending propensity of consumers is still continuing to move forward. What are you expecting to hear over the course of this week about the health of the consumer?ELYSE AUSENBAUGH: Look, I think at the headline-level, we are expecting to hear that the consumer still remains really strong. Their balance sheets have remained pretty insulated, even from interest rate increases, given that so many folks were able to lock in cheap financing during the pandemic era. But one thing we are noticing is a shift in the composition of that spending. We're starting to see more momentum move back towards the goods sector, which I think will be an interesting dynamic to watch, both in respect to company earnings but also the inflation picture.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: What's also interesting about the retailers, when they report, their timing is a little bit different than the earnings reports that we've gotten thus far. So did anything change in that consumer-spending picture, given that another month added on, I guess, to the quarter?CALLIE FOX: Yeah, they make us wait a little. But at the same time, we're talking about the second quarter here, and that's when consumer data really started to pick up. So I'm not sure if that's going to change much. It might change management guidance a little bit, Julie. But at the same time, I'm expecting those estimates coming in very low, I'm expecting those earnings to possibly hurdle those estimates, just because we underestimated the consumer so much in the second quarter.BRAD SMITH: You put all of this together and bring it back to the Fed, too, and what their action has been thus far in trying to maintain that, consumers, even though they're continuing to spend right now, of course, there's a larger concern about where some of their policy has actually taken effect, too. And if there's anything that the Fed can pull out of this week, maybe it's not listening to, at least the same way that we do, some of the company earnings reports, but also, the retail sales data that's coming out, as well. Is there any kind of movement that you expect them to make in policy over the next couple of meetings here at this point?CALLIE FOX: Well, I think a September rate-hike is definitely in play. But you have to kind of step back and think about the fact that rates are at 5% already. So does a 25 basis point rate hike really move the needle? Maybe not much, but it's something.I think the data we've seen might keep the Fed higher for longer, longer than investors expect. But at the last meeting, then again, the Fed talked about, if inflation got low enough, they would consider loosening policy back to the neutral rate, if inflation ended up staying around these levels or possibly going a little bit lower. So I'm not sure what we've seen over the past month or so will really move the needle. And I think the Fed is really happy with the progress in inflation we've seen, especially on the services side.JULIE HYMAN: On the point of what you're talking about with returning to normalization, Goldman Sachs out with the note this morning, saying they do expect some cuts, possibly next year, as we see inflation move down below 3%. And the Fed says, OK, we're too restrictive. Is that the scenario you guys are looking at also?ELYSE AUSENBAUGH: Directionally, it is. You brought up the neutral rate, and Powell has been emphasizing that, at this point, the real Fed funds rate is in restrictive territory. Inflation keeps coming down. That's going to continue to get more restrictive, and it's the basis for why we think the Fed is actually probably done hiking rates at this point. First half of next year, we do see a scenario where the Fed could start cutting back to neutral, particularly because this potential for a soft landing scenario is, once again, back on the table. And obviously, Powell would love to pull that off, if he's able to.BRAD SMITH: What would need to happen for them to cut? Because we've been talking to this point about the possibility of a cut, meaning that there was also something more dire that they did see in the economy that's starting to show up. So what would show up by then that's not present right now?ELYSE AUSENBAUGH: Look, if you pick apart the inflation report that we just got last week, notice that there are still some components that are heavily driving that basket of price increases, shelter being a big one. But of course, I do think that this comes back down to the labor market. Powell has been hyper-focused on that super core measure, which is tightly tied to what's going on with wage growth. So to the extent that you see a preservation of some of the favorable labor force participation trends that we've been seeing and a cool down in demand for labor, I think that could provide the ingredients needed for the Fed to get comfortable to start cutting back towards neutral.JULIE HYMAN: All right, let's bring all this back to stocks, because we have seen a-- not quite a rollover, but a meh performance thus far in August.CALLIE FOX: Summer storm.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Are we going to see more of that? Is there anything that's going to forestall the declines that we've been seeing?CALLIE FOX: Well, look, so the economy still looks-- it looks pretty decent at the moment. I think that could limit any sell off we see right now. Plus, there's still a lot of cash on the sidelines.The S&amp;P rises an average of 43% in the first year of bull markets, or at least all the bull markets we've seen since 1950. So there's a lot of momentum driving in the bulls favor. And I think those people sitting on the sidelines, if we see prices move up or stabilize around lower levels, we could to see people start to flow back in.BRAD SMITH: One of the areas, too, that we've been watching, even as we've got some of the logos for those retail Q2 earnings that are set to come out, is just the areas that consumers are still spending in. And if the pullback in spending on furnishings, or apparel, or electronics, if that continues, what does that mean for inventories and all of the different ways that these retailers are going to have to come and communicate to the Street that they're adjusting their own forecasting and that perhaps showing up in guidance, as well?CALLIE FOX: Inventories have been a challenge these past two years. And I'm not sure retailers have quite gotten it right just yet. But according to margin estimates over the next year, consumer discretionaries are up near the top when you look at sector margin growth. So at least the Street thinks that they'll get it together and they could benefit from stabilizing costs. So when you think about the cost side of the equation, I think retailers could stand to benefit a little bit more than the average stock.On the sales side sales, sales are slowing. But I also think, if you're looking at retailers, you need to look at them on a name-by-name basis, because of course, you have a bunch of different flavors. But we have a segment of the economy that's doing a lot better, that's benefited from wage growth, those younger, lower-skilled employers and consumers. So I think that could flow into some interesting names, instead of looking at the sector as a whole.JULIE HYMAN: What about you, Elyse? Do you think that the retail sector is going to be a positive or a negative catalyst, going through the next several weeks?ELYSE AUSENBAUGH: I would say probably a positive catalyst. But I think it's really important right now for investors to not just exclusively focus on the consumer. There's a lot happening in terms of government spending, and also on the corporate side, that could offer some tailwinds.We're bulled up on industrials. We see the potential for tailwinds emanating from the $2.4 trillion worth of infrastructure spending over the next decade to continue to provide some support there, and also tech. I know that the sector looks overvalued right now, but there is a gap in the infrastructure available to actually enable the AI revolution, and we think that has real potential in the coming years.BRAD SMITH: Just, lastly, on this topic, too, because it's continued to come in. Some of the analyst calls around retail specifically, where student loan repayments will start to impact the guidance for these companies that have not already disclosed or talked about it. Do you see that being a big theme that we continue to hear about as we go into some of the larger and the largest retail earnings names set to report this week?ELYSE AUSENBAUGH: I think it certainly could be a theme. This is actually one of the things that we called out in our client note that we published on Friday as one of the dynamics that people aren't talking about enough. That certainly could slow down the consumer, but I don't think it's going to wholesale erode the resilience that we've seen, especially when you've got a labor market that is still working in that consumers favor.]"

Lastly, U.S. Steel (X) turns down a buyout proposal from competitor Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman breaks down several of the morning's top stories.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Big retail steps up to the plate this week, with Walmart, Home Depot and Target all out with results. Stocks have had a tricky time trying to maintain summer gains as investor-confidence shows signs of wavering. The S&amp;P 500 down 2.7% this month, and the NASDAQ composite's first two-week losing streak will also ring some alarm bells for some investors. Elevated bond yields are a part of that story. And along with it, the idea the Fed may not be done with its tightening cycle just yet.US President Joe Biden last week labeled China's economy a ticking time bomb. Investors are treating one big company the same way. Top private developer Country Garden, used to be the country's largest developer, hit a record low after reportedly looking to restructure its debt. The issue will evoke memories of China's Evergrande, which defaulted on its debt two years ago. The bigger picture, the economic data there is weak, with prices in the world's second biggest economy officially in deflation. We'll discuss the read across for corporate America this hour.And it's a critical moment for industry, the steel industry in particular. Shares in US Steel soaring in premarket trading on news it rejected a $7.3 billion buyout proposal from rival Cleveland-Cliffs, and it's exploring strategic alternatives. The domestic steel industry has faced a confluence of headwinds in recent years, from trade wars to rival production and the impact of tariffs. US Steel has long been one of the great symbols of industrialization in the United States. It was founded in 1901 by JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie.]"

(NASDAQ:ISRG), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intuitive Surgical. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intuitive Surgical. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Intuitive Surgical, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intuitive Surgical. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.4% and 5.8% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$516m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Intuitive Surgical. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Intuitive Surgical better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

The dividend yield will be 3.6% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Navient Navient's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, Navient's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 9.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 19% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendNavient Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.50 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 2.5% over that duration. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Navient has grown earnings per share at 23% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.Navient Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Navient (2 are potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

My name is Gigi and I will be coordinating your call today. Following prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions with instructions to be given at that time. I will now hand the call over to Clay Crumbliss with ICR.Clay Crumbliss: Good afternoon and welcome to Westrock Coffee Company’s second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. With us are Mr. Scott Ford, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Chris Pledger, Chief Financial Officer.

The SEC filings, as well as the earnings press release, provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. And with that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Scott Ford, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. Scott?Story continuesScott Ford: Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Thank you, Clay. In a few moments Chris Pledger, our CFO, will review our second quarter financial performance and preview our thinking on the second half of 2023. Calendar year 2023 carries meaningful costs related to major equipment and systems upgrades and additional overhead expense required to prepare us for the next few years. These impacts are largely transitory in nature and best behind us rather than in front of us as we prepare to open our new Conway facility. At each decision point along the way over the past year, we chose securing our success and launching the new extract and RTD plant in Conway over maximizing this year's earnings. But before I turn the call over to Chris for his update, allow me to spend a few minutes updating you on this new Conway facility.As followers of West know, Conway is our single most important and impactful project. It's successful completion and commercial production launch will radically alter the overall profitability and trajectory of the company. Our recent $119 million equity raise provides the funding necessary for the timely completion of the packaging lines originally envisioned and announced; a high speed camera line, a high speed glass bottle line, multi-serve bottle line, and BIB and bulk packaging capabilities. But importantly, this recent raise also funds the installation of a second and third can line and a state-of-the-art product development lab and pilot plant. Today we are pleased to announce that the original can and glass bottle packaging lines are sold out.We have more customer demand than available capacity for our multi-serve line and we've begun discussions with prospective customers who we expect to speak for the available capacity of our two new can lines before they even come online. In addition to this material good news our recent fundraising also enables us to invest in one to three new aseptic or ESL cold chain multi-soft bottle lines, two to three years ahead of our original five year plan assumption. While we're still working out the details of this specific investment, we're confident that we have multiple paths available to us to bring this capability online much sooner than originally foreseen. These new multi-serve bottle lines together with the glass bottle line, three can lines and three aseptic bag-in-box lines will enable us to produce a range of products including ready-to-drink beverages concentrate and our exciting new line of energy products for retail and food service customers as well as our branded CPG customers.So in simple terms, what does this mean to our EBITDA forecast and the timing there for the Conway facility once complete? We previously estimated this plant would be full in 2027 and that once full would generate approximately $100 million in incremental annual EBITDA from the packaging lines previously announced. Due to the developments we are announcing today, we now estimate our once full annual EBITDA run rate will be closer to 125 million to 150 million. Just 12 months ago when we went public, we laid out our intention to build a 500,000 square foot combined manufacturing and distribution facility that would house a collection of dry and extract based coffee packaging equipment and serve as a distribution center. We then updated that plan, given the strong customer demand for our product, by adding a separate standalone 500,000 square foot distribution center as a companion operation to the manufacturing plant and by increasing the RTD lines we would install in the original building.What was simply an idea to fill in industry niche has now been upsized multiple times over with the vast majority of those products, some 70% to 80% of the original and expanded capacity, already spoken for by customers. This is nine months before the first product ever rolls off the line. We are obviously very encouraged by these recent developments. The exponential upsizing of this project over the past year was brought about by customer demand for the types of products this facility will produce and the work of the most extraordinary team I've ever been a part of. Our sales and product development teams have worked tirelessly with customers and in our labs. The engineering production operations and construction crews are on the verge of completing not only one world class, 0.5 million plus square foot facility, but two of them.Our procurement, accounting and support teams have worked non-stop to ensure the raw materials and neural networks are in place and appropriately scaled up before we even turn on the lights. And our core investors and lenders have stepped forward to provide the financial resources required for this rapid escalation. I believe we are on the verge of building a uniquely purposeful and profitable global business and I'm not alone in that assessment. The Westrock Coffee leadership team has been enhanced by the arrival of some of the most seasoned professionals in the beverage creation and production industry. This includes more than a dozen new leaders each with more than 20 years of experience for key roles in project management, plant management, manufacturing, accounting, quality assurance and quality control, and in the engineering, installation and operation of the same equipment we are installing in Conway from major CPGs and product manufacturers such as Pepsi, Dairy Farmers of America, [Indiscernible], Yum!, General Mills, [Indiscernible], etc; just to name a few.The impact this combined business has on millions of smallholder farmers and their families in 35 countries around the world is literally life changing. And our unending thanks goes to our customers who have selected us as their coffee, tea and extract partner and have stayed with us through the challenge of our very rapid scale up; the employee group that delivers on this mission daily, often without recognition or praise; the communities we live and work in which have cheered for us incessantly and extended a helping hand over and over again; and our investors who took a meaningful chance and supported us along this entire journey. All of these people deserve our thanks, our continued candor, and financial success for themselves. Our aim is to deliver just exactly that over the next three to five years.At this point in time, I'll turn the call over to Chris, and let him take you through a review of our current operations and financial results.Pixabay / Public DomainChris Pledger: Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Since this is the first opportunity we have to talk about our recent capital markets activity, I'll begin my remarks by providing some context for both our recent equity raise and credit agreement amendment. After that, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and end with an update on our 2023 outlook. As Scott mentioned, when we went public last August, we did so with a two part strategy; first, we wanted to expand our flavors, extracts and ingredients platform to the build out of our Conway extract and RTD facility and, second, we wanted to expand internationally with our blue chip customer base. Our go-public transaction was designed to provide us with all the capital we needed to jumpstart that plan.As we began 2023, a few things became apparent. First, customer demand for the products we plan to produce out of our Conway facility exceeded our expectations, both in terms of volume and in the variety of formats our customers wanted. Second, this customer demand and the opportunities that presented were growing faster than our ability to access the capital we needed to fund them under the terms of our existing credit facility. And third, the overall US macroeconomic picture with higher inflation, higher interest rates and the turmoil in the banking sector, created uncertainty around expectations for consumer demand and 2023. Collectively, these factors led us to conclude we needed to build a fortress around our balance sheet to ensure we have the capital necessary to fund the expanded opportunities we were seeing out of our Conway extract and RTD facility, and to take advantage of any other opportunities that arose along the way.To accomplish this goal, we look to our lending syndicate to adjust our covenant package, while at the same time we sought to raise 100 million in equity we could use to keep leverage low, even through the now expanded build out of the Conway facility. Despite the macroeconomic environment, we were able to successfully execute on both. First, we have a world-class lending syndicate who worked with us to develop a covenant package better suited for the opportunities we're trying to capitalize on in our Conway facility within the accelerated window in which they were being presented. We then were able to raise approximately 119 million through the sale of common stock at $10 per share, our go-public price. We raised 69 million from two existing Westrock Coffee investors, Haslam family and Brown Brothers Harriman, which we took as a strong vote of confidence in our team, our strategy, and how we have gone about executing that strategy.We also raised 50 million from two new investors who were excited for the opportunity to partner with us as we grow our business. The expansion of our extracts and our RTD business in Conway is the gateway to future EBITDA expansion and remains our top strategic priority and key enabler of future growth. The equity investments and credit agreement amendment form part of a capital plan that ensures the complete build out of the now expanded Conway facility and allows us to remain active as we look for other opportunities to grow the business. Shifting to our second quarter results, total company net sales for the second quarter were 224.7 million compared to 223.4 million for the second quarter of 2022. Consolidated top line momentum was driven by 11% sales growth in beverage solutions, which was partially offset by a 33% decrease in net sales in sustainable sourcing and traceability.Gross profit, excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments, decreased 5.6 million to 34.7 million due to a combination of one-time cost associated with our ERP conversion, one-time cost associated with the rapid scale up of our single-serve platform, and higher coffee and production labor cost in beverage solutions compared to the prior year quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was 11.3 million compared to 13.3 million for the second quarter of 2022. On a segment basis, our beverage solution segment contributed 189.7 million of net sales for the second quarter of 2023, which represents year-over-year growth of 11%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2023 was 11.7 million, compared to 12.5 million for the prior year second quarter.Overall, our beverage solution segment benefited from 51% growth in the sales of flavors, extracts and ingredient products year-over-year and although we did not see the economic benefits of our growth in single-serve volume in our second quarter, we feel confident that the operational improvements are in place to drive improved financial performance from this platform in the back half of the year. Turning to our SS&amp;T segment, sales net of inter-segment revenues were 35 million during the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of 33% compared to the second quarter of 2022, which was driven by lower sales volume as global coffee roasters continue to roast through their buffer stock and we experienced an unfavorable sales mix. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative 400,000 compared to positive 800,000 for the prior year second quarter.With respect to capital expenditures, during the second quarter, we deployed approximately 35 million of CapEx, primarily related to our Conway extract and RTD facility. And at quarter end, we had approximately 120 million of consolidated unrestricted cash and undrawn revolving credit commitments. Our consolidated net leverage ratio at June 30 was 4.9 times based on LTM adjusted EBITDA, but if you take into account the aggregate gross proceeds from our equity raise, which closed earlier this month, our consolidated net leverage ratio at June 30 would have been 2.7 times based on LTM adjusted EBITDA. We believe these investments provide sufficient liquidity to achieve our near-term growth targets and capital expenditure needs. Turning to our outlook for 2023, today, we are reaffirming the guidance we provided in late June for adjusted EBITDA to reflect flat to up 10% growth over 2022.As we look to the back half of 2023, there are several headwinds that are now behind us. The first is our ERP conversion, which collectively cost us $4 million to $5 million in gross profit in the first half of the year. These costs will be out of our run rate for the second half of 2023. Secondly, the operational challenges of scaling up our single-server platform and the related cost, which cost us approximately 4 million in the first half of 2023, are largely behind us. These costs will be out of our run rate in the second half of 2023 as well. In addition, in the back half of 2023, we will benefit from new sales coming online, improved operational efficiencies throughout our manufacturing operation, and pricing improvements, which help offset higher material and labor costs we experienced over the past four quarters.Finally, we expect to see improvement in our SS&amp;T segment, as sales volume and sales mix return to more normal levels. Just a reminder that this guidance is an estimate of what the company believes is realizable, as of the date of this call, and actual results may vary from this guidance, and the variations may be material. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Scott for a few closing remarks.Scott Ford: Thanks, Chris. 14 years ago, we started a small coffee export operation in Rwanda, in order to ensure that farmers in that region received a fair market price for their crop. Many said it couldn't be done. That business ended up creating the world's first fully digitally traceable coffee supply chain, which paved the way for major consumer brands to demand digital price transparency, all the way back to the farmer at origin. It literally changed pricing discussions for the entire global industry. We then launched a roasting business in the United States, and got into the single serve cup manufacturing business when Keurig’s patents ran out. Many said we could not possibly be successful in such a highly technical venture against an operator with such manufacturing scale.Today, we are one of the leading providers of these products to some of the largest branded retailers in the world. We then purchased the largest provider of coffee and tea to restaurants and c stores unluckily three weeks before COVID shut them down for almost a year. Many predicted we would certainly fail because several others similarly situated did. We survive that and took the nascent Coffee Extract business that was resident in that business, and the core team that had created it, and launched what will soon be the largest roast to extract to ready to drink plant in the country.

During the second-quarter 2023, the segment's revenues increased 6.7% year over year to $202.7 million (approximately 70.5% of total revenue). The upside was driven by strong demand environment and consistent year-over-year growth in university inquiries. Notably, Strayer and Capella Universities reported strong new student enrollment. Capella continuously invests in introducing new programs and specializations to improve student outcomes. Continuous innovation and course updates expand its product portfolio, which in turn boost enrollments and drive long-term growth.The company is focusing on providing programs based on a “competency-based learning model and direct assessment capabilities”.

This led to the impressive second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 13th consecutive quarter and the bottom line marked the 12th straight earnings beat.Earnings of $4.89 per share in second-quarter 2023 improved 14.5% from the $4.27 reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales grew 4.8% year over year to $1,191.3 million. The increase can be attributed to organic sales growth of 5.6%.Also, higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs, and gains from the company's RCI initiatives boosted margins in the said quarter. In the second quarter, the company’s gross profit of $603.7 million improved 9.1% year over year, while the gross margin expanded 200 basis points (bps) year over year to 50.7%. This is in sync with our estimate of gross margin expansion of 130 bps.The company’s operating earnings before financial services totaled $277 million, up 12.3% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 160 bps to 23.3% in the second quarter. Financial Services' operating earnings were $66.9 million in the quarter, up 2.5% year over year. Consolidated operating earnings (including financial services) were $343.9 million, up 10.3% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings expanded 130 bps year over year to 26.8%.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research SNA is dedicated to various strategic principles and processes aimed at creating value in areas like RCI. The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs, beside helping Snap-on boost sales and margins, and generate savings. Savings from the RCI initiative reflect gains from the continuous productivity and process improvement plans.Management intends to boost customer services, along with enhancing manufacturing and supply-chain capabilities through the RCI initiatives and further investments. Apart from this, Snap-on’s ability to innovate bodes well. The company has also been investing in new products and increasing brand awareness across the world.The company is comfortably funding shareholder cash distributions at their current level, has sufficient financial health, and produces plenty of cash to meet its financial obligations. In the quarter under review, it approved a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share, payable Jun 9, of shareholders’ record as of May 19.In second-quarter 2023, it paid out dividends of $85.9 million and repurchased 359,000 shares worth $94.8 million under its existing share repurchase programs. As of Jul 1, 2023, the company had $336.7 million remaining under its existing authorizations.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeSnap-on has been reeling under macroeconomic headwinds, which are likely to persist in 2023. Rising cost inflation, stemming from higher raw material expenses and other costs, is likely to be a deterrent. Also, the unfavorable currency is concerning.Wrapping UpAlthough the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds are likely to persist in 2023, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about SNA’s fundamentals. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.65 has underperformed the industry’s ratio of 18.04, which raises optimism about the stock.Topping it, a Momentum Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 8% reflect its inherent strength.

Management is used to telegraphing to analysts the trends in the business. But many of the retailers have had problems in the last year with excess inventory. They ordered too much and consumer demand changed from goods to experiences, like travel.Have retailers worked through their inventory issues in time for Back to School and the winter holidays?And will these reports support the “soft landing” argument?Target and 4 Other Key Retail Earnings Charts1.    Home Depot (HD) has only missed one time in the last 5 years and it was when the pandemic first started, in 2020. That’s impressive given what has happened since 2020 with supply chain and inventory issues. Shares of Home Depot are up just 4.8% year-to-date, which is underperforming the S&amp;P 500 which has gained 16.4%. But is it foolish to count out Home Depot?2.    Target Corp. (TGT) has beat 2 quarters in a row after posting 3 big misses. Shares of Target have fallen 12.1% year-to-date, which is under performing. Target is paying a dividend, yielding 3.3%. Is this a buying opportunity in Target?3.    TJX Companies (TJX) has beat 5 quarters in a row. Shares of TJX Companies are up 7.9% year-to-date but don’t be fooled by the under performance. It’s trading at new 5-year highs. TJX Companies had solid comparable sales in all of its segments last quarter except Home Goods, which is normalizing off of the pandemic demand. Will TJX Companies breakout with another earnings beat?4.    Walmart Inc. (WMT) has beat 4 quarters in a row. The Street is bullish on Walmart as shares are up 13.7% year-to-date and are at 5-year highs. Walmart isn’t cheap, on a P/E basis. It trades at 25.8x.

ROST may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Ross Stores is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ROST in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.17 per share for ROST, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ROST, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.91% heading into earnings season.Ross Stores, Inc.

221,c841faa8-74e6-304f-812e-b92d622bb6e9,NWSA,2023-08-15,News (NASDAQ:NWSA) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.10,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/news-nasdaq-nwsa-due-pay-100236569.html,1692093756,STORY,['NWSA'],"[News Corporation's (NASDAQ:NWSA) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.10 per share on 11th of October. This means the annual payment will be 0.9% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average. See our latest analysis for News News' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. The last payment made up 77% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 16% which is fairly sustainable.historic-dividendNews Is Still Building Its Track RecordNews' dividend has been pretty stable for a little while now, but we will continue to be cautious until it has been demonstrated for a few more years. The payments haven't really changed that much since 8 years ago. We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.Dividend Growth Could Be ConstrainedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that News has been growing its earnings per share at 58% a year over the past five years. Fast growing earnings are great, but this can rarely be sustained without some reinvestment into the business, which News hasn't been doing.Our Thoughts On News' DividendOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for News that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Is News not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

This led to the impressive second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 13th consecutive quarter and the bottom line marked the 12th straight earnings beat.Earnings of $4.89 per share in second-quarter 2023 improved 14.5% from the $4.27 reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales grew 4.8% year over year to $1,191.3 million. The increase can be attributed to organic sales growth of 5.6%.Also, higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs, and gains from the company's RCI initiatives boosted margins in the said quarter. In the second quarter, the company’s gross profit of $603.7 million improved 9.1% year over year, while the gross margin expanded 200 basis points (bps) year over year to 50.7%. This is in sync with our estimate of gross margin expansion of 130 bps.The company’s operating earnings before financial services totaled $277 million, up 12.3% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 160 bps to 23.3% in the second quarter. Financial Services' operating earnings were $66.9 million in the quarter, up 2.5% year over year. Consolidated operating earnings (including financial services) were $343.9 million, up 10.3% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings expanded 130 bps year over year to 26.8%.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research SNA is dedicated to various strategic principles and processes aimed at creating value in areas like RCI. The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs, beside helping Snap-on boost sales and margins, and generate savings. Savings from the RCI initiative reflect gains from the continuous productivity and process improvement plans.Management intends to boost customer services, along with enhancing manufacturing and supply-chain capabilities through the RCI initiatives and further investments. Apart from this, Snap-on’s ability to innovate bodes well. The company has also been investing in new products and increasing brand awareness across the world.The company is comfortably funding shareholder cash distributions at their current level, has sufficient financial health, and produces plenty of cash to meet its financial obligations. In the quarter under review, it approved a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share, payable Jun 9, of shareholders’ record as of May 19.In second-quarter 2023, it paid out dividends of $85.9 million and repurchased 359,000 shares worth $94.8 million under its existing share repurchase programs. As of Jul 1, 2023, the company had $336.7 million remaining under its existing authorizations.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeSnap-on has been reeling under macroeconomic headwinds, which are likely to persist in 2023. Rising cost inflation, stemming from higher raw material expenses and other costs, is likely to be a deterrent. Also, the unfavorable currency is concerning.Wrapping UpAlthough the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds are likely to persist in 2023, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about SNA’s fundamentals. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.65 has underperformed the industry’s ratio of 18.04, which raises optimism about the stock.Topping it, a Momentum Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 8% reflect its inherent strength.

225,08b7108c-375e-3181-ba81-b27d141328e8,VZ,2023-08-15,15 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-worst-performing-blue-chip-113530961.html,1692099330,STORY,"['KO', 'DIS', 'IBM', 'JNJ', 'VZ', 'CVX', 'UNH', 'AMGN', 'MRK', 'WBA', 'NKE', 'MMM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 worst performing blue chip stocks in 2023. If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023Photo by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the worst performing blue chip stocks in 2023, we calculated the year to date share price returns of the 30 companies on the Dow 30 index.

The same suggests an increase of about 23.1% from the year-earlier quarter’s figure. The consensus estimate of $1,667 million for quarterly revenues indicates growth of about 2.6% from the prior-year quarter’s tally.In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 32.2%. Tapestry, which has announced plans to acquire Capri Holdings Limited, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.7%, on average. (Read more: Tapestry to Acquire Capri Holdings in a $8.5B Cash Deal)Factors to NoteA consumer-centric approach, omnichannel capabilities, brand strength and an emphasis on high-growth areas are likely to have benefited Tapestry’s fourth-quarter performance. Its Acceleration Program has been a major contributing factor as well. The company has been focused on deepening engagement with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products and expanding digital and data analytics capabilities.On its last earnings call, management had envisioned revenues of $6.7 billion to grow 3% year over year at constant currency. The company had guided earnings per share in the band of $3.85-$3.90, representing low-double-digit growth year over year on an adjusted basis. Management forecasted earnings between $3.70 per share and $3.75 per share. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands are pegged at $1,249 million and $73 million, respectively. These estimates show year-over-year growth of 3.3% and 1.4%, respectively.However, a tough operating environment and foreign exchange headwinds are likely to have been a spoilsport. Management had cited that the earnings per share view includes a currency headwind of approximately 40 cents. Meanwhile, any deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses are likely to have been added deterrents.Story continuesWhat Our Zacks Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Tapestry this time around.

To skip our detailed analysis of conservative investing in the current market, you can go directly to see the Conservative Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks To Buy.Markets are jittery again amid analyst firms downgrading banks and some circles still warning about recession despite inflation showing some signs of cooling. At the same time, the US is going through a rough patch in terms of its debt rating, what with the Fitch Ratings downgrading US debt from AAA to AA+, a move that was claimed to be influenced by deteriorating governance standards. The US financial sector is also facing yet another challenge, with Moody's this time downgrading about 11 US banks while taking 16 other negative rating actions on other regional banks in the country. All of these moves have come about in close succession to one another in July and August, putting the everyday investor in a frantic state of mind when it comes to figuring out where they can put their money and be able to rest easy.What Is Conservative Investing?Considering the above, there are many investors today who are looking for safe and reliable stock options to beef up their portfolios and ensure they aren't hit too hard by worrying market conditions. Because of this, conservative investing is a strategy that is coming to the forefront. This strategy entails a defensive investment style with a focus on low-risk investments. The aim of the strategy is to achieve capital security while providing investors with steady and reliable income and protection for their invested capital. Many investors look at reliable dividend stocks as part of this strategy since these stocks offer steady passive income that can tide them by in volatile markets. Blue chip stocks, or generally renowned companies with solid balance sheets and financial strength, are also top picks for conservative stock portfolios.Story continuesWhile building a conservative stock portfolio in the second half of 2023, investors can take a look at several sectors that have been performing well and are expected to continue this level of performance later in the year as well. These include the tech and consumer staples sectors and even the healthcare sector, among others. On August 14, Paul Meeks, a tech investor and portfolio manager at Independent Solutions Wealth Management, was invited to CNBC's TechCheck, and he said the following about the tech sector in particular:""What I've seen is that there were a number of tech stocks that deserved to have big 2023 ramps, and there were a number of tech stocks that probably were frauds that didn't deserve it. And so unfortunately, the whole sector got grossly overbought, and now we're starting to see some reality, we're starting to see some consolidation, and I actually think that consolidation might continue a bit further.""Buying Opportunities In TechMeeks' insights on the tech sector can prove valuable to any conservative investors looking to buy into this sector today since he clearly lays out the ground reality of the sector by stating that stocks within this area have been overbought by eager investors. Despite this, Meeks stated that while tech weakness is expected to continue, he does see a ""buying opportunity"" in some tech names.

In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc.

DVA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and the acquisition of dialysis centers are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 17.3% against the 11.1% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 4.2% growth in the said time frame.The renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider has a market capitalization of $9.89 billion. The company projects 12.7% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 21.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Q2 Results: DaVita’s solid second-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and dialysis patient service revenues. An increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments was also seen. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock.DaVita Kidney Care: We are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Jun 30, 2023, the company had approximately 64,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses, which own and operate dialysis centers, as well as other ancillary services, is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.Story continuesAs of Jun 30, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 248,000 patients at 3,056 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,703 were U.S. centers while 353 were located across 11 other countries. In the second quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of 10 new dialysis centers in the United States. It also acquired two dialysis centers and opened two dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 8.9% north to $7.08.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.00 billion, suggesting a 1.9% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and McKesson Corporation MCK.Cardinal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 13.5%.

It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to support its margins moving ahead. It is also expected to benefit from higher pricing and volumes.The company, in its fiscal third quarter call, said that it expects full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.40-$11.50, indicating 11-12% growth from the prior year’s adjusted EPS. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $3.04-$3.14, suggesting a rise of 7-10% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS.Air Products also remains committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong balance sheet and cash flows. APD, earlier this year, increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.75 per share from $1.62 per share. This marked the 41st straight year of dividend increase. The company expects to pay more than $1.5 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2023.However, Air Products is exposed to headwinds from unfavorable currency translation. The company saw currency headwinds in its Asia segment in the last reported quarter due to the weakening of Asian currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, which reduced its sales and EBITDA for the unit by 5% in the quarter. It is likely to face continued currency headwinds in the fiscal fourth quarter.The slowdown in China and Europe may also affect the company’s business in these regions. The cooling China economy might impact volumes in the Industrial Gases - Asia segment. The lack of growth in industrial output in Europe is another concern.Story continues Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Price and Consensus Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023Photo by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the worst performing blue chip stocks in 2023, we calculated the year to date share price returns of the 30 companies on the Dow 30 index.

(NASDAQ: AKAM) (""Akamai""), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced that it proposes to offer, subject to market factors and other conditions, $1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029. The notes are to be sold only to persons reasonably believed to be ""qualified institutional buyers"" pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). In addition, Akamai will grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional $150,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes on the same terms and conditions. Upon conversion, Akamai will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Akamai's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Akamai's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted. Interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2024. The notes will mature on February 15, 2029, unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The interest rate, initial conversion rate, offering price and other terms will be determined at the time of pricing the offering. The notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Akamai.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)Subject to costs and expenses related to the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions and share repurchases described below, Akamai intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering to repay at maturity a portion of its $1,150 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 0.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, which mature on May 1, 2025, and/or to pay cash amounts due upon any earlier conversion thereof.Story continuesAkamai intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described below (after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds to Akamai from the sale of warrants pursuant to the warrant transactions described below). If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Akamai expects to sell additional warrants to certain of the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates (the ""Option Counterparties"") and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of such additional notes, together with the proceeds from the additional warrant transactions, to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions with the Option Counterparties.Akamai also intends to use approximately $68 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock from purchasers of the notes in the offering in privately-negotiated transactions effected through one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates. Akamai expects the purchase price per share in such transactions to equal the closing price per share of Akamai's common stock on the date of pricing of the offering. The amount of Akamai's common stock that Akamai actually repurchases may be more or less than $68 million.In connection with the pricing of the notes, Akamai expects to enter into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the same number of shares of Akamai's common stock that will initially underlie the notes, including any notes purchased by the initial purchasers pursuant to their option to purchase additional notes. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution with respect to Akamai's common stock upon conversion of the notes and/or to offset any cash payments Akamai is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. The warrants will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the same number of shares of Akamai's common stock. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect with respect to Akamai's common stock to the extent that the market price per share of Akamai's common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants, unless Akamai elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the warrants in cash.In connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the Option Counterparties and/or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Akamai's common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Akamai's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Akamai's common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the Option Counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Akamai's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Akamai's common stock or other securities of Akamai in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes or following any repurchase of the notes by Akamai on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Akamai's common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of holders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that holders receive upon conversion of the notes.This press release is being issued pursuant to Rule 135c under the Securities Act and shall not constitute an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of Akamai's common stock, if any, issuable upon conversion of the notes). Any offer of notes will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.The release contains information about future expectations, plans and prospects of Akamai's management that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements with respect to Akamai's expectations to complete the proposed offering of the notes, its use of proceeds from the offering and the effect of the concurrent stock repurchase and the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. There can be no assurance that Akamai will be able to complete the proposed notes offering on the anticipated terms, or at all. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including, but not limited to, the terms of the notes and the offering, risks and uncertainties related to whether or not Akamai will consummate the offering, the impact of general economic, industry, market or political conditions and other factors that are discussed in Akamai's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents periodically filed with the SEC.In addition, the statements in this press release represent Akamai's expectations and beliefs as of the date of this press release. Akamai anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause these expectations and beliefs to change. However, while Akamai may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Growing Dividend Stocks with Low PE Ratios. Despite facing several challenges like turbulence in the banking sector and ongoing uncertainties about the economy's condition, the U.S. stock market has managed to consistently rise during the first seven months of the year. The S&amp;P 500 is up 16.7% year-to-date and the tech-heavy NASDAQ gained 31.3%. This recovery was unexpected by analysts, given the sharp decline in stock values in 2022. In addition to this, there have been shifts in investment patterns, with tech stocks grabbing the limelight.That said, investors are also focusing on dividend stocks because the requirement for cash remains consistent, regardless of the ongoing economic circumstances. Analysts recommend that investors should keep adding dividend stocks to their portfolios, as these stocks are expected to show growth in the second half of the year. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson Investors, reviewed the first half of 2023 and presented a positive outlook on dividend stocks. He said that so far this year, dividends have been increasing, boosted by special dividends and share buybacks. Cash generation is still robust with many larger companies transferring the added expenses due to inflation to their customers. He further highlighted that the dividend outlook is strong. However, as the impact of increased interest rates affects both companies and consumers, it's important to diversify investments and prioritize companies with solid financial standings.

URI stock has gained 37.2% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry’s 35.9% growth. The company has been gaining from the sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business. The year 2023 exhibits widespread growth opportunities across its verticals, with continuous growth opportunities for non-residential and industrial verticals.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 16%, which highlights its inherent strength. We believe that United Rentals offers a sound investment opportunity, which is evident from its VGM Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the past 30 days as analysts raised their estimates. Over the said time frame, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $40.63 for 2023 has increased from $39.89. The estimated figure indicates 25% year-over-year growth.However, high variable costs and intense competition are concerns.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a look at the factors supporting the growth.Solid End-Market Demand, High Infrastructural Investment: United Rentals and other construction companies have been riding on robust worldwide shifts toward infrastructure modernization, energy transition, bolstered national security, and a potential upsurge in global supply-chain investments. Notably, United Rentals is expected to maintain its momentum in the near term, as the company’s solutions are closely aligned with President Biden’s policies and industry trends.The need to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges and fund new climate-resilient and broadband initiatives is expected to help URI. The company expects a diverse mix of federal projects for road and bridge work, water control, harbors and ports and the power grid, which will drive growth in 2023.In second-quarter 2023, equipment rentals represented 83.9% of the company’s total revenues. United Rentals has been witnessing widespread growth in rental revenues. In the quarter, rental revenues grew 21% year over year to $2.98 billion. For the third quarter and 2023, our model predicts equipment rentals revenue growth of 14.6% to $3.13 billion and 18% to $11.93 billion, respectively, year over year.URI has seen substantial opportunities in 2023 across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders.Upbeat View: Backed by the company’s multi-year tailwinds in infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy and power, along with strong customer demand, URI raised its 2023 guidance on the second-quarter 2023 earnings call. This reflects stronger growth in the core rental business and sustained demand in its end markets. The optimism was supported by persistent share growth opportunities for certain non-residential verticals, including data centers, distribution centers and renewables, as well as the automotive and ship plants.Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $14-$14.3 billion compared with $13.7-$14.2 billion projected earlier. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $6.75 billion and $6.9 billion compared with the prior projection of $6.6-$6.85 billion.Higher ROE: United Rentals’ trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is indicative of its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 36.7% compares favorably with the industry’s 10%, which signals more efficiency in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Story continues3 Construction Stocks to ConsiderBased in Los Angeles, KB Home KBH has been gaining from prudent growth plans, a solid existing geographic footprint and a built-to-order approach.KBH currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

To then get an extra few percentage points of performance through dividends is an added bonus. Second, firms that pay dividends tend to be more stable. They also tend to grow over time in a relatively predictable manner.It’s a simple but powerful combination that has served investors well and will continue to serve them well. What’s also nice is that in these inflationary times, dividends serve to blunt the effects of rising prices.Here are seven of the best dividend stocks to buy, for those seeking both income and upside in this current market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSolaris Oilfield Infrastructure (SOI)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comSolaris Oilfield Infrastructure (NYSE:SOI) is an interesting dividend stock for energy investors.The firm’s most recent earnings report notes that Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure “provides mobile equipment that drives supply chain and execution efficiencies in the completion of oil and natural gas wells.” That’s a bit vague. Those mobile systems deliver proppant which is a solid material like ceramics or treated sand, used to keep hydraulic fractures open in oilfields.Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure’s fundamentals portray a sort of mixed bag. Revenues declined by 10.96% in Q2, falling to $77.2 million. That isn’t positive no matter how you spin it. However, revenues did increase by over 11% during the first half of 2023. Additionally, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure’s net income increased in both Q2 and the first six months of the year.More income means the company can easily continue to pay dividends that currently sit above 4%.Valero (VLO)Black oil barrel that reads ""oil"" on the side in a pool of oil with other barrelsSource: ShutterstockValero (NYSE:VLO) is another energy stock investors should take a look at. Many readers will recognize Valero for its gas stations which are ubiquitous throughout the U.S. However, Valero is also among the largest oil refiners globally, operating 15 refineries across the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Valero has also grown to become the world’s second-largest refiner of renewable diesel.Story continuesThe company, like nearly every other energy firm, has had a wild few last years. Indeed, 2021 provided massive growth for the firm with revenues growing more than 75% to $113.97 billion. Of course, 2022 was even better. The company’s revenue soared above $176 billion, but is generally considered to be an aberration year, given the company’s record profitability. That said, this year Valero should easily eclipse its 2021 top-line performance.There’s nearly $20 of upside beyond VLO’s current share price, per consensus views. Add to that a dividend yielding above 3% that hasn’t been reduced in 13 years, and Valero becomes very attractive.Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) offers investors three things that I’d argue make it a screaming buy at this point: growth, value, and relatively strong income for investors.The growth argument is very straightforward in regard to Public Storage. The firm’s 3-year revenue and EBITDA growth rates are near the 90th percentile within its sector. Public Storage also released strong earnings on Aug. 2 that showed continued growth in 2023.The value argument behind PSA stock is also simple. Currently, PSA stock trades lower than 61% of competitors relative to earnings, suggesting that it is currently undervalued and a potential deal for investors.And then there’s the income argument for Public Storage. The dividend’s forward yield exceeds 4%, which is relatively high. While the yield is relatively high, the firm hasn’t reduced the dividend since 1992. It is precisely the kind of high-yielding, lower-risk option investors should want to consider.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comRecall a recent trip to the supermarket and you’ll understand why PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) is a buy. High prices and high demand for its products have resulted in continued strong earnings for the firm.A bag of chips and a soda costs more than it did in the recent past. However, it hasn’t fazed snackers, with consumers continuing to absorb price hikes for snacks. Pepsi CFO Hugh Johnston notes that snacking hasn’t suffered a demand pullback like higher ticket items have. He characterizes soft drinks and snacks including Mt. Dew and Lay’s as affordable luxuries that remain in high demand. Johnston also notes that these small luxuries are taking the place of larger items as consumers tighten their purse strings.The effect has been positive for Pepsi, as Q2 revenues exceeded Wall Street’s expectations by $600 million. The bonus for investors is that even as Pepsi surges, it continues to offer upside based on share price consensus expectations.Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comKraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) is another food producer stock investors should consider for its dividend and growth profile, although its narrative is different from that for Pepsi.The primary difference between the two is that Kraft Heinz didn’t beat revenue expectations in Q2. Sales grew by 2.6% to $6.72 billion, falling somewhat short of expectations. However, the 79 cents in earnings from the firm did exceed expectations and increased 12.9% on a year-over-year basis.Strong earnings mean the firm can reinvest in its business lines while also continuing to reward investors with dividend payouts. Kraft Heinz includes a dividend yielding 4.5% currently. That’s an attractive proposition for most investors.The company expects organic revenue growth in the range of 4-6% this year. In Q2, organic revenues grew by 4%, so it’s entirely reasonable to expect that range to continue to year-end. Kraft Heinz shares sport a beta of 0.67, so it’s a good place to park capital for the purposes of preservation while simultaneously offering dividend income.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comIt’s currently a great time to make a bet on Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The company is undergoing a Covid-19 vaccine hangover. It’s gone from a massive winner to a “what have you done for me lately” story in the eyes of many investors.The pandemic is over, meaning Pfizer’s cash flows from its vaccine have dried up. This led to the company visibly missing revenue expectations for the second quarter. What, then, should logically galvanize investors to put their capital behind Pfizer at this point?The answer is growth expectations. The company has given notice that it will roll out 19 new products or new uses in the coming 18 months. Investors will receive a dividend that adds nearly 5% to their returns for making that bet on the company’s future growth.Pfizer is doing what winning pharmaceutical firms do –  creating blockbuster products, reinvesting windfall revenues into future growth, and developing the next iteration of that growth cycle. Notably, PFE stock is as cheap as it’s been this year. The income and upside narrative is stronger for PFE stock than just about any other pharmaceutical name right now of this quality.Brookfield Renewable (BEPC)Brookfield Renewable logo on a phone screen. BEPC stock. BEP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockBrookfield Renewable (NYSE:BEPC) is something of a hybrid between utility stock and green energy growth stock. The firm owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets that provide income, hence its likeness to utility firms. Meanwhile, it clearly touches on the growth trends the green energy sector provides, and therefore offers meaningful upside.Wall Street certainly believes that Brookfield Renewable will provide meaningful upside to investors. The consensus price target  analyst have assigned BEPC shares is $10 above its current price of $28. Brookfield Renewable provides substantial dividend income with a yield of 4.8%. That combination has kept the firm on the radar of many investors, who may be looking for undervalued income-producing gems.I would note that BEPC shares are inexpensive as well. The company’s price-to-earnings ratio of 3.45-times means that shares are priced lower than 91% of competitors relative to earnings. Thus, Brookfield Renewable is another very compelling growth and income story to consider now.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

He is most famous for winning a charity auction with Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), which led to a lifelong friendship with Buffetts business partner, Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio).Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with MU. Click here to check it out. MU 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MUPabrais investments are widely followed and he often talks about his investments in various interviews. In this discussion, I will break down his surprising sale of Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). Lets dive in.Was Mohnish Pabrai Wrong to Exit Micron?MicronPabrai is known for having a number of focused bets. Previously, Micron made up the largest position in his U.S. investment portfolio.This is why it was surprising to see that he sold all 1.59 million shares, according to 13F filings for the three months ended June 30. The stock traded for an average price of $64 per share during the quarter.Pabrai is no stranger for making surprising moves, having previously loaded up on Alibaba (BABA) stock before selling out. He admitted in an interview that this was for tax harvesting and he still believed in the companys prospects.In the case of Micron, Pabrai could be now taking some profit again as he originally purchased the stock at just $37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. However, he has then added to his position multiple times over the past couple of years at various ranges close to $85 per share, which is more expensive than where the stock trades at the time of writing.Was Mohnish Pabrai Wrong to Exit Micron?What does Micron do?Micron is the fourth-largest semiconductor company in the world and the third-largest supplier of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM. This is an essential building block for all computers, from a mobile phone to a laptop and even a large-scale data center.The investment thesis is that it is a play on the hunger for DRAM, which will be required to power the next digital revolution.Story continuesA forecast by McKinsey indicates the semiconductor industry will reach a value of $1 trillion by 2030. Therefore, Micron is expected to ride this wave.AI building blockMicron could also benefit from the huge forecasted growth in the artificial intelligence industry. An average server tailored for AI applications uses up to 8 times as much DRAM and 3 times as much NAND (Micron's second major business line), according to Microns management.Specifically, the company has recently launched the DDR5 RAM, which is specifically designed for AI workloads. In general, this new chipset has showcased an 85% increase in performance over the prior generation.Cyclical financialsA challenge Micron faces is its cyclical financials. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company reported $3.75 billion in revenue, which was down 57% year over year. However, this decline was expected and the revenue result still beat analyst forecasts by $75.5 million.By product type, Micron generated $2.7 billion, or 71% of its revenue, from its DRAM technology. This revenue fell by 2% quarter over quarter, but shipment volume rose by 10%. Therefore, the dip was driven by a supply glut that impacted prices.Microns NAND revenue was $1 billion, or 27% of the total. This revenue rose by 14% quarter over quarter, while volume increased by 30%. Similar to DRAM, this growth was offset slightly by a mid-teen price decline.Was Mohnish Pabrai Wrong to Exit Micron?Moving on to revenue by business unit, its Compute and Networking Business reported $1.4 billion, which rose by 1% quarter over quarter. This was driven by strong growth in graphics and server applications. While client (personal) computing struggled due to the industry-wide decline, Microns chief financial officer believes data center revenue hit a bottom in the prior quarter and, therefore, is now on an upward trajectory, which could be enhanced by an AI catalyst.The Embedded Business Unit reported revenue of $912 million, up 5% quarter over quarter, while the Mobile Business unit reported a 13% decline in revenue to $819 million.Microns storage business reported $627 million in revenue, up 24% quarter over quarter on the back of strong shipment volume.,China banOn May 21, Chinas Cyberspace Administration implemented a ban on Microns products due to cybersecurity concerns. This is believed to be a reaction to the U.S. blacklisting certain Chinese products from companies like Huawei and, more recently, the ban given to Nvidia on selling its latest AI chips in China.Micron has around one quarter of its revenue exposed, but management estimated that approximately half of its China-based revenue would be impacted. Therefore, this is not as bad as initially thought with a low double-digit decline expected.Margins and balance sheetMicron reported a $1.6 billion loss in the third quarter, which was down substantially from the $2.9 billion profit reported in the prior year. A positive is its losses have narrowed from the $2.2 billion loss reported in the prior quarter.The general decline has been driven by the aforementioned price drop across its products, driven by industry oversupply.Micron reported a loss of $1.73 per share, which beat analyst forecasts by 1 cent.Was Mohnish Pabrai Wrong to Exit Micron?Moving on to its balance sheet, the company reported $10.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. It also has $13.9 billion in total debt, of which the vast majority ($11.8 billion) is long term.The company also has a 0.7% forward dividend yield, which looks consistent.ValuationMicron trades with a price-sales ratio of 3.94, which is slightly higher than its five-year average. I believe its valuation metrics are skewed by the profitability changes.This also looks to have influenced the GF Value Line, which states the stock is significantly overvalued with a fair value of $43 per share.Was Mohnish Pabrai Wrong to Exit Micron?The best figures I prefer to use for the valuation of Micron includes the average guru buy price of $64 per share (where the stock traded at the time of writing). This is the approximate level that investors such as Yacktman Asset Management (Trades, Portfolio) and Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) have been loading up on.Final thoughtsMicron is good company with a solid market position. The company is expected to benefit from further digitization and the growth in AI. The main challenge it faces at this time is the cyclical decline in the industry, which may take at least a few quarters more to correct.The sale of the stock by Pabrai is intriguing. The only major fundamental change is the regulatory ban in China. While we know this will give the revenue a haircut, it is not a company killer. Therefore, I believe Pabrai may be wrong on this one, though he may have just sold for opportunity cost, profit-taking or tax harvesting reasons. However, prudent investors may still wish to trim their position slightly due to the China ban.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

It also asked financial services company executives reciprocal questions about how, in reality, they are investing and innovating.The research revealed that high inflation and the rising cost of living (83%), economic recession (79%), high interest rates (76%), and lack of confidence in the financial system (54%) are all weighing on consumers as they make financial decisions. Consumers also said they would value a one-stop solution that would make managing their finances easier.Consumers want an all-in-one solution to manage their financial services, but executives at financial services companies are taking a broad-brush approach to investment and innovation:47% of consumers said access to a single platform to manage all their financial services activity from all their providers was their top priority when asked what features and services they were most interested in using if offered by their financial service provider.There was consistent interest across generations in having one platform to manage all their financial activity, with every cohort picking it as their top priority (Boomers 57%, Gen-X 50%, Millennials 43% and Gen-Z 39%).While consumers expressed interest in using a single financial services platform, only 51% of surveyed financial services executives stated they plan to increase investment in the ""management of multiple accounts/financial services from different providers"" in the next 12 months.Story continues""This research shows that despite consumers wanting to be able to see and manage their financial services in a unified platform, financial services companies are still taking a broader approach to investment across fraud and risk mitigation, digital wallets, generative AI, metaverse and other areas in equal capacity,"" said Tarun Bhatnagar, President, Platform and Enterprise Products at FIS. ""As embedded finance and open banking mature across the US and UK, there is a significant market opportunity for financial services companies to deliver a unique all-in-one platform experience for their customers while uncovering new revenue streams.""While business executives at financial services companies said that economic headwinds like high inflation and the rising cost of living (86%), economic recession (84%), high interest rates (84%), and systemic challenges to the financial system (84%) are impacting their ability to invest and innovate, many intend to increase or maintain investments in future forward technologies.Business executives are taking a future forward approach to investment with a broad-brush approach:91% of financial services company executives in the US and 78% in the UK say high interest rates are impacting their ability to innovate and invest.However, 92% of executives across the US and UK said they plan to increase or maintain investment in each of the following: fraud/risk mitigation solutions, digital wallets, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies for processing as well as 91% increasing/maintaining their investment in generative AI and 87% in metaverse.""Executives are telling us that they’re feeling the crunch of the economic uncertainty every bit as much as consumers, which is affecting how they are investing. From this research we can we see many executives leaning into more future-looking tech like AI and digital wallets,"" Bhatnagar added. ""Further, technology like generative AI is extremely new and executives are just beginning to explore how they can use it to create improved customer experiences as well as enhancing self-service for those customers while seeking novel ways to reduce operational expenses.""About the FIS Financial Services Expectations vs Reality ResearchFIS conducted a survey of 4,000 consumers and 800 business executives in the financial services industry in the US and UK in May 2023.

The industry suffered a lot during the peak of the pandemic, with sales nosediving. The struggle continued till last year before making a solid turnaround.The trend has since continued and even rising costs and inflationary pressures haven’t impacted sales much. In fact, higher demand has been driving sales almost every month. Given this situation, stocks like BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO, Chuy's Holdings, Inc. CHUY, McDonald's Corporation MCD and Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment, Inc. PLAY are likely to benefit in the near term.Restaurant Sales JumpSales as U.S. bars and restaurants totaled $88.9 billion in June, matching the adjusted sales figures of the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, restaurant sales increased a solid 8.4% in June.The retail sector has been struggling for months as inflationary pressures continue to hamper sales. Despite that, sales have continued to grow and the restaurant industry has been largely responsible for boosting sales. Although higher prices have made consumers spend cautiously over the past year, they have been shelling out lavishly at restaurants, which bodes well for the industry.In the retail sector, the Zacks Defined Restaurant Industry is presently ranked in the upper 15% among all industries, boasting a year-to-date return of 8.9%.Industry Poised to GrowMultiple factors are driving sales in the restaurant industry. This can be attributed to core aspects such as changes in operational procedures, workforce, layout designs and technological advancements.Restaurant owners are also focusing on digital advancements, strategies to boost sales and cost-saving endeavors. The increasing impact of the Internet has made digital innovation crucial. Prominent restaurant chains are consistently collaborating with delivery services and digital platforms to generate additional sales.Story continuesBesides, inflation has also declined over the past 12 months. Although the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased a modest 0.2% in July, inflation has sharply declined from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.Cooling inflation has raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its interest rate hike campaign. This is likely to further help the restaurant industry, as lower interest rates will allow people to spend more.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in these five restaurant stocks.BJ's Restaurants, Inc. owns and operates a chain of high-end casual dining restaurants in the United States.

The individual warehouses are located at 4400 and 4450 Hargrove Drive and 9300 Martin Luther King Jr. Highway, according to the Washington Business Journal, which first reported the deal. Prologis first announced the portfolio deal with Blackstone in June, which included 14 million square feet of warehouse and distribution space in key U.S. markets. The company has since spent $97 million on a FedEx distribution center in California’s Inland Empire and $92 million on two South Florida warehouses, in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. The Blackstone portfolio includes about 1.3 million square feet in the D.C. region, or roughly 9 percent of the total, per Prologis. The largest chunk of the portfolio is in the Atlanta region — at 22 percent — followed by Southern California at 15 percent. South Florida made up just 2 percent of the total, or 280,000 square feet. Current tenants at the Lanham campus include J.E.

TROW currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Over the past three months, shares of the company have gained 5.7% compared with the industry's upside of 12.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMentioned below are a few factors that make TROW a must-buy stock now:Revenue Strength: Organic growth is a key strength for T. Rowe Price, as reflected in its revenue growth history. Its net revenues witnessed a 2.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last three years (ended 2022). Though the trend reversed in the first six months of 2023, the company’s focus on fortifying its business by enhancing investment capabilities and broadening distribution reach will support the top line.Given the tough operating backdrop, we project net revenues to decline 2.5% this year but with the growth initiatives undertaken by the company, revenues are expected to rise 1.6% the next year.AUM Growth: The company’s AUM balance witnessed a CAGR of 5.2% over the past five years (2017-2022), with the momentum continuing in the first half of 2023.

288,51d37f37-51e9-340f-a8d5-de411388ede3,UPS,2023-08-15,Why stocks aren't jumping on earnings beats,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-stocks-arent-jumping-earnings-144631690.html,1692024391,VIDEO,"['UPS', 'AAPL', 'PYPL']","[Companies such as UPS (UPS), Apple (AAPL), and PayPal (PYPL) reported earnings that topped analyst estimates, yet their stocks didn't jump on the news. Yahoo Finance Reporter Alexandra Canal explains why investors may not be as enthusiastic about earnings beats as they traditionally are.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: 79% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings beats this quarter according to FactSet, but markets aren't responding in kind. So why do investors seem reluctant to celebrate these wins? Joining us now, we've got Yahoo Finance's senior reporter Alexandra Canal. Hey, Ali.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hey, Brad. And you're right, we haven't seen the same upward surprises that we've seen in the stock price, despite a lot of these companies beating on earnings. You can look at recent reports from UPS, Apple, PayPal, all beating on earnings, yet those stocks immediately dipped, following those results.And because earnings aren't delivering the same stock reactions as they've done in the past, that's bleeding over into some of the major averages and contributing to the stock slumps that we've seen so far this month. You can take a look at the S&amp;P 500, that's up 16% year to date. Yet in the month of August, that's actually down about 3%, same with the NASDAQ, down about 4% this month, while the Dow has lost roughly 1%.And there are a few things at play here, number one is the fact that valuations have just skyrocketed in this market, relative to the fundamentals. So we've seen a lot of overheated names that are more vulnerable to bad news. Morgan Stanley actually called this a sell-the-news dynamic for the market more broadly as investors seem to question how robust the economy is going to be in the second half of the year.If you look at inflation, that has come dow, although we took a bit of a pause last week in that CPI print, that Fitch downgrade with the US credit rating that also added to concerns. And we're also not seeing as many investors chase the FOMO reaction in stocks, that's something bank of America pointed out. Remember earlier this year, the AI hype that booms a lot of those tech stocks, we didn't necessarily see that repeat this time around.Story continuesAnd then if you take a look on the revenue side, we're seeing disinflation start to eat into some of those sales numbers, and it's interesting to see that investors seem to care less about earnings beats and are punishing companies that are missing on the top line. So there's a lot of things at play, very interesting market. I think once we get into Q3 and Q4 results, we'll see how this plays out, especially in terms of the economic data and what comes next with the Fed rate hikes, recession risks, a lot of play on the minds of investors.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it's also interesting as we go into retail earnings season, because this is an area where we had not necessarily seen the same pace of inflation. In other words, yes, maybe you were seeing consumer products companies raise prices on non-perishables, for example. But then the retailers weren't necessarily taking the next leg of margin, if that makes sense.In other words, if I'm Campbell's Soup, my can of soup might be more. But then is Walmart putting as much on top of that as they normally would? I don't know that was happening with the same kind of cadence, because they wanted to keep that traffic in there.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and the health of the consumer, that's always top of mind for investors, for analysts, for stock-watchers. And we've seen the consumer continue to spend in this economy, despite inflation. We've seen confidence in the economy, we've seen spending up. We get those retail sales results tomorrow, and that'll be a key indicator moving forward about the health of the consumer in this market. Whether or not that's sustainable, though, I think is the big question.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, most definitely. And what they're buying in some of these big box retailers on which sides of the store is going to be really interesting, also. Ali, thank you so much.[INTERPOSING VOICES]]"

Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), NVR — as well as stocks that Berkshire Hathaway has increased its stakes in, such as Capital One (COF) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY).Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at a couple of trending tickers here after hours. We got to start with DR Horton, Lennar, and NVR. The reason why these three names are up on your screen is that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway took positions in all three of these companies. We're just getting the details from the most recent 13F filing.We know homebuilders have certainly been rallying here in recent weeks, off to a very strong start to the year. Taking a look at DR Horton, that stock up nearly 40% since January 1. When we take a look at a one-year chart, they're up just about 54%. So Berkshire Hathaway now owning 5.97 million shares of DR Horton, valuing that at $726.5 million.NVR, this is a parent company of Ryan Homes and NVHomes. We're looking at gains there as well, up just about 1% in extended trading. Over the last year, we've seen the stock rally just about 38%. And Lennar has been another winner within the homebuilder space. Certainly, we have seen some outperformance there.Also taking a look at two stocks that Berkshire Hathaway increased their positions with. First, Capital One raised their holding by 26%, now accounting for just about-- just over 3% of the outstanding shares. We're looking at gains of just about 6/10 of a percent.And Occidental Petroleum, a name that has been associated with Warren Buffett, with Berkshire Hathaway, in recent months, given the stake that we've gotten there. And if you can take a look at Occidental Petroleum, the chart that we have seen, since the start of the year, it is up just about 3%. So bucking some of the pressure that we have seen in the wider space. But Berkshire Hathaway now owning about 25% stake within the company.Story continuesAnd taking a look to that board that we just had up on the screen there of Berkshire Hathaway's top holdings. These have all remained unchanged. He has not adjusted his position here within these companies. But Apple, Bank of America, and Amex among the top holdings there for Berkshire Hathaway.Let's round it out with taking a look at Amazon. Some news breaking within just the last couple of minutes. Another executive change at the company. This time, Hardware Chief Dave Limp is retiring. He's been with Amazon for just over 13 years, about 13.5 years. Now, limp oversees Echo. He oversees he oversaw Fire TV tablets among many products there for Amazon. Now, this division was one of the ones that was very hard-hit in the recent layoffs that Amazon has announced.Year-to-date, Amazon shares up just about 67%, not a huge change here in extended trading. But again, just another executive change for Amazon under CEO Andy Jassy.]"

We believe that we are on the right path but are always looking to improve our approach in order to go further, faster.Story continuesOur Carbon FootprintApproximately 64% of Mondelēz International's CO2e emissions comes from our raw materials, concentrated in four key commodities. This informs and inspires our focus on reducing carbon emissions and increasing resilient landscapes.Our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable energy and energy efficiency. In 2022, we reduced our Scopes 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately 20% versus our 2018 baseline.1 We increased our emphasis on electrification and alternate fuels in our operations to continue the decarbonization journey of emission sources within our direct control.Our Scope 3 activities span across multiple work streams with the aim to be able to measure and reduce our indirect emissions by focusing on the biggest drivers initially. Key outcomesin 2022 include:Cocoa Life: Translating our deforestation free and agroforestry interventions into custom emission factors using farm level data resulted in lower emission intensity vs. generic emission factors when looking at major sourcing countries.

Through tracking of GHG emissions and developing action plans to reduce emissions, both farming groups have completed their baseline and are in year-two of their reduction program.To date, the groups are achieving reduced carbon intensity, respectively, vs. initial baseline.Find out more on page 45.Partnering for People &amp; Planet supplier partnership program: We formed new partnerships in 2022 with EcoVadis and Guidehouse LoCT to track and support supplier capability building toward ambitious carbon reduction plans by 2030 across our top 250 supplier network.Partnering on innovative technologies: We are exploring a wide range of new ideas and disruptive technologies that can help accelerate progress against our sustainability goals.Changes in investment holdings in other companies: We are capturing the proportionate share of investments in our carbon footprint and as such reflect interactions including reduction of holdings in our analysis.These activities have helped us to maintain a relatively flat Scope 3 since 2018. As we prepare for submission of our net zero ambition plan to the SBTi for validation this year, we are reflecting on what we've learned from these programs and the levers we can use to accelerate decarbonization.Next StepsOur continued focus lies on preparation for the net zero submission for validation with the SBTi.In 2022, we completed the re-baseline cycle for building a strong foundation. We are now in the process of adjusting our SBTi scope boundaries while considering the more recent launch of the SBTi's guidance on Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) emissions and finalizing our reduction pathway towards our net zero goal.The above steps are essential and are building up towards the submission to the SBTi for validation. While we appreciate that the submission takes time, we want to be sure thatour efforts are solid and founded. This does not mean that our progress on decarbonization stands still as we continue to execute our roadmaps in line with existing goals.Accelerating New Products and Technologies to get Closer to Net ZeroWe worked with a third-party consultant, PA Consulting, to explore a wide range of new ideas and disruptive technologies that could help accelerate progress against our sustainability goals. This included accelerated thinking to help inform our roadmap to achieve our long-term goal of net zero carbon; ideation workshops with a range of experts to identify opportunities and shortlist technologies that can help decarbonize global products; and recommendations that influenced our carbon plans.With PA Consulting's help, our R&amp;D function was able to identify four pillars of potential, accelerated decarbonization activity: net zero manufacturing, next generation cocoa, regenerative farming, and ingredients of the future. Deep dives on each of these pillars considered specific challenges such as how the company could incentivize farmers to adopt more regenerative farming practices or how plant microbiomes could be enhanced to help drive crop yields. The output was a series of recommendations, setting out potential next steps for consideration of technologies with the highest emissions reduction potential.Read more in the Mondelēz 2022 Snacking Made Right Report1 Annual GHG emissions are accounted for following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:38% = US$11b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.38 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Coca-Cola has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Coca-Cola's Debt And Its 38% Return On EquityCoca-Cola clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.57. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 is up 16.7% year-to-date and the tech-heavy NASDAQ gained 31.3%. This recovery was unexpected by analysts, given the sharp decline in stock values in 2022. In addition to this, there have been shifts in investment patterns, with tech stocks grabbing the limelight.That said, investors are also focusing on dividend stocks because the requirement for cash remains consistent, regardless of the ongoing economic circumstances. Analysts recommend that investors should keep adding dividend stocks to their portfolios, as these stocks are expected to show growth in the second half of the year. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson Investors, reviewed the first half of 2023 and presented a positive outlook on dividend stocks. He said that so far this year, dividends have been increasing, boosted by special dividends and share buybacks. Cash generation is still robust with many larger companies transferring the added expenses due to inflation to their customers. He further highlighted that the dividend outlook is strong. However, as the impact of increased interest rates affects both companies and consumers, it's important to diversify investments and prioritize companies with solid financial standings. To know more about companies with strong dividend growth streaks, read our article Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 Aristocrats.When looking for dividend-paying companies, it is crucial to determine whether the dividend being paid is dependable and offers the chance for growth in the future, such as dividend coming from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Incyte's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Incyte How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Incyte is:7.7% = US$366m ÷ US$4.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Incyte's Earnings Growth And 7.7% ROEWhen you first look at it, Incyte's ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 21% either. Despite this, surprisingly, Incyte saw an exceptional 34% net income growth over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Incyte's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 25%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Incyte fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Incyte Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Incyte doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Incyte certainly does have some positive factors to consider. With a high rate of reinvestment, albeit at a low ROE, the company has managed to see a considerable growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

Chriss will replace longtime PayPal CEO Dan Schulman. Chriss will officially join the company in late September. Kraft Heinz (KHC) also announced that its North America Zone President Carlos Abrams-Rivera will take over as CEO on January 1, 2024. Current CEO Miguel Patricio will stay with the company as its Non-Executive Chair of the Board. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the stories.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: It's turning into a day of leadership transition announcements. PayPal has named a new CEO. It's Alex Chriss. He's going to take over the helm from longtime CEO Dan Schulman. That's going to happen at the end of September. Chriss currently works for Intuit, running its small business and self-employed group during his time there. He oversaw $12 billion-- the $12 billion acquisition of the marketing business Mailchimp. And we've been waiting to find out-- we knew that there was going to be a transition here.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: We just didn't know who it was going to be until they made this pick.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, Dan Schulman, storied executive for many years over at PayPal. I actually got to work on Paypal's transition as a public company after they were spun off from eBay several years ago in a prior life. And ultimately, for Dan Schulman and the leadership and I think who they were looking for, being able to tap somebody that essentially had a lot of the same experiences with the clientele and the client base that PayPal as well in some of their merchants, third party businesses, and vendors--You know, at the end of the day, there's a lot of that overlap in what that client base and what that portfolio of clients is looking for and perhaps having a smooth transition in terms of a CEO that can directly communicate with them and perhaps already has some of those major or similar relationships there. So good news there.And then, additionally, there was another major changeover that we were tracking as well. You flagged this one just a moment ago over at Kraft Heinz taking place where a leadership transition announcing Carlos Abrams-Rivera as the chief executive officer and a member of the board. That's going to be effective January 1st of 2023.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, he's taking over from Miguel Patricio who had been the CEO since 2019. So already, Carlos Abrams-Rivera had been at the company. He's been an executive vice president and president of the North America zone. So you know, he's been inside the company already here. He only, though, joined Kraft Heinz in 2020, so that's something to keep in mind as well. He's also-- Patricio is going to become the nonexecutive chair of the board, so he still will have a role at the company.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, really interesting transitions that we've seen. And you know, for Dan Schulman over at PayPal, this will give him a little bit more time to practice Krav Maga, which we know he's a-- he's big in.JULIE HYMAN: Maybe so. I was looking up the performance of PayPal. As we saw over the past year, it has been not great. The stock has fallen by nearly 40% over the past 12 months. Since he became CEO-- that was back in July of 2015. He's been there for a long time-- the stock is up about 70%. But that compares with a 115% gain for the S&amp;P 500. So it has been up and it has underperformed during his tenure, most of that underperformance or a lot of the underperformance coming in more recent years as we have seen it roll over.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, that was the year of the spinoff that many of our viewers will remember. And it's been interesting to watch them specifically over the past two years because that's where a lot of that fall-off and some of the volatility in PayPal shares but also at the same time where there have been more abilities for consumers to be able to pay not-- and digitally especially. And some of that too could be intertwined with a lot of the fanfare around cryptocurrency as well.Now, PayPal was one of the names that was going to be involved within Facebook's back-then Libra currency. It's moved on since. It's got its own digital currency that they just recently announced. But for a lot of kind of the confluence of events that have taken place, whether that's Apple Pay or whether that's Square beefing up its own businesses in one way or another, a lot of the PayPal efforts here over the past couple of years, it'll be interesting to see if there's a major strategy overhaul as well there.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.]"

DVA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and the acquisition of dialysis centers are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 17.3% against the 11.1% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 4.2% growth in the said time frame.The renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider has a market capitalization of $9.89 billion. The company projects 12.7% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 21.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Q2 Results: DaVita’s solid second-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and dialysis patient service revenues. An increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments was also seen. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock.DaVita Kidney Care: We are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Jun 30, 2023, the company had approximately 64,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses, which own and operate dialysis centers, as well as other ancillary services, is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.Story continuesAs of Jun 30, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 248,000 patients at 3,056 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,703 were U.S. centers while 353 were located across 11 other countries. In the second quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of 10 new dialysis centers in the United States. It also acquired two dialysis centers and opened two dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 8.9% north to $7.08.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.00 billion, suggesting a 1.9% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Cardinal Health, Inc.

This acquisition highlights GE Vernova’s commitment to investing in technologies and talent that help accelerate the sustainable energy grid. The platform will accelerate GridOS®, the world’s first software portfolio designed specifically for grid orchestration, adding new capabilities for connecting systems and integrating data across the grid more easily and at scale. The financial terms of the acquisition are not being disclosed.""Utilities have an urgent need to connect data from multiple sources to gain visibility and effectively automate their grid operations. Fragmented data is a major obstacle to modernizing the grid and is holding the energy transition back,"" said Scott Reese, CEO of GE Vernova’s Digital business. ""The Greenbird acquisition brings the proven ability to connect multiple data sources and accelerates our vision for GridOS that is making energy security a reality for many of the world’s leading utilities. Data and AI are key to helping utilities run a reliable and resilient grid and this acquisition is a massive accelerant to making that vision a reality for utilities of all sizes.""Story continuesThe GridOS orchestration software platform and application suite enables secure and reliable grid operations while delivering resiliency and flexibility needed by utilities worldwide. GridOS delivers these tools with the cloud service provider and system integrator partner ecosystem necessary to accelerate grid modernization and the energy transition. The software portfolio uses a federated data fabric to pull together energy data, network modeling, and AI-driven analytics from across the grid. The Greenbird acquisition will expand the capabilities of the data fabric, eliminating data silos to make it faster and easier to connect and aggregate energy data, reducing the time and expense of data integration projects. This also better connects modern software like Advanced Energy Management System (AEMS), Advanced Distribution Management Solutions (ADMS), and Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS), creating new opportunities for grid automation.""Having access to utility data in context gives grid operators an opportunity to better leverage AI for automation and potentially enables the grid to be self-describing and self-healing in the future,"" said Mahesh Sudhakaran, General Manager, Grid Software at GE Vernova’s Digital business. ""This is the vision we have for grid orchestration enabled by the GridOS portfolio, and this acquisition provides both the technology and the talent to help us get there.""""We started in 2010 with a mission to simplify data integration for utilities, helping them leverage data to run smarter, more efficient analytics-driven services to accelerate the energy transition,"" said Thorsten Heller, CEO of Greenbird Integration Technology. ""Our technology platform is purpose-built to support a distributed data and IT architecture and aligns perfectly with GE Vernova’s vision for the GridOS federated grid data fabric and one network model, providing the data foundation utilities need to transform their operations.""An example of the need for more connected and integrated data is evident in the exponential growth predicted for electric vehicles (EVs) – there are expected to be 77M EVs on the road by 2025 and 229M by 2030 – that will both draw from and possibly contribute to the grid as ""rolling batteries"" that can be tapped when demand is high and supply is low. Integration of data from multiple sources like charging stations as well as operations, forecasting, billing, and other systems can support the success of future use cases such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) while keeping the grid safe.Data integration is also key to solving renewables connection challenges. Approximately 1,350 gigawatts of additional, mostly sustainable power capacity is waiting to be constructed and connected to the grid. This large-scale interconnection backlog results in wasted capacity and unutilized investment. Scenario planning and grid simulations can provide an opportunity to increase line capacity and drive deeper visibility into the impact of such assets on the grid, allowing capacity to be connected faster and helping to reduce hundreds of millions of dollars of traditional back-up generators. Such use cases require the integration of forecasting, simulation, historical grid OT, sensor, line, and inertia data.The Greenbird integration platform is delivered as a service (iPaaS) and is built with containerization and a suite of cloud services, which will accelerate the availability of key GridOS components. In addition, GE Vernova welcomes Greenbird’s innovative team to the Grid Software group, including data specialists skilled in developing and deploying distributed data processes at scale for utilities. The acquisition will advance the AI- and data-driven vision for GridOS that GE Vernova’s Digital business believes will solve grid orchestration challenges while cultivating an energy data ecosystem that advances decarbonization and electrification at scale.Learn more about GridOS here.About GE Vernova’s Digital BusinessGE Vernova’s Digital business is putting data to work to accelerate a new era of energy.

321,329cc7b4-4b01-3db7-9ad0-bcbd042a9a5e,VLO,2023-08-15,Are Strong Financial Prospects The Force That Is Driving The Momentum In Valero Energy Corporation's NYSE:VLO) Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strong-financial-prospects-force-driving-120020283.html,1692100820,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) stock is up by a considerable 24% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Valero Energy's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Valero Energy is:41% = US$11b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.41.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Valero Energy's Earnings Growth And 41% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Valero Energy has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 27% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, Valero Energy's considerable five year net income growth of 36% was to be expected.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Valero Energy's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 27% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is VLO fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Valero Energy Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Valero Energy's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 13% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (87%) of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Besides, Valero Energy has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 44% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 13%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Valero Energy's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

322,ec5f0d7a-cff1-3635-9fdc-b29f79050983,VLO,2023-08-15,7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Income and Upside,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-buy-income-090031670.html,1691571631,STORY,"['PFE', 'VLO', 'PEP', 'SOI', 'PSA', 'KHC', 'BEP']","[Investors buy dividend stocks for a few reasons. For one, they provide income via dividends that act as a bonus on top of capital appreciation over time. It’s always nice to see the stock prices of companies in your portfolio rise. To then get an extra few percentage points of performance through dividends is an added bonus. Second, firms that pay dividends tend to be more stable. They also tend to grow over time in a relatively predictable manner.It’s a simple but powerful combination that has served investors well and will continue to serve them well. What’s also nice is that in these inflationary times, dividends serve to blunt the effects of rising prices.Here are seven of the best dividend stocks to buy, for those seeking both income and upside in this current market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSolaris Oilfield Infrastructure (SOI)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comSolaris Oilfield Infrastructure (NYSE:SOI) is an interesting dividend stock for energy investors.The firm’s most recent earnings report notes that Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure “provides mobile equipment that drives supply chain and execution efficiencies in the completion of oil and natural gas wells.” That’s a bit vague. Those mobile systems deliver proppant which is a solid material like ceramics or treated sand, used to keep hydraulic fractures open in oilfields.Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure’s fundamentals portray a sort of mixed bag. Revenues declined by 10.96% in Q2, falling to $77.2 million. That isn’t positive no matter how you spin it. However, revenues did increase by over 11% during the first half of 2023. Additionally, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure’s net income increased in both Q2 and the first six months of the year.More income means the company can easily continue to pay dividends that currently sit above 4%.Valero (VLO)Black oil barrel that reads ""oil"" on the side in a pool of oil with other barrelsSource: ShutterstockValero (NYSE:VLO) is another energy stock investors should take a look at. Many readers will recognize Valero for its gas stations which are ubiquitous throughout the U.S. However, Valero is also among the largest oil refiners globally, operating 15 refineries across the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Valero has also grown to become the world’s second-largest refiner of renewable diesel.Story continuesThe company, like nearly every other energy firm, has had a wild few last years. Indeed, 2021 provided massive growth for the firm with revenues growing more than 75% to $113.97 billion. Of course, 2022 was even better. The company’s revenue soared above $176 billion, but is generally considered to be an aberration year, given the company’s record profitability. That said, this year Valero should easily eclipse its 2021 top-line performance.There’s nearly $20 of upside beyond VLO’s current share price, per consensus views. Add to that a dividend yielding above 3% that hasn’t been reduced in 13 years, and Valero becomes very attractive.Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) offers investors three things that I’d argue make it a screaming buy at this point: growth, value, and relatively strong income for investors.The growth argument is very straightforward in regard to Public Storage. The firm’s 3-year revenue and EBITDA growth rates are near the 90th percentile within its sector. Public Storage also released strong earnings on Aug. 2 that showed continued growth in 2023.The value argument behind PSA stock is also simple. Currently, PSA stock trades lower than 61% of competitors relative to earnings, suggesting that it is currently undervalued and a potential deal for investors.And then there’s the income argument for Public Storage. The dividend’s forward yield exceeds 4%, which is relatively high. While the yield is relatively high, the firm hasn’t reduced the dividend since 1992. It is precisely the kind of high-yielding, lower-risk option investors should want to consider.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comRecall a recent trip to the supermarket and you’ll understand why PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) is a buy. High prices and high demand for its products have resulted in continued strong earnings for the firm.A bag of chips and a soda costs more than it did in the recent past. However, it hasn’t fazed snackers, with consumers continuing to absorb price hikes for snacks. Pepsi CFO Hugh Johnston notes that snacking hasn’t suffered a demand pullback like higher ticket items have. He characterizes soft drinks and snacks including Mt. Dew and Lay’s as affordable luxuries that remain in high demand. Johnston also notes that these small luxuries are taking the place of larger items as consumers tighten their purse strings.The effect has been positive for Pepsi, as Q2 revenues exceeded Wall Street’s expectations by $600 million. The bonus for investors is that even as Pepsi surges, it continues to offer upside based on share price consensus expectations.Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comKraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) is another food producer stock investors should consider for its dividend and growth profile, although its narrative is different from that for Pepsi.The primary difference between the two is that Kraft Heinz didn’t beat revenue expectations in Q2. Sales grew by 2.6% to $6.72 billion, falling somewhat short of expectations. However, the 79 cents in earnings from the firm did exceed expectations and increased 12.9% on a year-over-year basis.Strong earnings mean the firm can reinvest in its business lines while also continuing to reward investors with dividend payouts. Kraft Heinz includes a dividend yielding 4.5% currently. That’s an attractive proposition for most investors.The company expects organic revenue growth in the range of 4-6% this year. In Q2, organic revenues grew by 4%, so it’s entirely reasonable to expect that range to continue to year-end. Kraft Heinz shares sport a beta of 0.67, so it’s a good place to park capital for the purposes of preservation while simultaneously offering dividend income.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comIt’s currently a great time to make a bet on Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The company is undergoing a Covid-19 vaccine hangover. It’s gone from a massive winner to a “what have you done for me lately” story in the eyes of many investors.The pandemic is over, meaning Pfizer’s cash flows from its vaccine have dried up. This led to the company visibly missing revenue expectations for the second quarter. What, then, should logically galvanize investors to put their capital behind Pfizer at this point?The answer is growth expectations. The company has given notice that it will roll out 19 new products or new uses in the coming 18 months. Investors will receive a dividend that adds nearly 5% to their returns for making that bet on the company’s future growth.Pfizer is doing what winning pharmaceutical firms do –  creating blockbuster products, reinvesting windfall revenues into future growth, and developing the next iteration of that growth cycle. Notably, PFE stock is as cheap as it’s been this year. The income and upside narrative is stronger for PFE stock than just about any other pharmaceutical name right now of this quality.Brookfield Renewable (BEPC)Brookfield Renewable logo on a phone screen. BEPC stock. BEP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockBrookfield Renewable (NYSE:BEPC) is something of a hybrid between utility stock and green energy growth stock. The firm owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets that provide income, hence its likeness to utility firms. Meanwhile, it clearly touches on the growth trends the green energy sector provides, and therefore offers meaningful upside.Wall Street certainly believes that Brookfield Renewable will provide meaningful upside to investors. The consensus price target  analyst have assigned BEPC shares is $10 above its current price of $28. Brookfield Renewable provides substantial dividend income with a yield of 4.8%. That combination has kept the firm on the radar of many investors, who may be looking for undervalued income-producing gems.I would note that BEPC shares are inexpensive as well. The company’s price-to-earnings ratio of 3.45-times means that shares are priced lower than 91% of competitors relative to earnings. Thus, Brookfield Renewable is another very compelling growth and income story to consider now.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip a background of what's been going on in this lucrative sector this year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2023. In traditional poker, a blue chip had the highest monetary value and this fact has continued into the stock market as well. Highly valuable and well established firms are often called blue chips, and the term has been used on the market for more than a century now. These firms often earn billions of dollars in revenue, have thousands of employees, and have a global presence that spans several countries.These factors lend the blue chip sector a semblance of stability that can be quite attractive, especially during a period of economic uncertainty. The most widely accepted classification of blue chip stocks comes through the Dow 30 index, which is fitting since it was a Dow news service reporter that originally coined the term in the 1920s. However, if you had invested your money in the Dow 30 this year, the returns would be rather lackluster. On average, the 30 companies in the list have returned 6.49% this year, which is quite low when we take a look at the high performing and technology stock heavy NASDAQ 100 index which is up 38.35% year to date as of mid August, with the returns tapering off of the 45% that the index had returned during the first half of this year.Out of the 30 stocks in the index, 11 have returned more than 10% this year while 12 are in the red. The best performing blue chip stock this year in Dow 30 has been Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is an enterprise technology software and services provider whose share price is sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the ability of the corporate sector to spend. Naturally, its shares had bottomed out from the $254 price at the start of 2022 to $129 by the third week of December as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates and squeezed the budgets of companies at a time when multiple economists and analysts were also predicting a recession in the U.S. economy.Story continuesAugust is also earnings season in the stock market, with the earnings reports for the second quarter as well as forward guidance for the full year expected to set the tone for what's to come as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve has reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. We've covered some blue chip earnings in 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Analysts, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose EPS beat analyst estimates despite a quarterly revenue drop during a time that is typically a slow period for Apple as it ramps up new products for a September launch. Another blue chip firm that reported earnings is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which now expects to grow its 2023 revenues annually by as much as 9% in an upgrade that spelled positive news for the economy ahead.However, not all is well in the blue chip world. One firm that is quite troubled these days is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney made headlines earlier this year when its former chief Bob Iger surprisingly returned to take charge, and recent reports suggest that Mr. Iger might be pulling off a mini Steve Jobs at one of the biggest companies in the world. Apple's legendary co-founder mercilessly slashed out unprofitable products when the firm was struggling in the late 1990s, and Mr. Iger believes that Disney's television stations and channels might not be central to the company's operations.This was also on Mr. Iger's mind at Disney's latest earnings call, where the executive shared that his company is exploring partnerships for the channel. According to him:Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the worst performing blue chip stocks this year, with the bottom of the barrel stocks being Verizon Communications Inc.

325,2e7a3f6e-6d08-37f9-8358-c53943986fba,UNH,2023-08-15,‘The Golden Gridlock’: Billionaire Ken Fisher Sees a Bullish Tailwind Ahead for Stocks — Here Are 2 Names He Bets Big On,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/golden-gridlock-billionaire-ken-fisher-144454755.html,1692024294,STORY,"['BLK', 'UNH']","[Ken FisherThe history books show that the 9 months beginning October of a midterm election year prove to be the most consistently profitable spell in the stock market. Given the stock market gains recorded in the 9 months since last October, that trend played out again as expected.It’s a period billionaire Ken Fisher has termed the ‘midterm miracle.’ The nice thing about that timeframe, says Fisher, is that it is usually followed by another strong period, albeit not quite as fruitful. Fisher has a term for this too, calling it the ‘gridlock gravy.’Why is that, then? “The legislative quiet that follows midterms – whether it’s the president’s enemies who have regained control of Congress, or it’s Congress getting split between two parties – zaps uncertainty around new, controversial laws that always create winners and losers,” explained the Fisher Investments founder. “Political squawking remains, but big bills go nowhere. Political risk aversion falls, juicing stocks.”“As inflation wanes slowly but surely, and as slow growth defies recession fears, gridlock will help keep us in positive territory well into 2024,” Fisher summed up.So, what stocks does Fisher, whose net worth is valued at ~$6.9 billion, think have more juice in them right now? Using the TipRanks database we have gotten the lowdown on two equities he has been busy adding to his portfolio in recent times. And turns out it’s not only Fisher who thinks these stocks are worth a punt; both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s find out why.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)For our first Fisher-backed name we’ll start with a healthcare giant. UnitedHealth is a renowned and diversified healthcare organization that offers a wide array of services and solutions to individuals, employers, and government organizations.The company boasts a substantial presence both nationally and globally and is composed of two primary business segments: UnitedHealthcare and Optum. UnitedHealthcare is a major health insurance provider that offers a range of health coverage options for individuals, families, and businesses. This segment is responsible for the majority of revenues. Optum, on the other hand, focuses on delivering innovative healthcare solutions, technology-enabled services, and data analytics to optimize healthcare delivery and improve outcomes.Story continuesThis is a huge operation, with the company being one the world’s top 10 firms in terms of revenue and the largest healthcare firm revenue-wise, generating $324 billion last year.UnitedHealth is on track to exceed that this year. In the most recently reported quarter, for 2Q23, the top-line reached $92.9 billion, for a 15.6% year-over-year increase whilst beating the forecasts by $1.94 billion. There was a bottom-line beat too, as adj. EPS of $6.14 exceeded the consensus estimate by 16 cents.Moreover, looking ahead, the company narrowed the range of its full year adjusted net earnings outlook from the prior $24.50–$25.00 to $24.70 to $25.00 per share, compared to consensus at $24.7.UnitedHealth has impressed the likes of Ken Fisher, with his firm purchasing 1,548,224 shares in Q2. The purchase brings the total holding to 1,561,174 shares, with a value of nearly $800 million.Mirroring Fisher’s confidence, Raymond James analyst John Ransom thinks the latest print offers evidence of UNH’s strong execution.“Even amid a challenging utilization backdrop, UNH managed to grind out another beat and raise quarter, albeit with the help of the trio of investment income, cost improvements, and buybacks. We believe UNH effectively reset expectations in June, and conservative 2024 bids offer potential upside, while limiting downside if medical cost trends remain hot,” the 5-star analyst explained.Quantifying his stance, Ransom rates the UNH a Strong Buy along with a $630 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 24% from current levels. (To watch Ransom’s track record, click here)Of the 18 UNH analyst reviews submitted over the past 3 months, 2 remain on the sidelines while all the rest are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. Going by the $571.53 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for ~12% premium. (See UnitedHealth stock forecast)BlackRock, Inc. (BLK)From one industry behemoth to another. BlackRock is an American multinational investment firm, and in fact, with more than $9.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM), is the world’s largest asset manager.With its vast array of investment offerings and financial services, BlackRock operates on a global scale, boasting 70 offices in 30 countries, and customers in 100 countries, serving institutional investors, corporations, governments, and individual investors. The company is renowned for its expertise in risk management, innovative investment strategies, and its utilization of technology to enhance its financial services, with many big financial institutions utilizing its Aladdin software to keep track of their investment portfolios.This finance giant generated revenue of $4.46 billion in Q2, and although that represented a 1% year-over-drop primarily due to stock market movements, the figure met Street expectations. At the other end of the scale, adj. EPS of $9.28 fared better than the $8.42 anticipated on Wall Street. In the quarter, assets under management rose to $9.43 trillion, an $831 billion increase since the end of 2022.The company also repurchased shares worth $375 million during the quarter, a move investors always like to see.One of those investors is Ken Fisher, who upped his BLK stake by 6% in the quarter, with the addition of 92,560 shares. His total holdings now stand at 1,934,985 shares, worth more than $1.33 billion at the current price.BlackRock also has a fan in Morgan Stanley’s Michael Cyprys, who highlights the various reasons investors should get behind this name.“BLK’s breadth of capabilities, unrivaled distribution prowess and top brand uniquely position the firm to capture key growth zones over the next several years in fixed income, cash mgmt, private markets and Aladdin technology. This should result in the firm’s $9 trillion of AUM today expanding to $10 trillion in the next few quarters, and surpassing $15 trillion in 5-years,” the analyst opined.“BLK’s scale, diversification, disciplined investments made across market cycles and efficient operations with focus on expenses should support continued organic growth and margin expansion. We also see opportunities for inorganic growth to drive upside, should BLK capitalize on dislocation to accelerate growth, similar to how they’ve executed in the past (e.g., BLK’s $15.2b transformational acquisition of BGI during 2009),” Cyprys went on to add.These comments underpin Cyprys’ Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on BLK, while his $888 price target offers potential share appreciation of 28% for the coming year. (To watch Cyprys’ track record, click here)Elsewhere on Wall Street, the stock garners an additional 8 Buys and 1 Hold, all culminating in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of 18%, considering the average target clocks in at $817.5.

326,13329aad-32f9-3285-9885-a4438bafdd8f,EL,2023-08-15,China's direct impact on U.S. economy is 'relatively limited': Strategist,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/chinas-direct-impact-u-economy-195015486.html,1692042615,VIDEO,"['CTRYF', 'CTRYY', 'X', 'EL', 'CLF']","[China's growth slowdown looms over the U.S. economy after one of the nation's largest property developers — Country Garden (2007.HK) — hit a record low in its stock price. Morningstar Chief U.S. Market Strategist David Sekera outlines how much influence China's economic narrative may actually have on the United States' GDP expectations.""We're looking for 1% GDP growth in the third quarter. Our base case is tight monetary policy [and] decreasing lending will take their toll on the economy, however we expect inflation to continue to moderate,"" Sekera tells Yahoo Finance Live.Following headlines of U.S. Steel (X) rejecting Cleveland-Cliffs' (CLF) proposed buyout, Sekere details his positive outlook for the M&amp;A space — citing consolidation as a key catalyst for markets and stocks — while offering his forecast for retail brand Estée Lauder (EL).Video TranscriptAKIO FUJITA: Concerns mounting in China as our economy continues to run into new issues following President Biden calling the economy a ticking time bomb. One of the country's largest private developers Country Garden hit a record low after reportedly looking to restructure its debt. It comes as another shadow banking giant raised fears after missing payments on several high-yield investment products. For more on what this means for US investors, we want to welcome in David Sekera, Morningstar chief US market strategist.You know, David, it's good to talk to you today. It does feel like those red flags that a lot of analysts had warned about before in China are continuing to pop up even further. You're talking about the real estate market, the debt that's been happening there. And then concerns around shadow banking, which I feel like we've been talking about for years. How are you looking at all those latest headlines coming out in the context of the slowdown that we've been seeing in China or slow growth we've been seeing in China?DAVID SEKERA: Well, the first thing I think you have to remember is that the direct impact to the US economy from China is actually relatively limited. When you look at the amount of exports from the US to China, it's still a pretty small part of our economy. So I think really the impact is going to be mostly concentrated within a handful of companies, specifically technology companies that have a lot of restrictions in what they're allowed to be able to export into China.Story continuesA couple of companies that I'd be concerned about there would be like Nvidia. You know, that's a company that while it has great growth prospects, we think it's just run up too far in price. It's currently rated two stars. It trades at about a 40% premium to our fair value. As well as a lot of the semi equipment suppliers. You know, ASML would be another one where a lot of those restrictions are really going to hamper their ability to export some of their higher end.But really more important with China, yeah, I am very concerned about the weakening in consumption. I know our analysts over there have highlighted that. And as you mentioned, the real estate valuations are at risk. We actually had recently cut our fair value on Country Garden I think it was last week. And we expect the Chinese economy not only is it going too slow for the second half of this year, but we think it's going to be slowing over the next several years.I know we're looking for GDP to slow down to a 3% growth rate by 2027. And, of course, that can have a negative impact on the consumption and economy. And those companies that are most tied to it would be companies like Apple, Tesla, and Nike.SEANA SMITH: Dave, does this that all change the projections here in the US given some of the concerns that we're seeing globally specific here in China. Because at least when it comes to the US as of late, that soft landing has certainly been the dominant market narrative. Is that still intact?DAVID SEKERA: It is. And I mean, that's been our forecast since the beginning of the year. We've always been in the no recession camp. Now, having said that, we're looking only for 1% GDP growth here in the third quarter. And in fact, we do expect that the rate of economic growth will continue to slow sequentially for the next three quarters and won't bottom out until the first quarter of 2024.So again, our base case is tight monetary policy, decreasing lending. All will take their toll on the economy. However, we do expect inflation will also to continue to moderate. We think it's going to drop down. Should be 2% next year in our view. So we do think that by the beginning of next year, maybe even as early as February, we expect the Fed is going to reverse course and start cutting interest rates.AKIO FUJITA: What was that timeline again?DAVID SEKERA: So we'd be looking for the beginning of next year. Probably in February is when they will--AKIO FUJITA: Beginning of next year?DAVID SEKERA: Yeah in 2024. So the Fed could start cutting interest rates. Let's talk about what we got in the news we got in the steel industry today. US Steel soaring on news. It rejected a $7.3 billion buyout proposal from rival, Cleveland Cliffs, and is exploring strategic alternatives. We've got news now that Esmark has announced they have offered a deal to buy US Steel shares.As we were saying earlier, we have seen a big run up in steel prices partly because of the tariffs, but also because of this expansion we've seen in manufacturing coming through from the IRA. What's your outlook in the sector, and to what extent are we likely to see the ripple effects coming from this?DAVID SEKERA: Well, if we're looking at M&amp;A specifically, it has been really slow as far as mergers and acquisitions in the first half of this year. Between rising interest rates, making buyouts more expensive, the funding markets like the levered loan market being relatively tight.We've seen M&amp;A on the low side, but we do think it's actually poised at this point to start ramping back up. In fact, we expect the M&amp;A will probably increase over the next 6 to 18 months. And listening to a couple of the investment banker conference calls, you know, I think they're calling for the second quarter to be the low for M&amp;A.So when I think about it from a strategic point of view, if we're right and the economy does slow the next couple of quarters, that, of course, then leads to slowing organic growth rate. You could see management teams looking for acquisitions in order to bolster their own growth.But then also looking at the private equity market, you know, PE sponsors still have over $1 trillion of dry powder that they're just itching to put to work. And if you look at some of the valuations I know according to PitchBook, you have private equity valuations are still down 20% from their highs. So I think that's all going to line up for a good M&amp;A in the second half of this year and into next year.SEANA SMITH: David, what does that mean for the markets more broadly speaking? How big of a catalyst? Is it going to be a catalyst at all?DAVID SEKERA: Yeah, I don't know if it's going to be much of a catalyst overall. I mean, the market is up over 17% year to date following this strong rally when we look at the broad market. It's only trading at about a 4% discount to our fair value. You know, of course, it was at a much, much lower valuation at the beginning of this year.So I do think looking forward with the economy slowing, I expect returns to be much more muted over the remainder of this year. In fact, I think now is a really good time, especially while things are relatively slow and quiet in August. Take a fresh look at your portfolio. I think now's a good time to start selling. Lock in some of those profits on stocks that have run up so much that they've become-- they're overvalued, overextended.Nvidia would be one that I would highlight. Netflix, Oracle would be a couple that we think are overvalued. And I'd look to reinvest those proceeds. Look for those stocks where they're undervalued, they're unloved, they've lagged the market rally. Two I'd highlight there would be like Medtronic and Kellogg.AKIO FUJITA: What are particular sectors that you think have been overlooked?DAVID SEKERA: Well, the communication sector by our numbers is still the most undervalued sector, even though it's up, I think, about 40% year to date. It's trading at a 20% discount to a composite of our valuations in that sector. You know, Alphabet is still rated four stars even as much as it is year to date. Trades at a 20% discount.But we also still do see a lot of value in more of the traditional names there. Two that have certainly been in the news the past couple of weeks are AT&amp;T and Verizon. Both have seen kind of market sentiment turn against them with some of the lead sheathing and potential environmental liabilities, but we think the market is overestimating those liabilities. Both those stocks are rated five stars. They trade at a 40% discount to our fair value, and they're paying a healthy 7% dividend yield.SEANA SMITH: David, retail is going to be one of the big focuses of the market here this week. We will hear from a number of big names, Walmart, Home Depot, Target among the companies that are set to report. What's your read right now on the strength of the consumer, and whether or not that resilience narrative that we've heard in the past quarters, whether that's going to continue here this time around?DAVID SEKERA: Yeah, I mean, the consumer for the past two years has just been under a lot of pressure with inflation well outpacing wages. That did turn the corner earlier this year. I'm just not sure if the wage increases have really gotten high enough at this point yet to really turn the corner yet. So there's three things I know our consumer team is going to be listening for this week.One, are we still seeing a shift in spending into grocery and away from goods? Are we still seeing consumers trade down into private label from branded label? And are people buying fewer items per trip? And if the answer to that is yes, then I do think that the consumer still is under pressure.AKIO FUJITA: And with that said, any particular names that you're watching in terms of retail? We were talking about the big runs that we've seen with Walmart just given the value play and how they've continued to bring newer customers into the fold.DAVID SEKERA: Yeah. So one I would highlight reports end of this week is Estée Lauder, and I think that's going to give us a good insight into upper end consumers as well as the global consumer. Now, that stock ran up way too high during the pandemic in our view. It did hit a one star rating. It began sliding in 2022, and it's still trending down at this point, and I think a lot of that is just because of concerns on the postpandemic recovery in China has been pretty slow.But at this point, we think that the stock has sold off too much. It's rated five stars. Trades at a 34% discount to our fair value, and our analytical team actually recently added that to our best ideas list. You know, I spoke with our analyst there, and she noted that the challenges here she think are cyclical and not necessarily structural. And she also highlighted for long-term investors, she thinks it has really good growth prospects. Emerging markets I think are about one third of their revenue base.AKIO FUJITA: David Sekera, Morningstar, chief US market strategist. Good to talk to you today.

The rebound in stocks has increased investors' confidence in the stock market's future outlook as they are also investing more actively.This year's investment trend has pushed tech stocks into the spotlight because of the increasing fascination with artificial intelligence (AI). The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has returned 5.34% since the start of the year, underperforming the broader market by a wide margin.That said, dividend stocks are regaining attention once more. Refinitiv Lipper reported that the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF, which follows companies increasing dividends for over 25 years, saw a strong increase of $33 million in investments over a two-week period ending on July 19. This was its biggest gain in two weeks since January.Morgan Stanley has also given a positive outlook on dividend stocks as these equities could enhance overall gains and reduce volatility in a portfolio. The firm's report highlighted that there is a possibility of lower equity returns and market uncertainty in the coming years, which could make dividends a bigger part of the overall stock market gains. Between 2013 and 2022, around 17% of the S&amp;P 500 Index's total returns were from dividends. However, over a long period of time, starting from the 1930s, dividends represented 37% of the market’s overall returns.Also read: Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 AristocratsDividend stocks remain on investors’ radars because even if these stocks don't do as well for a while, there's nothing like steady dividend payments, especially during turbulent times.

To skip our detailed analysis of conservative investing in the current market, you can go directly to see the Conservative Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks To Buy.Markets are jittery again amid analyst firms downgrading banks and some circles still warning about recession despite inflation showing some signs of cooling. At the same time, the US is going through a rough patch in terms of its debt rating, what with the Fitch Ratings downgrading US debt from AAA to AA+, a move that was claimed to be influenced by deteriorating governance standards. The US financial sector is also facing yet another challenge, with Moody's this time downgrading about 11 US banks while taking 16 other negative rating actions on other regional banks in the country. All of these moves have come about in close succession to one another in July and August, putting the everyday investor in a frantic state of mind when it comes to figuring out where they can put their money and be able to rest easy.What Is Conservative Investing?Considering the above, there are many investors today who are looking for safe and reliable stock options to beef up their portfolios and ensure they aren't hit too hard by worrying market conditions. Because of this, conservative investing is a strategy that is coming to the forefront. This strategy entails a defensive investment style with a focus on low-risk investments. The aim of the strategy is to achieve capital security while providing investors with steady and reliable income and protection for their invested capital. Many investors look at reliable dividend stocks as part of this strategy since these stocks offer steady passive income that can tide them by in volatile markets. Blue chip stocks, or generally renowned companies with solid balance sheets and financial strength, are also top picks for conservative stock portfolios.Story continuesWhile building a conservative stock portfolio in the second half of 2023, investors can take a look at several sectors that have been performing well and are expected to continue this level of performance later in the year as well. These include the tech and consumer staples sectors and even the healthcare sector, among others. On August 14, Paul Meeks, a tech investor and portfolio manager at Independent Solutions Wealth Management, was invited to CNBC's TechCheck, and he said the following about the tech sector in particular:""What I've seen is that there were a number of tech stocks that deserved to have big 2023 ramps, and there were a number of tech stocks that probably were frauds that didn't deserve it. And so unfortunately, the whole sector got grossly overbought, and now we're starting to see some reality, we're starting to see some consolidation, and I actually think that consolidation might continue a bit further.""Buying Opportunities In TechMeeks' insights on the tech sector can prove valuable to any conservative investors looking to buy into this sector today since he clearly lays out the ground reality of the sector by stating that stocks within this area have been overbought by eager investors. Despite this, Meeks stated that while tech weakness is expected to continue, he does see a ""buying opportunity"" in some tech names. The mega-cap stocks Meeks is favoring so far include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). He sees further upside for these stocks and several others in the tech sector today.However, conservative investors should keep in mind that tech is not the only sector they can invest in at this point. While it has been overwhelmingly dominating market discourse so far this year, other sectors, such as healthcare and consumer staples, are also equally good conservative plays because of their historical performance and reliability, especially in times of recession. Considering these factors, we have compiled a list of some of the best conservative stocks to buy today. By following lists like these, investors can build up conservative stock portfolios full of some of the best stocks to buy for long-term gains as well. Additionally, these names can also be considered some of the top safe stocks to buy for beginner investors today.Conservative Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks To BuyPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 10 conservative (safe, reliable and defensive) stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc.

This healthy retailer demand has aided leasing activity in recent quarters and helped the company backfill its spaces, which is encouraging.During the second quarter of 2023, Macerich signed 191 leases encompassing 1.4 million square feet. On a comparable center basis, this reflected a 21% increase in the amount of square footage signed year over year.Also, solid demand has boosted occupancy levels at the company’s shopping centers. As of Jun 30, 2023, portfolio occupancy was 92.6%, up 91.8% year over year.With an encouraging leasing pipeline, the company’s rental income growth is expected to remain robust in the coming years, poising it well to ride the growth curve.In recent years, omni-channel retailing has gained popularity and has become the focal point for many retailers. In line with this, MAC’s efforts to enhance its asset quality and grow its successful tie-ups with premium retailers by increasing its adoption of the omni-channel model are likely to have paid off well.Moreover, the company has been focusing on the re-use and mixed-use of its properties through the recapture and repositioning of anchor tenants. In July 2023, it unveiled that its Santa Monica Place will be housing high-end fitness concept, Club Studio. The same will encompass 48,000 square feet and replace the first level of the former Bloomingdale’s site at the property.In June 2023, MAC welcomed the Ireland-based retail brand — Primark — to its Green Acres Mall in Long Island, NY, replacing a former JCPenney site.Further, in the same month, MAC acquired the remaining 50% interest in five former Sears boxes, encompassing a total gross leasable area of 819,000 square feet, from its joint venture partner — Seritage Growth Properties — and now wholly owns and controls each parcel.  The move provides scope to undertake redevelopment opportunities at these properties and enrich them with renowned in-demand retailers.Macerich follows an aggressive capital-recycling program to enhance its overall portfolio quality. Through this, it divests its non-core and slow-growing assets and uses the proceeds for acquisitions, developments and redevelopment activities. These measures highlight its prudent capital-management practices and bode well for growth.The company maintains a healthy balance sheet position and has a well-laddered debt maturity profile. It had around $565 million of liquidity as of Aug 8, 2023. With a strong financial footing, MAC seems well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Nonetheless, higher e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment remain key concerns for the company.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Kite Realty Group Trust KRG and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Horton (No. 120 on the Fortune 500) , Lennar (No. 119 on the Fortune 500), and NVR (No. 376 on the Fortune 500).In total, Berkshire Hathaway bought 5,969,714 shares of D.R. Horton, 152,572 shares of Lennar, and 11,112 shares of NVR. Those shares are worth over $800 million—with more than $700 million of it being in D.R. Horton.While Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett did not publicly state the motive behind this investment, these stock purchases do coincide with a remarkable surge in U.S. homebuilder stocks.This year has witnessed an impressive performance in the homebuilder sector, with D.R. Horton and Lennar up 38.0% and 36.2%, respectively, year-to-date. Not too far behind is NVR, which is up 33.5% this year. For comparison the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 16.3% this year.The driving force behind this growth can be attributed to the fact that new home sales in 2023 have rebounded somewhat, following the sharp pullback that took place amidst last year's mortgage rate shock-induced housing slump.This new construction improvement has translated into new home sales climbing 23.8% year-over-year in June 2023. That said, new home sales are still 32.2% below the cycle's peak which occurred at the height of the pandemic housing frenzy in August 2020.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comOne key reason that new home sales have rebounded lies in the innovative strategies implemented by homebuilders to enhance affordability and attract buyers. Unlike the existing home market, where inventory remains tight and house prices remain sticky, homebuilders have lowered their net effective house prices. These affordability adjustments range from offering mortgage rate buydowns, money back at close, and price reductions on properties.""To address affordability concerns in the market, we introduced increased incentives into the market and adjusted base pricing of our homes where necessary. Our most successful incentive recently has been interest rate buydowns. We are generally offering a point below market on a 30‐year fixed rate mortgage for the life of the loan,"" D.R. Horton CEO David Auld told Fortune earlier this summer.Story continuesMoreover, the homebuilding sector has benefitted from the scarcity of existing inventory available in the market. This scarcity, combined with the aforementioned affordability strategies, has further heightened the appeal of newly constructed homes. The resultant competition for a limited pool of existing homes has pushed potential buyers towards considering new home options, boosting the sales figures for homebuilders.And that housing shortage could last for years.Indeed,  Deutsche Bank recently released a paper that concluded that the U.S. housing market was simply navigating a mid-cycle crisis last year, and the shortage of housing supply would keep builders busy in the years ahead.""It is hard to pinpoint exactly how underbuilt the country is, but I firmly believe we are still in an extremely undersupplied housing market, for both new and existing homes, likely for years to come due to development and construction capacity constraints in the industry,"" D.R.

We got to start with DR Horton, Lennar, and NVR. The reason why these three names are up on your screen is that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway took positions in all three of these companies. We're just getting the details from the most recent 13F filing.We know homebuilders have certainly been rallying here in recent weeks, off to a very strong start to the year. Taking a look at DR Horton, that stock up nearly 40% since January 1. When we take a look at a one-year chart, they're up just about 54%. So Berkshire Hathaway now owning 5.97 million shares of DR Horton, valuing that at $726.5 million.NVR, this is a parent company of Ryan Homes and NVHomes. We're looking at gains there as well, up just about 1% in extended trading. Over the last year, we've seen the stock rally just about 38%. And Lennar has been another winner within the homebuilder space. Certainly, we have seen some outperformance there.Also taking a look at two stocks that Berkshire Hathaway increased their positions with. First, Capital One raised their holding by 26%, now accounting for just about-- just over 3% of the outstanding shares. We're looking at gains of just about 6/10 of a percent.And Occidental Petroleum, a name that has been associated with Warren Buffett, with Berkshire Hathaway, in recent months, given the stake that we've gotten there. And if you can take a look at Occidental Petroleum, the chart that we have seen, since the start of the year, it is up just about 3%. So bucking some of the pressure that we have seen in the wider space.

You can skip our detailed discussion on dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Big Companies that Stopped Paying Dividends. The pandemic in 2020 had a major impact on dividend payments. Global dividends went down significantly, and between the second and fourth quarters of 2020, the total amount of dividend cuts and cancellations reached $220 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson. Many US companies are still struggling because of the losses suffered during the pandemic and haven't been able to bring back their dividend payments. This kind of declines in dividend payouts was also witnessed during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 when dividend cuts resulted in a total loss of $40.6 billion in dividend income.Though dividend payments fell during the pandemic era, the financial positions of the companies became stronger after a few months following the pandemic as they took advantage of extremely low-interest rates and disposable income of consumers. Additionally, higher prices, increased consumer spending on products, and government assistance programs also contributed to their improved financial status. Hartford Funds also published a report on the corporate balance sheets and highlighted that companies started making money after the financial crisis as cash on their balance sheets increased by over three times since the early 2000s. The report also mentioned that the average dividend payout ratio of the S&amp;P 500 companies in the past 96 years came in at 56.3%, but by the end of December 31, 2022, the payout ratio was only 37.1%, which means there's a lot of space for growth.As the balance sheets have gotten better, dividend payments have also increased, surpassing their pre-pandemic levels. According to a report published by Wall Street Journal in June 2023, the total amount of dividends paid out in the last four quarters was $838 billion, compared with $628 billion before the pandemic.Story continuesDividend stocks are facing challenges this year as tech stocks regain their importance. Dividend payments slowed in the second quarter of 2023 due to concerns about a possible recession, earnings, and higher government and corporate debt costs. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices reported that the total net changes in dividends for U.S. common stocks rose by $4.3 billion in Q2 2023, which is lower than the $9.7 billion in Q1 2023 and $17.6 billion in Q2 2022. However, Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, gave a constructive outlook on dividend stocks and mentioned that despite a decline, dividends will remain stable for the rest of the year. He said:“The S&amp;P 500 Q2 2023 actual payment declined 2.3% from the prior quarter, as the index ended its seven consecutive quarters of record payments. Financial dividends are expected to be limited due to the recent banking events and the expected new regulatory requirements, as well as Energy payouts, which remain volatile due to the underlying oil supply and demand issues. At this point, Q3 and Q4 payments are expected to increase with the potential of Q4 setting a new record, but it will be close.”In this article, we will discuss companies that stopped paying dividends in the face of the recent pandemic or other economic conditions.15 Big Companies that Stopped Paying DividendsSource:unsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we searched for companies that have stopped paying dividends due to the pandemic, financial challenges, or cash flow management.

That is the technology that now reflects less fare inventory, according to the ASTA complaint.Story continuesAmerican Airlines said in a statement issued in February that it would “sell differentiated content in new ways that benefit customers. Customers shopping via modern retailing channels will retain access to our best available third-party public channel content.”ASTA said the complaint follows several private discussions between ASTA and representatives of both American Airlines and the DOT. Industry bodies such as the Travel Management Coalition, the Business Travel Association (UK), and FOLATUR have Joined ASTA in the complaint.The filing, lodged with the DOT on July 31, calls for the DOT to use its statutory authority to urge the airline to “restore access to all fares in all channels and to undertake a comprehensive review of the current state of competition in the domestic airline industry.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Just five months earlier, they prepped and baked for the Des Moines Farmer's Market-which attracts around 25,000 patrons each Saturday. Their tent, fees, and basic supplies were covered by the Spark DSM Minority Business Incubator program.Launched in 2022, the program, sponsored by Principal®, supports small minority-owned businesses that operate in the Des Moines, Iowa area. Participating businesses receive help for one weekend of the farmer's market season and have access to education and training opportunities throughout the year.Blooming businesses like these are key to a thriving economy, as small businesses make up 99.7% of companies that pay employees in the U.S.1 Yet not all entrepreneurs have equal access to financial resources and support to get their businesses up and running.""The incubator program provides a great opportunity to eliminate barriers by uplifting diverse businesses in our community and helping them reach new customers,"" says Jo Christine Miles, director of Principal® Foundation and Community Relations.Market to storefrontPrior to opening Good Day DSM in Des Moines' Valley West Mall, Lam was running shop out of a makeshift kitchen in her brother's garage.

But they'd always had their eye on something grander, so when they heard about the incubator program, they jumped at the opportunity.Story continuesThat October, they got their chance. The sisters-in-law spent weeks prepping, baking, and gathering spooky décor to stock their booth at the Des Moines Farmer's Market-and sold out.""It was a great experience and gave us the confidence boost we needed to move forward with opening a storefront,"" Lam says. ""We were able to reach so many new customers and see what it'd be like to sell at a busy market without having to commit to the whole season.""That November Lam purchased her stand in the mall-becoming a second-generation vendor (her mother previously owned a nail salon a few storefronts down). She spent the next few months renovating and opened on Feb. 4, 2023.Since then, business has been humming-selling macarons exclusively on Saturdays and offering signature coffee drinks and sweets during the week. Sure, people miss the macarons during the week, but that hasn't shaken the strategy to only deliver fresh, quality product.""We just do what we believe in, and people have been really responsive to that,"" Lam says.Believing in herself-and allowing others to, tooLam is no novice when it comes to running her own business. Before launching Good Day DSM, she ran a wedding photography business. This time, though, she's all in. And so is her fiancé, who recently left his corporate job to support Good Day DSM full-time. ""It will likely be a pay cut, and we don't have benefits now, and those are things we're working through this first year,"" Lam says. ""But the tradeoff is doing something we really enjoy and spending more time together.""For other aspiring entrepreneurs wavering on whether to take the plunge, Lam says, go for it.""Des Moines is a strong, diverse community for small businesses,"" Lam says. ""No matter what your background is, if there's something you're passionate about, it's worth pursuing.""You don't have to go 100% right away. That's why things like the incubator program are great to test the waters and just see if you like it.""Testing the waters has worked out great for Lam and Good Day DSM. The bakery has already outgrown its stand in the mall and is planning to move to a building across the city late this summer.""We are so excited to make the next space our own and come back even bigger and better,"" Lam says.Learn more about how we support financial empowerment in the communities we serve.1U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), March 2023This communication is intended to be educational in nature and is not intended to be taken as a recommendation. ​Principal community relations supports the communities where affiliates of the Principal Financial Group®, Des Moines, IA 50392 operates.

350,05a173bf-5a1a-319f-b444-88cb3b8281ea,AFL,2023-08-15,4 Stocks to Watch From the Prospering Accident & Health Insurance Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-prospering-accident-160000386.html,1692028800,STORY,"['AFL', 'UNM', 'AMSF', '^GSPC', 'EIG']","[The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry is expected to ride on the increase in underwriting exposure. Aflac Incorporated AFL, Unum Group UNM, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF should continue to benefit from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers’ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claim costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers’ compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates continue to trend downward.Claims Frequency to Improve: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs. Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the degree of severity, the report states.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #37, which places it in the top 15% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

The industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has moved up 14.1% in a year.We present a few stocks one can buy or retain, given their business advancement endeavors.

356,64721779-df09-3458-9717-65a813046a16,PEP,2023-08-15,Boston Beer (SAM) Retains Strong Position on Growth Strategies,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-beer-sam-retains-strong-150600279.html,1692025560,STORY,"['SAM', 'KOF', 'PEP', 'TAP-A']","[The Boston Beer Company, Inc. SAM has been benefiting from innovation and product portfolio expansion. Its advancement in the non-beer categories, including ciders and hard seltzer, should continue to drive progress. We expect its intensified concentration on pricing, product innovation, growth of non-beer categories and brand-building efforts to reinforce its position in the market.The company’s focus on improving Truly brand trends through a renewed focus on the core business, smart brand innovation, and strong distributor support and retail execution bodes well.Boston Beer reported second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the top line declined from the year-ago quarter, the bottom line increased. The performance mainly reflected strong growth in Twisted Tea, offset by continuing challenges in the hard seltzer category.In the second quarter, Boston Beer witnessed improvements in financial performance and volume, bolstered by the timely occurrence of the 4th of July holiday. This positive outcome is a result of the consistent execution of operational plans.Shares of Boston Beer have rallied 8.9% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s rise of 1.7%. Meanwhile, the sector has declined 2.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s earnings suggests growth of 6.7% from the year-ago period’s reported number.Factors to Drive GrowthSAM's focus on innovation to revive the Truly brand and expand Twisted Tea’s potential bodes well. Boston Beer is keen on bringing excitement to the Truly brand’s core flavors through innovation. The company's Truly flavored bottle Vodka and Truly Vodka Seltzer have been performing well. With regard to revisiting the core flavors, the company announced the reformulation and improvement of core Truly flavors, including the addition of real fruit juice for an even smoother, easy-to-drink and refreshing taste.Coming to Twisted Tea, the brand drove most of the improvements of Boston Beer in the second quarter. Effective brand-building campaigns, increased investment in media and additional retail programs focused on the Super Bowl, better distribution of 12 packs and improved service levels have been aiding the performance of the brand. Its growing brand awareness and household penetration also bode well. The company further expanded its light portfolio offerings with a new variety pack available in select highly developed markets, which has received positive feedback from customers.We note that Boston Beer has made successful innovations in craft beer, and hard cider and iced tea categories over the years. The company is on track with growth of its Beyond Beer category, wherein it currently holds the 2nd position. Beyond Beer is growing faster than the traditional beer market. It expects the trend to continue for the next several years.The company is also focused on accelerated cost savings and efficiency projects to aid margins. In the second quarter, its gross margin primarily benefited from strong price realization and procurement savings, which more than offset increased inflationary costs. Also, advertising, promotional and selling expenses declined 3.6% in the reported quarter due to lower freight to distributors on reduced rates and volumes.For 2023, management envisions GAAP earnings per share of $6.00-$10.00 for 2023, whereas it reported $5.44 in the prior year.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeBoston Beer has been witnessing a slowdown in the hard seltzer category and the demand for the Truly brand in recent quarters. The slowing hard seltzer trends hurt the company’s depletions to some extent in second-quarter 2023. The hard seltzer category’s decelerating trend has mainly been attributed to the loss of novelty among consumers due to the entry of several beyond-beer products in the marketplace. Additionally, the decline has resulted from the ongoing dismal macroeconomic environment, which has caused a volume shift from hard seltzers back to premium light beers due to their lower pricing.For 2023, the company expects overall volumes to decline due to continued weakness in Truly volume, which is expected to partly offset strong growth in Twisted Tea. Depletions and shipments are expected to decline 2-8% in 2023. This view includes the adverse impact of 1% due to an additional 53rd week in 2022, while 2023 will have 52 weeks. On a 52-week comparable basis, the company expects depletions and shipments to decline 1-7%.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, Molson Coors TAP and PepsiCo Inc. PEP.Coca-Cola FEMSA produces, markets and distributes soft drinks throughout the metropolitan area of Mexico City in Southeastern Mexico and the metropolitan region in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

357,f8de5e53-2380-33b6-bcf0-9e000114f7f2,UNP,2023-08-15,10 Best Industrial ETFs,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-industrial-etfs-112334666.html,1692098614,STORY,"['JLL', 'CAT', 'BA', 'SAIA', 'RTX', 'UNP', 'ODFL', 'PHM']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best industrial ETFs. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the industrials sector, head directly to 5 Best Industrial ETFs. Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL), an American real estate firm, reported that industrial markets throughout the United States displayed slower performance in 2023 compared to the previous year, given the rising inflation and economic turbulence. Initial leasing data reveals that 112.6 million leases were completed in the second quarter of 2023, marking a significant 46.9% decline in comparison to the same period last year. Even though leasing activity is currently lower than the peak seen during the pandemic, these quarterly results are more similar to the levels before the pandemic. Notably, around 50% of the leases signed in the second quarter were brand new leases, indicating a strong demand for newer industrial properties. The vacancy rate has continued to rise, reaching 4.2%, and with a wave of new properties scheduled for the third quarter, the vacancy rate is expected to keep increasing. Moreover, the rate at which new construction projects are starting has slowed down by 41.3% compared to the previous year, with only 87.9 million square feet of new projects commencing in the second quarter. This brings the total number of projects under construction to 592.9 million square feet.Don't Miss: 10 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To BuyThe manufacturing industry is currently experiencing a significant change as it integrates generative artificial intelligence. AI is being employed to optimize supply chains, improve quality control by identifying defects, and enhance process efficiency. Nevertheless, manufacturers are facing challenges pertaining to issues like job loss, safeguarding data, ethical dilemmas, dependability, and the ever-changing legal landscape. According to Deloitte, the manufacturing sector in the United States maintained its strong performance in 2022, further strengthening the positive trajectory it started after the pandemic and exceeding predictions from the previous two years. Policy measures like the CHIPS Act and IRA are poised to support the ongoing revival of the manufacturing sector. Projections by Deloitte, relying on Oxford Economics' Global Economic Model, foresee a 2.5% increase in manufacturing GDP for 2023.Story continuesAs per CBRE’s market outlook for industrial and logistics sectors, 2023 is supposed to bring moderation in industrial leasing activity within the United States, driven by occupiers postponing their expansion plans and a reduced need to hold excess inventory post-pandemic. Despite this deceleration, demand will remain balanced with supply during the year, leading to a 13th consecutive year of positive net absorption and steady growth in rent prices. The driving forces for this demand include the growth of e-commerce, the evolution of supply chains, and efforts to optimize location choices. CBRE noted that although there has been improvement in global supply chains, there's still uncertainty due to potential disruptions like port backlogs, labor issues, adverse weather, and geopolitical conflicts. To counter these risks, businesses are diversifying their product sourcing, adopting strategies such as a ""China Plus One"" approach, where they expand beyond relying solely on China for manufacturing and labor. On a positive note, larger retailers, occupiers, and logistics companies are likely to continue expanding to strengthen their distribution capabilities despite the overall economic slowdown. However, smaller businesses lack the financial reserves to do so. Also Read: 10 Best Cybersecurity ETFsSome of the best industrial stocks to buy include PulteGroup, Inc.

Current airframe production is running materially below expected travel demand over the next 5-10 years, creating a structural supply/demand imbalance that we believe will drive a decade of strong growth in civil aerospace from here.

Saia has been opening new terminals across the Northeast, and its terminal count has increased from 151 at the end of 2016 to 187 as of Q4 2022. Now that the Northeast expansion is largely complete, Saia is entering a new phase of growth that should unlock additional operating leverage. In addition, we believe Saia has the virtuous opportunity to grow its delivery network at a healthy pace while realizing higher prices as this strengthened network results in higher quality service levels to customers. We are very cognizant of the slowing economy and the likelihood that the industry’s (and Saia’s) shipment volumes will decline in the coming quarters.

358,f05403f5-16b4-3ffd-9398-c0131d617a5c,UNP,2023-08-15,Union Pacific's new CEO promises improved safety and service but big rail unions lukewarm on hire,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacifics-ceo-promises-improved-180126034.html,1692036086,STORY,['UNP'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific's new CEO Jim Vena started Monday by promising to improve safety and service to help the railroad grow, but he cautioned that “the road ahead won't be an easy one.”Some of the Omaha, Nebraska, railroad's biggest unions are already lukewarm on Vena's hiring because he is a strong proponent of the lean operating model UP and the rest of the industry have been using in recent years that led to widespread job cuts. Vena helped oversee Union Pacific's initial implementation of that “precision scheduled railroading” model when he served as the railroad's chief operating officer for two years starting in 2019.Vena suggested more changes are coming at the railroad in a note to all of UP's staff Monday where he emphasized his experience working his way up through the industry after starting as a brakeman, but he didn't offer any specifics. He was hired last month after a hedge fund pressured the railroad to oust Lance Fritz because it was disappointed with Union Pacific's performance during his tenure.“I know you have many questions about what will happen and how it will impact you,” Vena said in his letter. “I share some of those questions, and I will learn a lot from you as I travel the system. What I can tell you is that we will become the safest railroad in the world. I can tell you we will improve our service product, and we will become more efficient and more reliable – for ourselves, our customers, our communities and our shareholders.”The five general chairpersons who lead the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union that represents conductors on Union Pacific said after Vena's hiring that they blame him for much of the deterioration in workers' quality of life because of the changes he made in the name of higher profits.“He orchestrated huge furloughs and cuts to every department in transportation, which resulted in the crew shortages we have yet to recover from,” the SMART-TD union officials wrote in their letter. “Vena put this railroad on a long-term path of destruction for a short-term return on investment for Wall Street tycoons. Watching Union Pacific place this albatross as CEO for the foreseeable future is heartbreaking for those of us who have worked hard to bring Union Pacific back from the brink.”Story continuesThe SMART-TD union canceled several of its scheduled negotiating sessions with the railroad over the next couple months because of the concerns about Vena's leadership and his willingness to address worker concerns.The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union also expressed reservations about Vena's hiring at the time it was announced.Union Pacific is one of the nation’s largest railroads with a network of 32,400 miles (52,000 kilometers) of track in 23 Western states.]"

DGX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by stronger base volume trends and growth from acquisitions. In the second quarter of 2023, Quest Diagnostics’ earnings and revenues were well ahead of estimates. The highly specialized Advanced Diagnostics portfolio represents a key pillar for the company to support faster growth across all customer segments.However, COVID-19 testing revenues and a competitive landscape are concerning for DGX. In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 4.3% compared with the industry’s 11.1% fall and a 4.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned provider of diagnostic information services has a market capitalization of $15.15 million. Quest Diagnostics has an earnings yield of 6.44% compared with the industry’s yield of 4.08%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 4.92%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsQ1 Performance: Quest Diagnostics exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both earnings and revenues in the second quarter of 2023. The robust base business performance reflected the company’s ongoing efforts to partner with health plans, hospitals and physicians amid a continued return to care.The M&amp;A strategy continues to be a key growth driver for DGX, with the integration of Haystack Oncology remaining well on track. The acquisition positions the company to enter the high-growth area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. Across the health system business, the Professional Lab Services (“PLS”) business had a very strong quarter, reflecting growth from new and existing PLS relationships. Further, an updated outlook for the full year boosts optimism while operating in a tight labor market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Base Volume Improves: Across Physician Lab Services, a large number of strategic partnerships with health plans involve value-based arrangements, which are leading to faster growth and share gains than traditional relationships. Within Hospital labs, progress in terms of partnerships with Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health is particularly encouraging in the PLS business, which delivered a strong second quarter.Story continuesIn Consumer Health, the company also recorded strong base business growth on its digital platform — questhealth.com. The initial uptake of the company’s first-ever consumer-initiated genetic health test, Genetic Insights, is promising.The Strong Potential of Advanced Diagnostics: Within this segment, the QuestAD-Detect Alzheimer's blood test is adding to Neurology’s growth trends, fortifying the company’s position in the rapidly evolving Alzheimer’s landscape. In addition, Quest Diagnostics continues to hold growth momentum in the cardiometabolic, endocrinology, infectious disease and carrier and prenatal genetic screening services.DownsidesCOVID-19 Testing Revenues Drop: In the second quarter, the company’s COVID-19 testing revenues declined significantly, leading to lower contributions from Diagnostic Information Services than the prior-year quarter. Further, the year-over-year decline in the top and bottom lines are discouraging.A Competitive Landscape: Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from LabCorp, other commercial laboratories and hospitals. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including the accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, DGX and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs, primarily based on the quality of service.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Quest Diagnostics’ 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up from $8.69 to $8.70 in the past 30 days.The consensus estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $9.16 billion. This suggests a 7.3% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, DexCom DXCM and Penumbra PEN.Haemonetics has an earnings yield of 4.10% against the industry’s -3.18%. Haemonetics’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.39%.

363,cc2fd9a1-21e4-3722-a042-aa794601fe77,CSCO,2023-08-15,Cisco is building a new kind of office for the future of hybrid work,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-building-kind-office-future-122257601.html,1692015777,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Good morning!The remote work wars are still raging, but many workplaces seem to be settling into some kind of hybrid agreement—however fragile.How to strike the right balance between connection and independence, however, has been complicated, and it’s keeping some CHROs up at night. Decreased team collaboration, as well as limited access to work resources and equipment, were among the top challenges to hybrid workers, according to a 2022 Gallup poll. Some workers also feel a type of “hybrid guilt” when they’re not in the office, and worry that in-person colleagues are getting better treatment.Tech giant Cisco is betting that hybrid work is here to stay, and it’s redesigning its offices specifically with those workers in mind. Jeetu Patel, Cisco’s executive vice president and general manager of security and collaboration, says that they’re thinking about the way people treat the office when they do go in—as a way to connect with other people—rather than focus on the work they could be doing remotely alone.“People are going to come into the office for engaging more with each other, rather than going out and getting work done in their cubicle,” said Patel. “We have to reimagine, fundamentally, what the workspace of the future is going to look like.”In the company’s Atlanta and New York City locations, there are fewer offices, and video in almost every room. Employees mostly don’t have designated desks, but there are more “huddle spaces,” or open areas where small groups can hold impromptu meetings. Boardrooms are structured in a “triangular fashion” so that the people working in person can see the people calling in remotely, according to Patel.“If there are five people in a conference room [and] two people are not in the conference room, those two people shouldn't feel like they're second-class participants in a meeting,” says Patel. “They should feel like they have an equal seat at the table.”Patel says Cisco had an “unfair advantage” renovating an office for a hybrid workforce, because it already manufactures teleconferencing equipment. The cost for these renovations was “substantial,” he says, but offset in part by the company’s decision to reduce the amount of real estate it owns, and redirect it towards making the real estate they have more effective.Story continuesThe company is not mandating that employees across the entire business return to the office on specific days, but gives individual teams leeway to decide how they want to work, and strongly encourage employees to come to the office for certain activities, such as for meeting customers.Cisco plans to remodel its offices in most “tier one” cities and “just keep chipping away at them,” says Patel, who believes more companies will start designing for the future with hybrid workers in mind.“I personally feel like that's the area where you will see a lot of movement from companies over the course of the next five to seven years,” said Patel. “Because as these patterns of work start to kind of change, you will want to have modernization of your facility.”Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidionThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?
