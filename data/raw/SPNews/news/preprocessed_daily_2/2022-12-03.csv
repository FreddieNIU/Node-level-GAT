Following a fourth-consecutive 75 basis point (0.75%) rate hike on Nov. 2, it now looks like the pace will slacken. Current expectations are that the central bank will increase rates 50 basis points when the Federal Open Market Committee adjourns in December. Thus, this is shaping up to be an interesting time for those looking for must own stocks in this environment.Still, a lot remains to be seen before the Fed convenes on December 14-15. In particular, November inflation numbers will be released just prior to the meeting. Any negative surprise could quickly change the decision calculus of the Fed, and could potentially lead to another 75 basis point hike. In short, investors should continue to expect an aggressive Fed and plan accordingly. Survival in this environment requires adherence to tried-and-tested strategies. Banks benefit from higher rates, and defensive stocks protect against the downside. Those must own stocks provide a great place to hide in this environment. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTDToronto-Dominion Bank$66.28DGDollar General$252.93SCHWCharles Schwab$80.66UNHUnitedHealth$528.27WMTWalmart$153.18SOSouthern Company$65.43BJBJ’s Wholesale$75.36Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)Toronto-Dominion (TD) Bank logo on buildingSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comToronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) is a stock set to survive aggressive rate hikes for the simple reason that bank profit margins rise as interest rates increase. So, given the expected hikes ahead, Toronto-Dominion Bank should reliably price in this “good news” moving forward. As rates increase, banks increase the interest they charge on loans, thereby increasing income. That has indeed been the case for TD Bank. Revenues were nearly stagnant, increasing slightly from C$10.712 billion in Q3 ‘21 to $CAD10.925 billion in Q3 ‘22. However, net interest income has risen during the same period, which can be directly attributed to rising rates. During the same period, interest income increased from $CAD 6.004 billion to $CAD 7.044 billion.Story continuesTD stock reliably benefits from predictably rising interest income. This results in higher overall revenue in times like these, when rates are on the rise. Therefore, TD stock should remain a strong performer into 2023 and beyond.   Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDollar General (NYSE:DG) stock has had an exceptionally strong 2022. This discount retailer has appreciated in price by roughly 9% through Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 16% this year. The reason Dollar General is likely to continue to thrive is that 2023 rate hikes threaten to tip the balance of the economy. What I mean is that the economy is precariously near the edge. The Fed’s previous moves have yet to produce their intended effects. Thus, rate hikes tend to produce lagging results, meaning a 2023 recession is far from out of the question. Investors don’t need to dig deep into Dollar General’s fundamentals in order to understand why it’s a strong choice. Although the company’s fundamentals remain strong, it’s the macroeconomic situation that makes DG shares equally attractive. In short, consumers are increasingly drawn to the retailer’s offerings because discounts matter.  Sales increased 9% in the previous quarter and aren’t likely to slow down as influential voices continue to predict an oncoming recession. Charles Schwab (SCHW)Piggy bank on a wooden table with stacks of coins next to it.Source: FabrikaSimf / ShutterstockCharles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) stock benefits from many of the same tailwinds that Toronto-Dominion Bank does. Namely, higher rates are proving to be a big benefit to earnings. In fact, Charles Schwab’s recently posted Q3 earnings set a new record for the company. The $5.5 billion in revenues set a record, leading to adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.10, also a record. Wall Street had been expecting $5.4 billion in revenues and $1.05 in earnings. Additionally, like TD Bank, Charles Schwab is experiencing rapidly-increasing net interest revenues. In Q3, those net interest revenues increased by 44% to a whopping $2.9 billion. Another way Charles Schwab can help investors survive rate hikes is through the income it provides from its dividend. That dividend is yielding 1.07% on a forward basis and hasn’t been reduced since 1989. Investors can reinvest this dividend or use it for income. Either way, Schwab’s dividend provides a 1% return that can be especially helpful in tough times. UnitedHealth (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) is a leading healthcare stock, and as most investors know, healthcare stocks are commonly viewed as defensive picks. While financial stocks are attractive in a rising rate environment, economic weakness can blunt any net interest gains. However, healthcare stocks thrive for a different reason. Namely, these stocks’ defensive nature. Healthcare stocks fare well because people require healthcare in every part of the economic cycle. Thus, UNH stock acts as something of a hedge against the worst effects of a downturn. The good news for investors is that UnitedHealth stock still has plenty of room to rise. While many defensive stocks are fully priced, UNH shares have nearly 12% upside based on consensus target stock prices. UnitedHealth has also beaten analyst earnings per share expectations in each of the past four quarters and yet still has $70 of upside. Its defensive nature makes it a reasonable stock in which to park capital in these tough times. Furthermore, its dividend provides additional return beyond any share price appreciation. Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has recently seen a nice rebound, which is one of the key reasons this is on my list of must own stocks to buy. For one, discount retail stocks tend to fare well as economic worries mount. Walmart is the country’s largest retailer by revenue and its discounted prices and strong purchasing power bode well for the company moving forward. During the most recent quarter, Walmart’s comparable sales increased 8.2%. This fact is notable, considering the company is also the largest food retailer in the U.S. With food prices remaining stubbornly high, Walmart should continue to see grocery shopping foot traffic remain strong. In Q3, shopper visits to Walmart increased by 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. Holiday retail sales are expected to grow by 6% to 8% this year, reaching $960.4 billion at the 8% level. Walmart will begin to benefit substantially beginning on Black Friday. The results of those sales won’t be known immediately, but investors should buy WMT stock, as this defensive play should remain strong in most economic scenarios moving into 2023. Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comSouthern Company (NYSE:SO) is an electric utility company serving Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi. Like healthcare, people need electricity no matter how bad the economy gets. Thus, Southern Company is a safe bet to continue to perform well for that reason. The company also provides gas and fiber optic services to its customer base in addition to electricity. Again, consumer demand for those services tends to remain relatively steady, or inelastic, despite prevailing economic conditions. SO stock is currently priced around $66. That is quite close to its average consensus target price of $68. That would seem to suggest that inventors hold off until there’s a lull in this company’s valuation. However, SO shares have traded above $80 recently and current prices likely represent that lull.   Further, Southern Company pays a very healthy dividend with a forward yield of 4.1%. It hasn’t been reduced since 1986, and patterns suggest that it will probably be increased by 2 cents, to 70 cents, sometime next year. BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ)BJ Wholesale (BJ) storefront with red BJ logo on frontSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comBJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) recently reported record earnings for its third quarter. The good news for investors is that despite the strong results, 12.3% upside remains based on consensus target prices. Big box wholesalers including Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and BJ’s have had a strong 2022 as inflation has been particularly hard on grocery prices. As a result, consumers continue to buy in bulk in record numbers. Surprisingly, BJ stock remains far from target prices, which makes its appeal even greater. The company’s Q3 earnings released Nov. 17 were very strong, with comparable sales jumping 9.7% year-over-year. Rising gas prices contributed to those strong numbers. However, even with the effects of gasoline stripped out, comparable sales increased by 5.3%. And while comparable sales, which measure stores that have been open for 12 months or more, increased by 9.7%, overall sales grew by 12.3% in the quarter. This number was even higher through the first three quarters, at an even more impressive 17%. Through the same period, net income has grown by an outsized 20.2%. Accordingly, BJ stock looks to have been ignored this year, which makes it a great buying opportunity. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Texas InstrumentsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Richard Templeton, for US$5.9m worth of shares, at about US$178 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$178. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Texas Instruments insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Texas Instruments Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Texas Instruments. In total, Senior VP &amp; CTO Ahmad R. S. Bahai dumped US$200k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Texas Instruments insiders own about US$175m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Texas Instruments Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Texas Instruments makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments you should be aware of, and 2 of them are a bit unpleasant.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The amount will be paid out on Jan 3, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Dec 14, 2022. Based on the stock’s closing price of $45.15 per share on Dec 1, 2022, it has a dividend yield of 1.33%.This move highlights the company’s sound and stable financial position and its commitment to reward shareholders regularly. Addressing this shareholder-friendly move, PulteGroup’s president and CEO, Ryan Marshall, stated, “This action demonstrates our ongoing commitment to returning funds to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past six months, shares of the company have gained 11.7% compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 15.8% rise.Since 2018, PulteGroup's board of directors adopted a regular quarterly cash dividend policy. It paid out cash dividends of $148.1 million, $135.1 million, $124.4 million and $108.5 million in 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The trend continued in 2022 as well. In the first nine months of 2022, it provided cash dividends of $106.7 million. A solid capital allocation strategy — which is a testimony to the company’s stability amid the prevailing macro-economic woes — drives long-term sustainable growth and shareholders’ value.PulteGroup is also highly active on the buyback front. In the first nine months of 2022, the company repurchased 21.8 million shares under the repurchase authorization for $974.7 million. At Sep 30, 2022, it had remaining authorization of $482.9 million shares.Can PulteGroup Sustain Dividend Hikes?The housing market is significantly affected by supply chain disruptions, intense inflationary pressure, affordability issues and a smaller bond-buying program. The federal government’s actions related to economic stimulus, taxation and borrowing limits could affect consumer confidence and spending levels.The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) recent rate hike brings the central bank’s benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, to a new range of 3.0% to 3.25% — its highest level since 2008 — from a range between 2.25% and 2.5%. Officials expect the Fed funds rate to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2022 and 4.6% by the end of 2023.This apart, PHM’s net new orders in the third-quarter 2022 declined 28% from a year ago. The decrease in orders reflects softer demand, resulting mainly from higher interest rates as the absorption pace fell to 2.0 homes per month, down from three homes per month for the same period last year. Also, it was impacted by a significant increase in cancelations. The cancelation rate for the third quarter was 24%, higher than the 10% in the year-ago period and 15% in the second quarter of 2022.Despite these headwinds, PulteGroup has been banking on an accretive land acquisition strategy and focusing on growing demand for entry-level homes.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPHM currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are CRH plc CRH, Janus International Group, Inc.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Acuity Brands'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Acuity Brands How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Acuity Brands is:20% = US$384m ÷ US$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Acuity Brands' Earnings Growth And 20% ROETo start with, Acuity Brands' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 14%. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Acuity Brands saw little to no growth in the past five years. Therefore, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 11% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is AYI fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Acuity Brands Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Acuity Brands has a low three-year median payout ratio of 6.7% (or a retention ratio of 93%) but the negligible earnings growth number doesn't reflect this as high growth usually follows high profit retention.Moreover, Acuity Brands has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 3.6% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Acuity Brands has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Shares have added about 17.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Qorvo due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Qorvo Tops Q2 Earnings Estimates Despite Lower RevenuesQorvo reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results driven by secular growth drivers in 5G, IoT connectivity, defense and power. Both the bottom line and the top line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, backed by the strength of the business model and expansion of its regional footprint.Net IncomeGAAP net income in the reported quarter was $188.6 million or $1.82 per share compared with $319.2 million or $2.84 per share in the prior-year period. The decline was primarily due to top-line contraction.Non-GAAP earnings in the reported quarter were $276.2 million or $2.66 per share, down from $384.5 million or $3.42 per share in the year-ago quarter. Despite the year-over-year decline, the bottom line exceeded management guidance and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents.Quarter DetailsRevenues fell to $1,158.1 million from $1,255.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to global macroeconomic uncertainty and soft end-market demand. However, the top line exceeded the management guidance and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,135 million.Non-GAAP gross margin was 49.2% compared with 52.4% in the year-ago quarter owing to higher inventory-related charges and planned reduction in factory utilization. Non-GAAP income from operations was $337.7 million, down from $435.4 million.Balance SheetAs of Oct 1, 2022, QRVO had $911.6 million in cash and cash equivalents with $2,047.4 million of long-term debt. Free cash flow at the end of the quarter was $220.4 million. Capital expenditure remains concentrated in areas where the company sees continued demand for differentiated products.Story continuesOutlookFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, Qorvo expects revenues to be in the range of $700–$750 million, driven by continued weakness across end markets and acute inventory correction at Android-based smartphone customers. The company expects non-GAAP gross margin between 43% and 44% and non-GAAP earnings in the range of 50–75 cents per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -69.78% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Qorvo has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,303.9.The company benefited from higher average selling prices across all segments on reduced global supply availability. Supply was impacted by higher global energy costs leading to lower global operating rates and geopolitical factors that disrupted the global fertilizer supply chain.Sales volumes were higher year over year in the reported quarter, supported by higher supply availability from increased production as well as higher starting inventories compared with the year-ago quarter.Segment ReviewNet sales in the Ammonia segment increased around 54% year over year to $531 million in the reported quarter.

It expects high crop futures prices and healthy farm economics to support high corn and wheat planted acreage in 2023 in North America. India is forecast to tender for urea throughout the balance of 2022 and into 2023 to fully meet higher demand as farmers boost grain production. CF Industries also sees urea exports from China to be in the range of 1.5-2 million metric tons in 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -8.07% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, CF has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C.

A stock buyback occurs when a company elects to purchase outstanding shares of its stock, essentially re-investing in itself.There are several reasons buybacks can occur - companies have decided to utilize excess cash, want to limit dilution caused by employee stock option programs, or simply because they believe their shares are undervalued.Three companies have recently announced new stock buyback programs, including Visa V, Walmart WMT, and United Rentals, Inc. URI.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.WalmartWalmart’s product offerings include almost everything from grocery to cosmetics, electronics to stationery, home furnishings to health and wellness products, and apparel to entertainment products, to name a few.The company has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn its latest earnings release (Q3), WMT approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing its existing authorization that had approximately $1.9 billion remaining at the end of the quarter.The company has managed to string together better-than-expected results in a harsh backdrop, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in back-to-back quarters.In its Q3, WMT delivered a 13% bottom-line beat paired with a 3.7% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisaA multinational financial services company, Visa facilitates electronic funds transfers through Visa-branded debit, credit, and prepaid cards.In Visa’s latest earnings release (Q4), the company authorized a new $12 billion share repurchase program and raised its quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.45 per share.Story continuesThe company’s annual dividend currently yields 0.8%, just a tick below its Zacks Business Services sector average. Still, the company’s 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate is undoubtedly strong.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s hard to ignore V’s free cash flow strength; in its Q4, the company reported free cash flow of $5.6 billion, reflecting a nearly 50% Y/Y uptick.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited RentalsUnited Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of rental locations in the United States, Canada, and Europe.Like WMT, United Rentals has seen its near-term earnings outlook turn positive over the last several months, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Rentals unveiled a new $1.25 billion share repurchase program in its latest earnings release (Q3), following the company’s prior $1 billion share buyback that was completed.Further, URI doesn’t carry stretched valuation multiples; the company’s shares currently trade at a 10.9X forward earnings multiple, a few ticks above its 10.6X five-year median and below its Zacks Construction sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI sports a Style Score of “A” for Value.Bottom LineA common way that companies can boost shareholder value is through share buybacks. In its simplest form, the company is essentially re-investing in itself.In addition, it can provide a nice confidence boost for investors, with the buybacks indicating that the company is utilizing its excess cash and not just hoarding it.And in the face of a challenging economic backdrop in 2022, companies willing to dish out extra cash can be hard to find.All three stocks above – Visa V, Walmart WMT, and United Rentals, Inc.

If you want to see more good stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.A good stock to buy is a stock of a strong company that can grow earnings in the future.Although a good stock to buy might decline in the near term, there would be a good chance that the good stock to buy would be higher in the long term given the company's normalized earnings potential and its competitive advantages. Ideally a good stock to buy would trade for a fair or attractive valuation.Many good stocks to buy have historically been leading blue chips that have increased their earnings per share over time. Many of the same stocks make it to the Dividend Aristocrats list where the company has increased its annual dividend for 25 years or more. Many good stocks to buy also return capital back to shareholders through share repurchases. Good stocks to buy are generally less volatile than the general market although there can be exceptions.Given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates significantly this year, the broader market has declined substantially with the S&amp;P 500 down 15% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6% year to date. Many stocks, including good stocks to buy, have also declined substantially as well. As a result, some blue chips with competitive advantages trade for fairly attractive valuations if the economy can grow as expected.Recently, stocks have increased due to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments that the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates at a slower pace.Nevertheless, Powell also said the central bank will still raise rates until it defeats inflation. He added, ""Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.""If economic data fails to meet expectations, the good stocks to buy could decline even further. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesTrump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now, we picked 15 companies with the right mix of scale, competitive advantages, and earnings growth potential.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stocks at the end of Q3 2022.15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now15.

Although the company's earnings might not meet expectations next year if there is a recession, analysts believe JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) will grow its EPS in the long term given its growing market share and its earnings power.Vltava Fund commented on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.Click to continue reading and see 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.Suggested articles:Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksObama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year ReturnsAQR Capital’s Performance, AUM and Top Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
16,be96c9e4-ebc0-365b-ab90-cb642a0c1c45,WMT,2022-12-03,How Walmart and Other Big-Name Stores Get You To Spend More Money,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-other-big-name-stores-230047382.html,1669995045,STORY,['WMT'],"[Klimamarina / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the biggest reason that Walmart is so attractive — and successful — is that they tout mighty savings opportunities. The chain with over 10,500 locations hosts frequent sales, a sweeping clearance section and has their own version of Amazon Prime with Walmart+. But make no mistake: Walmart has a bottom line. They need consumer dollars and they have entire marketing teams devoted to making us spend, even if it means handing over cash on stuff that we weren’t planning on buying. Find Out: 10 Items You Should Always Buy at Dollar TreeMore: If Your Credit Score Is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves NowAnd it’s not just Walmart cooking up ways to make shoppers spend more — it’s every other big-box retailer. Some of the ways that these megastores incentivize mega spending, is, ironically, by offering up legitimately budget-friendly services. Take, for instance, Walmart’s free return policy. That’s not just them being nice; that’s them luring you into buying something in part because you know you can return it without the hassle of an added fee. Keep reading to learn about how these stores encourage you to spend more.Free, No-Hassle Returns Add UpOnce you buy something, are you really going to return it? Maybe. Retailers are cleverly banking on you not. According to a 2018 NPR/Marist poll, 91% of American online shoppers claimed that they “only rarely” or “never” return things they buy online. “The easy return policy at Walmart motivates customers to spend more,” said Sue Hirst, co-founder of CFO On-Call. “This perk encourages customers to shop more. According to research, easy and lengthy periods of return helps stores to increase sales.”And the list goes on. Here’s some other ways that Walmart and competitors like Target and Costco lure consumers into being loyal customers–and (hopefully!) overspending. Take Our Poll: Do You Think Student Loan Debt Should Be Forgiven?Their Tagline Convinces You That You Won’t Spend a Fortune“Everyday Low Prices” — the basis of Walmart’s business model — has quite a lovely ring to it, and draws in quite a profit.  Story continues“Walmart constantly reminds consumers that they have low prices,” said Paul Sundin, a CPA, tax strategist and CEO of Emparion. “Walmart has been promoting low pricing for decades to attract customers. People want to save, so they’ll go for low prices. But what happens is they get too caught up with how cheap the items are; they want to buy more.”They Place Essential Grocery Items Toward the Back or Far Sides of the StoreEver notice how when you pop into a Walmart or Target for essential groceries you have to walk through a sea of other products and displays to get there? That’s no accident. “One of the tactics I see brands with a grocery segment use all of the time is to locate staples like bread, milk and eggs far from the store entrance,” said Benjamin Sweeney, a business development and marketing strategist with ClydeBank Media who has worked on store-level merchandising. “It is counterintuitive: Staples should be easy to grab and located conveniently near the door, right? But, by putting staples far from the entrance, these brands force shoppers to walk past a greater number of displays while heading toward the items they came to purchase.” ‘BOGO’ Is a Consumer Psychology HackAnother common incentive is “Buy One, Get One Free,” or BOGO. Who wouldn’t want to buy something and get an additional product at absolutely no cost? That’s your consumer brain working against you. “Big-box retailers often use what it called psychology hacks to convert more sales: Walmart is notorious for using the BOGO sale hack to increase profit, especially when it comes to their clothing and accessories,” said Kristin Uptain, marketing manager of Redde Payments. “The BOGO discount fools the customer’s perception into believing they are getting a better deal.“For example a ‘buy one, get one free’ would make anyone think they can have two for the price of one,” Uptain continued. “But in reality, this pushes you to spend more, boosting Walmart’s sales each time. Walmart already has a standard sale, this is the sale that their items are set to regardless of the time of year. For example, Walmart’s standard sale is a 50% off discount on a pair of $40 jeans. This sale runs whenever a special discount isn’t applied. The $40 jeans cost the seller only $10. So with a sale like this, the seller will profit $10 if they are 50% off ($40/2 = $20. $20 – $10 = $10).”When the BOGO model is applied, Walmart will earn more profit than they would have if they ran their standard 50% off sale, Uptain said. “You can see that each pair of jeans cost the seller $10, so for two pairs the seller’s cost is $20. But with a ‘buy one get one free’ sale, the customer would need to purchase one pair of jeans at full price to get the second one for free. This means Walmart will profit $20 (after their wholesale purchase price) on this sale which is two times what they would have made on their standard sale. They convince the customer to buy more which allows Walmart to make more per transaction then they would have otherwise.”They Invite Brands To Use Their Stores As a Walk-In AdvertisementEver walked into a store and thought your favorite brand of cereal has bought the business? This too, is no accident. “Basically, stores invite suppliers and manufacturers to come and actively advertise their products in-store,” said Swati Chalumuri, a personal finance expert and founder, HearMeFolks.com. “Known as merchandisers, these sales representatives pull no punches taking over entire aisles, offering big discounts and giving out freebies. Such grand displays and ‘saving’ opportunities are hard to ignore and you end up buying impulsively or getting bigger quantities than you normally do.”Drown Out the Noise By Making a ListWalmart and other big-box retailers invest a lot of money into getting you to spend yours. But you can easily dodge their marketing ploys. All you need to do is make a budget and stick to it by having a list of needed items.“Savvy shoppers create a list and a budget and they stick to both,” said Sweeney. It’s such a simple way to elude sophisticated marketing schemes, but it works — even or especially when you’re in line at checkout staring down those all-too-tempting candies and snacks.More From GOBankingRatesFood Stamps Schedule: When Can I Anticipate December 2022 SNAP Payments?GOBankingRates' Best Credit Cards for 20233 Easy Tips to Turn Your Credit Woes into Wows7 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Walmart and Other Big-Name Stores Get You To Spend More Money]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks.Raymond Thomas Dalio is an American billionaire investor and hedge fund manager, who has served as co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates since 1985. A global macro investor for more than 50 years, Dalio ran his hedge fund for most of its 47 years, building it into the largest hedge fund in the world and the fifth most important private company in the US according to Fortune Magazine. Recently, however, Dalio stepped down from running Bridgewater Associates and announced to remain on the fund’s board and public research team.Responsible for a number of investment innovations, including risk parity and alpha overlay, Dalio believes in taking profits on expensive stocks and then reinvesting. He calls this practice ""rotating the portfolio.""  As of this November, the billionaire’s real-time net worth amounts to $19.1 billion, according to Forbes. Over the decades he has become a valued macroeconomic advisor to many policymakers around the world and was even named one of the “100 Most Influential People in the World” by TIME magazine.One can also measure Dalio's investment expertise by the fact that the flagship Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater Associates returned 32% during the first half of the year due to increased economic volatility, while the broader markets have been left struggling in the wake of global macroeconomic concerns. Some of the premier holdings of the Bridgewater portfolio include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock PicksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur Methodology We scanned Bridgewater's Q3 portfolio and picked top 10 stocks that the fund has been holding over the past several quarters.Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $293.7 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.48%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns CVS Pharmacy, a retail pharmacy chain; CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager; and Aetna, a health insurance provider, among many other brands. The company has been a part of Bridgewater Associates’ portfolio since the third quarter of 2012 when the hedge fund opened its position with shares worth $2.7 million. It represents 1.48% of billionaire Ray Dalio’s Q3 portfolio.Story continuesOn November 21, Credit Suisse analyst A.J. Rice raised the price target on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) to $125 from $117 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares post the company's Healthcare Conference and Q3 inputs.Of the 920 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 67 hedge funds owned stakes in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.14 billion.In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is one of the stocks backed by billionaire Ray Dalio in Q3 2022.Vltava Fund commented on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in a Q3 2022 investor letter, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”9. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $298 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company that operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The company has been a part of Ray Dalio's portfolio since the third quarter of 2020. As of the third quarter of 2022, Bridgewater Associates increased its position in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) by 11%. Ray Dalio's hedge fund owns over 3 million shares in the company, with a total value of over $298 million.Barclays analyst Matt Miksic lowered the price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $114 from $118 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the market reaction to the company's Q3 results returned Abbott shares to early October levels. However, he finds Abbott's performance in Diabetes, EPD and Cardio Devices to be ""encouraging.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”8. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $317.06 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.6%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is a Shanghai, China-based social e-commerce platform with a user base of 900 million globally. The company leverages technology to promote and enable the traditional agriculture industry. As of 2022, 16 million farmers have connected with the platform in China.  At the close of Q3 2022, he reported holding $317.06 million worth of PDD shares. The billionaire added the company to his portfolio back in Q2 2019.Morgan Stanley analyst Eddy Wang raised the price target on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) to $77 from $65 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares after the company's Q3 results beat his estimates on both the top and bottom lines on November 29. Wang expects Pinduoduo's revenue growth momentum to carry well into Q4 based off an easier base, citing greater promotional activity during this year's Double 11.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 54 hedge funds were long Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), compared to 41 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.20 million shares valued at $326 million.Here’s what Tao Value said about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue grow with such a team with strong culture.”7. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $487.73 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 2.46%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald.

According to the analyst, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is placed in an enviable position, where its U.S. business is less reliant on unit growth or remodeling in the face of rising interest rates, and should continue to benefit from a largely rational promotional environment in the wake of the European and FX headwinds.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was a part of 53 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 50 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey’s data. The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth over $1.8 billion collectively.6. Walmart Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Per CNBC, the price of electronics and toys is up 11%, and jewelry is 31% more in 2022, which means savings are a must to not go over your gifting budget.Compare: 10 Inexpensive Christmas Gifts That Won’t Look CheapExplore: How To Successfully Give Pre-Owned Gifts and Other Holiday Thrifting TricksAs GOBankingRates previously reported, there are several best shopping strategies for your wallet such as paying attention to ads, signing up for loyalty programs and skipping on shipping.

Many major brands offer some kind of store perks, whether it’s Kohl’s Cash or My Best Buy Rewards.This means that, basically, for every dollar you spend, you’ll earn points toward a reward certificate to use on a future shopping trip. Apply that to Christmas shopping and that means one big trip for gifts will pay towards another trip to finalize your list. Here’s how it works at six of the biggest retailers:1. Kohl’s CashThe popular chain gives out Kohl’s Cash for every dollar spent during a qualifying period. You can earn $10 to use again at the store for every $50 you spend, which can really add up. The current period to shop and accumulate Kohl’s Cash runs through Dec. 7, and then you can redeem the reward dollars from Dec. 8-18 — just in time for last-minute holiday shopping. So, if you buy $200 in gifts now, you’ll get $40 Kohl’s cash to use in a couple weeks for another gift for someone on your list.Also check out: Target Circle Rewards is offering 1% back on qualifying purchases.2. Ulta Ultamate RewardsWho wouldn’t love a nice bottle of perfume or a high-tech hair tool for a holiday gift? Ulta has a number of options for the beauty- or spa-loving person in your life. But they can get pricey, with many of those items costing over $100. If you enroll in Ultamate Rewards, however, you can earn points for every dollar you spend. Once you get to 100 points, you’ll get $3 off; 2,000 points will be $125 off — all of which you can apply to another gift purchase.

So buy all your gifts now (like luggage, winter jackets, dresses and accessories) and let the points add up for your next holiday gifting trip.Also check out: Macy’s Star Rewards is providing $10 certificates for every 1,000 points earned.5. My Best Buy RewardsBreak up your tech-related gifting purchases into multiple transactions and you’ll be able to work this rewards program in your favor. Every dollar here nabs a point. Once you get to 250, you’ll earn a $5 rewards certificate.

(NYSE:MMC) sold US$1.5m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-marsh-mclennan-companies-inc-120203713.html,1670068923,STORY,['MMC'],"[The fact that multiple Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesIn fact, the recent sale by Óscar Fanjul Martín was the biggest sale of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$174. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 6.7% of Óscar Fanjul Martín's stake.In the last year Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies. In total, Independent Director Óscar Fanjul Martín dumped US$1.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$210m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.But note: Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies may not be the best stock to buy.

And if the U.S. were to reach the finals and win it all, sportsbook operators stand to lose even more.“An 8-figure liability staring us in the face is ominous, but I'm not going to get worried about it at least for another few matches,” Adam Pullen, assistant director of trading at Caesars Sportsbook, told Yahoo Finance.Team USA, which entered the World Cup as a long shot to win, is currently four wins away from capturing the title.USA fans before a group stage match against Iran during the 2022 World Cup at Al Thumama Stadium in Qatar on November 29, 2022. (Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports)'Nobody wants to be in a deep negative'Caesars’ pre-tournament odds for the U.S. winning the World Cup were roughly 100 to 1, meaning that a $10 pre-tournament wager on Team USA would fetch $1,000 in winnings. One New York bettor placed a $5,000 wager on those odds and could net $500,000.These kinds of winners aren’t uncommon in tournaments, as some bettors root for underdogs, but the volume of those potential winners in this World Cup is significantly higher than normal.“Because [the U.S is] the home country, there's nothing like it,” DraftKings Director of Sportsbook Operations Johnny Avello told Yahoo Finance. “Everybody wants to be on the side of the home country, root for them, and get pretty good odds because, remember, the USA is an underdog in most matches that they play.”At least 90% of customers that bet on Tuesday's result at BetMGM (MGM), Caesars, and DraftKings (DKNG) wagered on the Americans. For DraftKings, the match was the most bet-on game and accounted for the most bets on a single team thus far in the tournament.Sportsbooks aren’t surprised by the liability, though. In fact, Pullen said, it’s expected when the U.S. is in the tournament, and operators aren’t scared of the potentially large bill looming either.Story continues“If the general public is going to bet USA, that's fine,” Avello said. “And if USA wins the whole thing, we're going to take a bat. And that's fine too because that means that an underdog won this whole thing and the home country of course.”“Nobody wants to be in a deep negative,” he added, “but hey, that's what we're in the business for.”Christian Pulisic of the U.S. scores the first goal against Iran on November 29, 2022 in Doha, Qatar in the World Cup.

With football and basketball in full swing, USMNT participation helps keep the World Cup in news headlines and at the forefront of bettors' minds, therefore driving up the amount bet on the tournament.Beynon noted that the amount placed on a U.S. win is roughly equivalent to a week’s worth of NBA action.So while the potential payout for the U.S. winning the World Cup is large, the individual matches along the way haven’t added up to significant losses yet for sports betting operators.“While you’re giving a little bit up, it’s not like it’s a Super Bowl event over and over again,” Beynon said. “It’s just one game where you’re getting this extra inflow.”Josh is a reporter and producer for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

The upside was primarily driven by the rise in Casino, BetMGM and other sports betting and iGaming revenues.MGM ChinaMGM China's net revenues fell 69.7% year over year to $87.5 million. The downside was mainly due to COVID-19-related property closures and restrictions. VIP Table Games turnover declined 82% year over year to $328 million. MGM China casino revenues decreased 72% year over year to $70 million.MGM China's adjusted property EBITDAR (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs) amounted to ($70) million against the adjusted property EBITDAR of $7 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Domestic OperationsNet revenues at Las Vegas Strip Resorts during the third quarter were $ 2,301 million, up 66.6% year over year.

Shares have added about 4.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MetLife due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.MetLife Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates on Strong Volume GrowthMetLife reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted operating earnings of $1.21 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. However, the bottom line declined 49% year over year.Adjusted operating revenues of MetLife amounted to $23,690 million, which increased from $17,087 million in the year-ago quarter. The top line surpassed the consensus mark by 19.1%.The better-than-expected third-quarter results were driven by volume growth across segments, solid contributions from the Latin America segment and increased interest rates aiding core spreads. However, the upside was partly offset by reduced private equity returns and increased expenses.Behind the HeadlinesAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfer (PRT), were $11,061 million, down 3% year over year. Adjusted net investment income fell 27% year over year to $4,163 million in the quarter under review, primarily due to reduced variable investment income stemming from decreased private equity returns.Total expenses of $21,851 million increased from $14,863 million a year ago, due to higher policyholder benefits and claims. The adjusted expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses and PRT, increased 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.1%.Net income plunged 78% year over year to $331 million due to derivative and investment losses. Adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, deteriorated 810 bps year over year to 8.9%.Story continuesSegmental PerformancesU.S.: The segment reported adjusted earnings of $744 million, which declined 17% year over year in the third quarter due to reduced variable investment income.

Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT of $6,500 million, climbed 1% year over year.Asia: Adjusted earnings in the segment amounted to $197 million, which fell 65% year over year in the quarter under review and missed the consensus mark of $418.4 million, due to reduced variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by volume growth. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues declined 14% year over year to $1,789 million in the third quarter.Latin America: Adjusted earnings of $171 million increased significantly from $29 million a year ago and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $150.5 million, due to lower claims regarding COVID-19, volume growth and increased interest margins stemming from the inflation in Chile. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues advanced 14% or 21% on a cc basis year over year to $1,123 million in the segment, due to growing sales.EMEA: The segment’s adjusted earnings were $60 million, which plunged 36% year over year in the third quarter, but beat the consensus mark of $59 million. At cc, adjusted earnings fell 20% year over year due to less favorable underwriting. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues of $545 million declined 19% year over year.

Despite a choppy market, attributable to Fed’s hawkish move, concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a stronger dollar, the insurance industry has been gathering steam banking on solid fundamentals.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry has gained 0.9% year to date. Players like MetLife Inc. MET, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG, MGIC Investment Corporation MTG and Radian Group Inc. (RDN), who have an impressive dividend history, continue to offer a stable income.By virtue of the nature of their business, multiline insurers stand to benefit from a diversified portfolio, which, in turn, lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Also, an increase in the exposure of intangibles and an increase in cyber threats offers room for growth for non-life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about six-fold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report.The Fed’s strategic move to hike interest rates to curb inflation has been benefiting the insurance industry as insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. The Fed has already raised rates six times this year. Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, the higher the rates, the better the investment results. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level aids insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Story continuesDividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity. Regular dividend hikes reflect confidence in operational strength, which, in turn, fuel earnings power.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected five multiline insurers that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), a dividend yield of more than 2% as well as a five-year historical dividend growth rate of more than 2%. These stocks have a payout ratio of less than 60, reflecting enough room for future dividend increases. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Radian Group, with a market capitalization of $3 billion, is a credit enhancement company, which supports homebuyers, mortgage lenders, loan servicers and investors with a suite of private mortgage insurance and related risk-management products and services.RDN witnessed five-year annualized dividend growth of 248.4%. Riding on continued financial strength and flexibility, Radian declared a 43% increase in quarterly dividends in the first quarter of 2022, which translated into the highest dividend yield in the private MI industry.

RDN remains focused on improving its mortgage insurance portfolio, the main catalyst of long-term earnings growth. For 2022, Radian estimates total mortgage originations to be nearly $3 trillion, reflecting an 8% increase in purchase originations and a 58% decrease in refinance activity. Also, given the strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured, we expect the company to see fewer claims than before. Radian Group maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows. A strong capital position helps this Zacks Rank #2 insurer deploy capital via share repurchases and dividend hikes that enhance shareholders’ value.MGIC Investment, with a market capitalization of $4.1 billion, engages in the insurance underwriting and related services business primarily in the United States and Canada.MTG has an impressive dividend history, banking on a solid capital position. The largest private mortgage insurer in the United States increased dividends three times in the last five years. Its dividend yield of 2.9% betters the industry average of 2.5%.

PRU remains focused on investing in businesses to expand its addressable market and to continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. Prudential envisions about a 65% free cash flow ratio of earnings and about two times its dividend.The Hartford Financial, with a market capitalization of $24.1 billion, is one of the major multi-line insurance and investment companies in the country, providing investment products, group life and group disability insurance, property and casualty insurance and mutual funds in the United States.HIG increased its dividend at a five-year CAGR of 8.7%.

This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.Such high-quality stocks this season include Tap Genmab, KnowBe4, UserTesting, Enphase Energy and Gartner.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn't tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company's Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.Meanwhile, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies' financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company's guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company's own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks That Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors' dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.Story continuesAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company's ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Here are five out of six stocks:Genmab : Genmab A/S is a biotechnology company. It specializes in the development of antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of GMAB for the past four quarters is 66.61%.KnowBe4 : The Zacks Rank #1 company is a provider of a security awareness platform.The average earnings surprise of KNBE for the past four quarters is 216.67%.UserTesting : The Zacks Rank #2 company has pioneered a video-first, enterprise-grade SaaS platform, which enables organizations to execute customer-centric visions by seeing and hearing the experiences of real people as they engage with products, designs, apps, processes, concepts or brands.The average earnings surprise of USER for the past four quarters is 36.85%.Enphase Energy : Zacks Rank #1 Enphase Energy is a global energy technology company that delivers energy management technology for the solar industry.The average earnings surprise of ENPH for the past four quarters is 21.76%.Gartner : Zacks Rank #2 Gartner is reportedly the world's leading information technology research and advisory firm.The average earnings surprise of IT for the past four quarters is 27.07%.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

For the week though, it was up 3.1%.The spot price of gold, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, remained just below the $1,800 mark, however, trading at $1,799.03 an ounce by 15:20 ET (20:20 GMT).If spot gold did not go too far below $1,800 after the November jobs report, then it “can extend [the] rally towards $1,821 and $1,842”, Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com said in the preview issued by Investing.com on Friday.After 15 weeks of being trapped in the claws of $1,700 pricing or lower, both COMEX and spot gold broke free to hit a 5-month high above $1,800 an ounce on Thursday as easing U.S. inflation and jobs growth pointed to the likelihood of smaller Fed rate hikes from this month.The United States added 263,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said Friday in its non-farm payrolls report. It was the smallest employment growth in a month since February 2021 but still more than 30% above forecast levels that proved the tough job the country had in cooling a runaway jobs market that was feeding inflation.Story continuesNovember’s jobs growth came in a shade higher than October’s 261,000, and strongly above the 200,000 forecast by economists. The unemployment rate, however, remained unchanged at 3.7%. The Fed defines a jobless rate of 4% or below as maximum employment.The Fed aims to ensure optimum job opportunities for Americans while keeping inflation at or around 2% per annum. While it has done exceedingly well on its first target, it is struggling with the second as the Consumer Price Index expanded at a rate of 7.7% in the year to October.The central bank has identified the dynamic jobs market and non-stop growth in average hourly earnings of Americans as among reasons for such high inflation and has been trying to curb both with aggressive interest rate hikes.The Fed has added 375 basis points to rates since March. Prior to that, rates peaked at just 25 basis points, as the central bank slashed them to nearly zero after the global outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the central bank could start slowing down the pace of U.S. rate hikes as early as December but won’t stop its monetary tightening as inflation was still growing way above levels it desired.After four straight jumbo-sized hikes of 75 basis points between June and November, markets expect the Fed to impose a smaller increase of 50 basis points at its upcoming rate decision on December 14.But with November’s non-farm payrolls growth again coming in some 32% higher than forecast, some economists wondered how comfortable the Fed would be in dropping the pace of its rate hikes.“The wages number is a concern and could stoke second-round effects on inflation,” economist Adam Button said in a commentary posted on the ForexLive forum.The labor market has been the juggernaut of the U.S. economy over the past two years, spearheading its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Joblessness among Americans reached an all-time high of 14.8% in April 2020, with the loss of some 20 million jobs after the COVID-19 breakout. Since June 2020, however, the Labor Department’s non-farm payrolls report has reported hundreds of thousands of job additions every month, with earnings growth keeping up a steady upbeat momentum too.Related ArticlesGold futures hold to $1,800 despite upbeat November U.S. jobsU.S. to expand solar panel tariffs after probe finds Chinese evasionOil slides on OPEC uncertainty, despite first weekly gain in four]"

The yellow metal rose more than 8%, marking the biggest monthly gain since July 2020 and the first monthly gain since March.As such, investors should tap the rally with the best-performing ETFs over the past month. iShares Gold Strategy ETF IAUF, iShares Gold Trust IAU, SPDR Gold Trust ETF GLD, GraniteShares Gold Trust BAR and Perth Mint Physical Gold ETF AAAU gained nearly 8% each and have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).Annual inflation slipped below 8% for the first time in eight months. The consumer price index rose 7.7% annually in October, after rising 8.2% at the end of September, while the core consumer price index, which strips out volatile components such as food and energy prices, climbed 6.3% year over year, down from 6.6% in September. The data renewed optimism in the stock market about the Fed‘s possibility of slowing its pace of interest-rate increases in 2023 (read: ETFs to Benefit From Dovish Fed Signals).In the latest speech, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that rate hikes could slow as soon as next month. Traders now expect the Fed to increase rates by 50 bps in December, with the rates peaking in June 2023. Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. A slowdown in the pace of rate hikes will provide some support to the yellow metal.The Fed’s dovish comments also weighed on the U.S. dollar, bolstering the demand for gold. Notably, the U.S. dollar dipped to 16-week lows against a basket of major currencies.Further, continued worries over lockdowns in China continued to raise demand for gold as a safe haven. This is because gold is often used as a means of preserving wealth during times of financial and political uncertainty. It usually does well when other asset classes struggle.Here’s a detailed discussion on the five ETFs mentioned earlier:iShares Gold Strategy ETF (IAUF)iShares Gold Strategy ETF offers exposure to the price performance of gold and is designed to simplify tax filings as the fund does not require K-1 tax reporting.

U.S. equity funds saw a $16.2 billion outflow, the biggest since April.Cash funds attracted $31.1 billion of inflows and gold funds added $59 million, BofA added. Government bonds and Treasuries saw a $2.3 billion inflow.In emerging markets, BofA said bonds had a 15th week of outflows, losing $500 million, while equities attracted $1.1 billion of inflows.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Merit Medical has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Align Technology has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). This means that MMSI's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.MMSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 28.22, while ALGN has a forward P/E of 28.64. We also note that MMSI has a PEG ratio of 2.57. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 23.28.Another notable valuation metric for MMSI is its P/B ratio of 3.79. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Shares have lost about 4.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Marathon Oil due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Marathon Oil Reports Better-Than-Expected Q3 EarningsMarathon Oil Corporation reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted net income per share of $1.24, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 and soaring from the year-ago period’s profit of 39 cents. Marathon Oil’s bottom line was favorably impacted by stronger liquid realizations and solid domestic production.Marathon Oil reported revenues of $2.3 billion, which jumped from the year-ago sales of $1.5 billion and came 8.6% above the consensus mark.In good news for investors, the company is using the excess cash from a supportive environment to reward them with dividends and buybacks. As part of that, MRO has executed $3.4 billion of share repurchases since October 2021 and hiked dividend six times in the past seven quarters.Segmental PerformanceThis Texas-based energy explorer’s total net production (from U.S. and International units) in the quarter under review came in at 352,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared to 344,000 BOE/d in the year-ago period.U.S. E&amp;P: This U.S. upstream unit reported an income of $723 million, surging from $305 million in the year-ago period due to stronger production and commodity realizations.Marathon Oil’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $93.67 per barrel were significantly above the year-earlier level of $69.40. Natural gas liquids average price realizations increased 10.8% to $34 a barrel. Moreover, average realized natural gas prices jumped 88% year over year to $7.84 per thousand cubic feet.Meanwhile, production costs were $6.40 per BOE, representing a 39.4% year-over-year rise.Net production of 295,000 BOE/d was up 3.9% from third-quarter 2021. Total U.S. output comprised approximately 56% oil, or 166,000 barrels per day (bpd).Higher year-over-year production from Bakken buoyed the company’s quarterly performance, which was partly offset by lower volumes from the Eagle Ford area. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 90,000 BOE/d, down 5.3% from the level in third-quarter 2021 but output from Bakken was 118,000 BOE/d compared with 107,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, Oklahoma output came in at 54,000 BOE/d, essentially unchanged from the year-ago level of 55,000 BOE/d.International E&amp;P: The segment, which explores and produces oil and gas in Equatorial Guinea, reported earnings of $181 million compared with $93 million in the year-ago period due to higher liquids prices.Marathon reported production available for sale of 57,000 BOE/d, down from 61,000 Boe/d in third-quarter 2021.Marathon’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $74.01 per barrel reflected a 31.3% improvement from the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas and natural gas liquids’ average price realizations came in at 24 cents per thousand cubic feet and $1 a barrel, respectively, the same as the corresponding period of 2021.Story continuesFinancial PositionTotal costs in the quarter were $1.1 billion, $37 million higher than the prior-year period. Marathon Oil reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $1.4 billion for the third quarter, up significantly from $775 million a year ago.As of Sep 30, it had cash and cash equivalents worth $1.1 billion and long-term debt of 3.6 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 24.2.Marathon Oil spent $413 million in capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter and raked in $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow.2022 GuidanceMarathon raised the capital budget guidance by $100 million to $1.4 billion for this year. Meanwhile, MRO continues to target shareholder returns over production growth. The company is targeting production in the range of 340,000 BOE/d to 350,000 BOE/d – essentially unchanged from last year. Further, Marathon expects oil volumes in the band of 168,000-176,000 barrels per day. Assuming $60 WTI, Marathon Oil expects to return a minimum of 40% of its cash flow from operations.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Marathon Oil has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Marathon Oil has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerMarathon Oil is part of the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry. Over the past month, Hess (HES), a stock from the same industry, has gained 0.9%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Hess reported revenues of $3.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +74.3%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $0.28 a year ago.Hess is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +120%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.7%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Hess.

Social Status May Hold the Key, Study SaysThe Xbox maker hasn’t had conversations with the FTC about remedies or concessions aimed at getting the deal approved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing a confidential matter. FTC staff is wrapping up its investigation and is expected to make a recommendation soon, the person added. The FTC commissioners would then vote on whether to file a case.In the event the FTC tries to block the case, Microsoft is gearing up to contest that decision in court, said the person, who asked not to be identified speaking about internal strategy. Bloomberg Intelligence antitrust analyst Jennifer Rie said it wouldn’t surprise her if the FTC files a lawsuit seeking to block the deal, but noted that a court fight would be hard for enforcers to win and Microsoft could prevail -- though a legal battle could stretch beyond the deal’s end date. Microsoft has said it expects to close the transaction by June 30.Microsoft’s other option would be to abandon the deal in the face of an FTC challenge. That’s what the company did in 1995 when the US government sued to block its acquisition of accounting software maker Intuit Inc., with Microsoft saying it didn’t want to contend with a long legal battle.Microsoft’s best chance to win approval to buy Activision is to persuade the Biden administration to accept a settlement in which it pledges it won’t withhold its popular titles from rivals.Story continuesBut Biden’s antitrust enforcers aren’t fond of such agreements -- especially after this month’s Ticketmaster blowup put the spotlight back on a failed 2010 Justice Department settlement with Live Nation Entertainment Inc.The FTC is taking an aggressive approach to mergers, especially when it comes to technology and digital markets, but hasn’t indicated whether it plans to sue to block the deal.In July, the agency sued to block Meta Platforms Inc. from buying virtual reality fitness app Within, claiming that the transaction could eliminate competition in a few market, referred to as “nascent competition.”Microsoft and the FTC declined to comment. Politico reported last week that the FTC is likely to challenge the deal.The US is one of at least three jurisdictions where regulators are raising questions about the blockbuster transaction, which would dramatically alter the video game landscape and vault Microsoft to the No. 3 spot in the global games market behind Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sony Group Corp.European and UK antitrust bodies have raised questions about whether the popular Call of Duty game franchise will remain available to gamers on Sony’s PlayStation console and whether the merger would allow Microsoft to take a dominant role in the burgeoning yet still tiny market for cloud-gaming services.Microsoft has offered Sony a deal in which it would make Call of Duty games available on the PlayStation for a decade, although the companies would need to work out financial terms for that agreement, the person said.The software giant has advised regulators of those discussions, but hasn’t formally made a remedy proposal because the review process hasn’t advanced to that stage, the person said.It doesn’t make financial or strategic sense for Microsoft to keep the bestselling game franchise from PlayStation because more copies of the games are sold on PlayStation than Xbox and because such a move would anger gamers in a way that could have negative impacts for Microsoft. In fact, the acquisition wouldn’t be financially viable for Microsoft if it cut off Call of Duty on PlayStation, the person said.Because of the different stages of the various probes around the world, Microsoft is likely to discuss this step first with the European Commission, which has set a March 23 deadline to complete its in-depth review of the deal.Microsoft is hoping the remedies it offers the EU will suffice globally, the person said. It’s possible that UK regulators could want additional steps from the company, however.The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is currently in the midst of an in-depth probe of the deal after an initial investigation found concerns in the gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming markets.The watchdog said in an October document setting out the scope of its inquiry that it’s concerned the transaction could allow Microsoft to gain outsized market power that would allow it to cut off competitors like Sony. Although Microsoft has promised it wouldn’t do this due to reputational damage to Xbox or Call of Duty, the watchdog said it hadn’t identified “persuasive evidence” to believe those statements.Scrutiny of big tech companies’ dominance has been ramped up by the UK agency since it gained new powers post-Brexit.Microsoft and the CMA will both appear at a main party hearing in mid-December, a part of the UK merger process that will allow them to hash out and test the parties arguments. An interim decision by the agency is expected by January and the deadline for the full decision is March.--With assistance from Emily Birnbaum and Stephanie Bodoni.(Updates to add previous acquisition challenge in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAirbus Is Coming for Boeing’s 737China Is the Wild Card for Global Inflation in 2023The Cult of the Retail Trader Has FizzledThe Viral List That Turned a Yale Professor Into an Enemy of the Russian StateThe Club With a 60,000-Woman Waitlist©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

For example, in May 2021, Bitcoin plummeted 50% before rebounding to all-time highs of approximately $69,000 later that year. Bitcoin is forecasted to conclude 2022 at nearly $16,800, down from $19,500 at the peak of the FTX crisis. If more controversy unfolds from FTX’s bankruptcy, Bitcoin can fall even further. Even ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood, who is a popular Bitcoin connoisseur, admitted that financial institutions may reevaluate their crypto strategies in the short-term because of FTX.Despite the volatile and unpredictable nature of the crypto industry, it still manages to contort some major financial rules, which is slowly but surely leading the world to a modern economy. Although the recent global events, FTX collapse, and Bitcoin plunge have impacted the crypto industry, there are retail traders around the world who believe that buying crypto products on the dip will result in a sector recovery. For example, Brazilian investors are indicating a solid proclivity for crypto even as the global industry is crashing down, with an unpredictable future ahead. Brazilians are trusting crypto assets over conventional financial investment products like equities and precious metals. Data from a November survey by Finbold indicates that 33% of Brazilian investors intend to purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin within the next 12 months. Cryptocurrency ranks as the top investment, followed by real estate at 26%, and stocks took up the third place at 22%.Some of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Our Methodology These are the most popular crypto stocks among the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the third quarter of 2022.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is one of the premier crypto stocks to watch. Baron Funds made the following comment about CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) operates the world’s largest and most diversified derivatives marketplace. Shares fell 13% during the quarter (despite reporting strong average daily trading volume growth of 26% year-over year) due to concerns that EPS growth will slow in 2023 as the rate hike cycle comes to an end. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats, its product breadth and liquidity depth, its durable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures, and tailwinds from the rising rate environment.”9. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational firm that specializes in payment card services. In June 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) disclosed that Abra Crypto Card on the American Express network will transact in U.S. dollars and offer crypto back on any purchase category. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best crypto stocks to buy according to smart investors. Based on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)’s performance to date, the management continues to expect full-year revenue growth of 23% to 25% versus a 25.24% consensus and now stands by its initial full-year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65, compared to a $9.84 consensus.On November 29, Redburn analyst Fahed Kunwar initiated coverage of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) with a Neutral rating. The brand power of debit is declining as digital wallets become popular, contended the analyst, who believes the market underestimates the cyclical and structural concerns pressuring card network stocks.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 68 hedge funds were bullish on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 67 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 151.6 million shares worth $20.45 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.”8. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), a California-based computer technology and semiconductor company, is one of the best crypto stocks to monitor. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced in April 2022 its new Intel Blockscale ASIC, offering energy efficient hashing for proof-of-work consensus networks. Intel Blockscale ASIC will provide the energy efficiency and computing power needed to deliver scalable and sustainable operations. On November 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh resumed coverage of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) with a Neutral rating and a $32 price target. Since his earlier research note on February 18, the analyst thinks Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has seen higher challenges in both the server and PC markets, with server CPU ramps delayed to 2023 and weaker PC demand. While Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is regaining some share in PCs, in the core high margin server/data center segment it continues to expect market share loss into 2023, the analyst told investors.According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 69 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 funds in the last quarter worth $2.5 billion. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 15.15 million shares valued at $390.5 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”7. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a multinational financial technology company that serves the financial services, mobile payments, and point of sale industries. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s Cash App makes it convenient to invest in stocks and Bitcoin. In Q3 2022, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s gross profit outperformed Street estimates on the strength of its Cash App and Seller systems, but was partly offset by weaker Buy Now Pay Later gross profit. On November 16, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev raised the price target on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) to $69 from $57 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst said payday lending is largely significant to Cash App gross profit growth. Payday lending is a short-term boost to inflows, but it may eventually pressure Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s multiple as delinquencies across consumer lending continue to increase, the analyst wrote in a research note. This is concerning given Cash App's skew towards lower-income households, added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) at the end of September, compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), with a position worth $505.45 million. It is one of the best crypto stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund include Wells Fargo.”6. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a digital payments company that offers financial technology solutions under the PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, Zettle, Hyperwallet, Honey, and Paidy brands. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced in August 2022 that users can transfer crypto from PayPal to external crypto addresses for no network charges. In the PYMNTS survey -- Black Friday 2022: High Prices Reshape Holiday Shopping Habits, November 2022, Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri noted that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), an Outperform rated stock, remained a dominant e-commerce payment option.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 126 hedge funds were bullish on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 17.6 million shares worth $1.5 billion.In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the favorite crypto stocks among smart investors. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in e-commerce driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:Top Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Best Cloud Computing Stocks To Invest In10 Best Stocks in Each Sector Disclosure: None. 10 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Microsoft The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$66.0bUS$78.0bUS$92.1bUS$104.2bUS$116.9bUS$126.2bUS$134.0bUS$140.6bUS$146.3bUS$151.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x23Analyst x22Analyst x10Analyst x6Analyst x4Est @ 7.98%Est @ 6.18%Est @ 4.92%Est @ 4.04%Est @ 3.42% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$61.6kUS$67.9kUS$74.9kUS$79.1kUS$82.8kUS$83.4kUS$82.7kUS$80.9kUS$78.6kUS$75.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$768bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$151b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$3.0tPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.0t÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$1.5tThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.3t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$255, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.007. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

It has been capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. lululemon has been leveraging its stores to facilitate omni-channel capabilities, including buy online pick up in store and ship from store. Continued investments to enhance the in-store experience are likely to have bolstered sales and earnings in the fiscal third quarter.lululemon has been gaining from improving online demand. Its accelerated e-commerce investments to ensure a robust shopping experience also bode well. It has been investing in developing sites, building transactional omni functionality and increasing fulfillment capabilities.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management anticipated net revenue of $1.78-$1.805 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The company’s guidance indicates 23-24% year-over-year growth and a 25% rise on a three-year CAGR basis. Our estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.782 billion. We expect fiscal third-quarter adjusted EPS to be $1.94, which is likely to meet the high-end of the company’s guidance of $1.90-$1.95. The company expects a relatively flat SG&amp;A expense rate for the fiscal third quarter.However, lululemon has been witnessing delays across the supply chain, mainly with regard to transporting its products through ocean freight. Incidentally, management has been more heavily dependent on air freight. The ongoing supply-chain issues and trimmed air freight capacity not only induced delays but also resulted in increased freight costs. These factors are likely to have affected the company’s gross margin in third-quarter fiscal 2022.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected the fiscal third-quarter gross margin to be down 50-70 bps year over year. Although the company assumes lower impacts of air freight on the gross margin in the fiscal third quarter, it expects the timing of supply-chain-related expenses and the normalized markdowns in the quarter compared with the prior-year quarter to hurt the results.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for lululemon this season.

72,b92b2081-47e3-3003-9f9a-0d4d072f72d6,ADM,2022-12-03,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-archer-daniels-140002829.html,1669989602,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -5.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 3.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share, indicating a change of +3.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.40 points to a change of +42.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.33 indicates a change of -14.5% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ADM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For ADM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $26.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $101.63 billion and $100.5 billion estimates indicate +19.2% and -1.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $24.68 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. EPS of $1.86 for the same period compares with $0.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.75%. The EPS surprise was +30.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

73,5cdeddd5-9e6a-3fe7-b738-e09bfac60093,ADM,2022-12-03,3 Momentum Anomaly Stocks to Buy as Markets Await Jobs Data,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-momentum-anomaly-stocks-buy-121512769.html,1669983312,STORY,['ADM'],"[The broader equity indices declined in the past few trading sessions as investors remained wary of the latest jobs data. The jobs data, slated to be released later today, is widely expected to offer cues to the Fed’s rate hike program with key insights into the labor market and data related to non-farm payrolls, hourly wages and the unemployment rate. As the Fed has vowed to continue its aggressive stance to curb inflation, markets await clarity on the future rate hike program and its likely impact on the economy. With uncertainty becoming the norm of the day, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, are the very reason that makes the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM, Dillard's, Inc. DDS and Clearfield, Inc. CLFD are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.Story continuesScreening ParametersPercentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.Zacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or Better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors that include volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are three of the six stocks that made it through this screen:Illinois-based Archer Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

76,8da235fc-9a55-3796-8804-916e82ede535,LUV,2022-12-03,7 Airline Stocks Investors Should Put on Their Christmas Lists,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-airline-stocks-investors-put-152958780.html,1669735798,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL', 'JBLU', 'LUV', 'AAL']","[These top airline stocks to buy are expected to soar, all thanks to a busy holiday season. Over Thanksgiving break, an estimated 55 million people were expected to travel, according to AAA. Then, between, Christmas and New Year’s Day, AAA estimates about 120 million people will travel, with many by air. Thus, unless those millions of people plan on flapping their arms to take flight, that’s great news for airline stocks.Notably, even with sky-high inflation, the American Society of Travel Advisors, about 75% of Americans plan to spend more on travel. In addition, “40% of respondents say that nothing is going to stop them from taking a vacation. Travelers are also eager to check things off their bucket lists in the very near future, with 25% planning to take a dream vacation by March 2023. The pandemic remains a big driver for travel intent, as well, with 70% of Americans looking at travel as a reward for what they have gone through over the past two years.”That being the case, investors may want to consider these top airline stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJBLUJetBlue$7.98JETSUS Global Jets$18.61CRUZDefiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF$17.31LUVSouthwest Airlines$39.22AALAmerican Airlines$14.50UALUnited Airlines$44.42DALDelta Air Lines$35.10JetBlue Airways (JBLU)a close-up shot of an airplane engineSource: frank_peters / Shutterstock.comAfter being grounded by the pandemic, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) is an airline stock that’s poised to take off. In fact, I think if the stock can break above double top resistance around $8.54, it could potentially refill its gap around $10 shortly after.Helping, CEO Robin Hayes said, “We continue to see a very healthy revenue environment with no signs of slowing demand for air travel,” as noted in the company’s third-quarter earnings call. In addition, the company posted a third-quarter profit, its first on an adjusted basis. For the quarter, JBLU posted a profit of $57 million, or 18 cents a share as compared to $130 million, or 40 cents a share last year. Sales were up 30% to $2.56 billion. JBLU is also trading at less than half of sales (0.30-times), and at less than book value (0.74-times).Story continuesUS Global Jets ETF (JETS)The front view of a passenger airplane with a sunset in the background. Airline stocksSource: ShutterstockOne of the best ways to trade any hot sector is with an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Not only do these tools allow you to diversify, but they also allow you to do so at a lower cost.The US Global Jets ETF (NYSE:JETS), for example, currently trades at $18.72 and has an expense ratio of 0.60%. Some of its top holdings include United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE), Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM), and dozens more. If I wanted to buy 100 shares of JETS, it would cost about $1,872. With this ETF, I gain exposure to dozens of airline-related stocks. Meanwhile, if I were to buy 100 shares of just Booking Holdings and nothing else, it would cost me just under $200,000.Defiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF (CRUZ)a picture of an airplane flying with the sun in the background. Airline Stocks to Buy and HoldSource: ShutterstockAnother interesting ETF to consider is the Defiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF (NYSE:CRUZ). At $17.31, with an expense ratio of 0.45%, the ETF offers exposure to companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue from airlines, hotels, resorts, or cruise lines.Also, according to Defiance ETFs, “The pre-Covid travel and tourism industry constituted 10% of the world economy and contributed $8.9 trillion to world GDP. The pandemic has cost the sector an estimated $3.3 trillion; that’s a lot of suppressed demand and growth potential.”Some of the ETFs top holdings include Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United Airlines, Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY), Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT), Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) to name a few.Southwest Airlines (LUV)stock image of the interior of a passenger aircraft. Airline stocks are up again.Source: ShutterstockSouthwest Airlines appears ready for takeoff, too. After bottoming out around $31, LUV stock is now up to $39.22. If it can break above its prior resistance around $41.64, I’d like to see it test $45 shortly after. Better, “While there’s noise regarding whether we are headed into a recession or not or whether we may even be in one now, we have not seen any noticeable impact on our booking and revenue trends,” CEO Bob Jordan said on a quarterly call.The company’s earnings haven’t been too shabby either. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 50 cents, as compared to expectations for 42 cents. Revenue came in at $6.22 billion, as compared to estimates of $6.21 billion. Southwest Airlines is also a top airline stock pick for Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), thanks to its strong franchise and management team, as well as its balance sheet and recovering leisure and corporate travel.American Airlines (AAL)American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flightsSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.comAmerican Airlines is another top option for investors looking for airlines stocks to buy. After finding double bottom support around $12, the stock is now up to $14.50. From here, if it can break above resistance around $15.50, it could see $18.Earnings have been just as solid with this airline operator, as the company posted earnings per share of 69 cents in its third quarter on sales of $13.5 billion. Analysts were only looking for 54 cents on sales of $13.4 billion. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom also sees strong demand.As noted in its earnings release, “The American Airlines team continues to deliver on our goals of running a reliable operation and returning to profitability. Demand remains strong, and it’s clear that customers in the U.S. and other parts of the world continue to value air travel and the ability to reconnect post-pandemic. American has the youngest, most fuel-efficient fleet among U.S. network carriers, and we are well-positioned for the future because of the incredible efforts of our team.”United Airlines (UAL)Inside the airplane cabin of a Delta flight.Source: EQRoy / Shutterstock.comUnited Airlines is another carrier worth paying attention to. After finding double-bottom support around $32, the stock is now consolidating around $44.42. From here, I’d like to see UAL stock again challenge $52.50 near-term. In recent months, CEO Scott Kirby called third-quarter earnings, “the best operational quarter in our history,” as quoted by Barron’s.For the quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of $927 million, and total operating income of $12.9 billion, which was up just over 13% from the third quarter of 2019. Revenue per available seat per mile was 25.5% higher. Better, the company is optimistic about delivering strong financial results in the fourth quarter, and in 2023.Analysts at Cowen have an outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $75. Citi (NYSE:C) analysts also have a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $56. “The carrier’s third-quarter results and fourth-quarter guide looked very strong, with unit revenue coming in above expectations and unit costs well-controlled, even if the carrier did seem to get a little help from a lower-than-expected third-quarter tax rate,” said Citi, as quoted by Barron’s.Delta Air Lines (DAL)The front view of a passenger airplane with a sunset in the background. Airline stocksSource: ShutterstockDelta Air Lines rounds out this list of top airline stocks to buy. After finding support of around $28, the DAL stock is now up to $35.10. From here, I’d like to see it closer to $38.While the company missed third-quarter estimates, it did provide an upbeat forecast for the fourth quarter. The stock was also upgraded to an outperform rating by analysts at Cowen, with a price target of $54. “The mix of air traffic passengers is shifting with higher yielding business and international passengers making up a great share,” they said, as quoted by Barron’s. “The former is directly correlated with the return to the office, while the latter receives a boost from loosening of pandemic restrictions.”On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

If you want to read about some more commodity stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Best Commodity Stocks To Buy Now.Commodities are often split into broad categories like hard and soft commodities. Natural resources are included in hard commodities such as gold, rubber, and oil, whereas soft commodities are agricultural products or livestock — such as corn, wheat, coffee, sugar, soybeans, and pork. Over the past few months, supply chain issues and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have resulted in an increase in commodity prices. A recent World Bank report underlines that there has been a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices. According to the report, this had led to intensifying food insecurity and extreme poverty in many developing economies. Inflationary pressures are also complicating the situation. The shrinking value of currencies of developing economies is driving up food and fuel prices, further deepening the food and energy crises in these areas. Due to currency depreciations, almost 60% of oil-importing emerging-market and developing economies saw an increase in domestic-currency oil prices during February 2022, per the bank. The World Bank report also claims that nearly 90% of economies observed a larger increase in wheat prices in local-currency terms compared to the rise in US dollars. A report shared by IMF in October 2022 says that commodity prices rose 19.1% between February and August 2022. Energy natural gas has increased up to 129.2%, as Russia cut gas supplies to Europe. Base metal prices declined by 19.3%, and precious metal prices fell by 6.0%, while those of agricultural commodities fell by 5.4%. Pablo Saavedra, the World Bank’s Vice President for Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions, says that despite the fact that many commodity prices have retreated from their peaks, they are still high compared to their average level over the past five years. Ayhan Kose, Director of the World Bank’s Prospects Group and EFI Chief Economist, says that the combination of elevated commodity prices and persistent currency depreciation directly relates to higher inflation in many countries. Story continuesHe also added that in developing economies policymakers are unable to manage the most pronounced global inflation cycle in decades. They need to calibrate monetary and fiscal policies and get ready for a period of even higher volatility in global financial and commodity markets, the expert noted. Some of the top stocks to keep in mind considering these macro conditions include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM). Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the commodities sector were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup planning to cut investment banker bonuses by as much as 30%, according to Bloomberg. Some plan to forgo bonuses entirely for low performers. The reason, of course, investment banking revenue, decimated, nearly cut in half at the five biggest US banks, a decline of $18.8 billion in the first nine months of the year.The report suggests more than 100 Goldman investment bankers could be, as they say, zeroed out, get a goose egg, donut, or even a bagel. Yeah, Seana, of course, their slang for getting zero bonuses, a thing journalists have been accustomed to for our entire careers.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I know. That must be nice. But I do think, though, this is part of a larger trend, just in terms of, I don't think it's a big surprise that bonuses are falling. If they weren't falling, I think that would be a huge story, given the fact that we've seen such a decline in their business over the last 12 months. What will be interesting going forward, bringing it back to jobs, is the potential layoffs that we could see within the sector.We know many of these banks typically have annual layoffs at the end of the year, where they cut X amount of their lowest performers, their underperformers. That has largely been suspended over the last two years. A couple of banks have said that they will be reinstating that this year. A couple have said, or there are reports, like Bank of America could be reinstating that next year.But in terms of the layoffs, haven't really hit this sector hard in terms of comparing it to how we've seen in prior slowdowns and in recession. So I think that's the next shoe to drop in this sector, is whether or not we will see more layoffs in 2023.DAVE BRIGGS: And if I could spin that forward as well, curious if the economic impact of those not lesser bonuses-- that's certainly money that gets put out there in the economy around the holiday season-- and beyond that, the IPO market. The IPO market has been devastated. It has been ghost town. Think how much press was dedicated to the Porsche IPO, down 93% IPO activity from 2021. Will that rebound next year? And if so, banker bonuses certainly will.]"

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.MetLife Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates on Strong Volume GrowthMetLife reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted operating earnings of $1.21 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. However, the bottom line declined 49% year over year.Adjusted operating revenues of MetLife amounted to $23,690 million, which increased from $17,087 million in the year-ago quarter. The top line surpassed the consensus mark by 19.1%.The better-than-expected third-quarter results were driven by volume growth across segments, solid contributions from the Latin America segment and increased interest rates aiding core spreads. However, the upside was partly offset by reduced private equity returns and increased expenses.Behind the HeadlinesAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfer (PRT), were $11,061 million, down 3% year over year. Adjusted net investment income fell 27% year over year to $4,163 million in the quarter under review, primarily due to reduced variable investment income stemming from decreased private equity returns.Total expenses of $21,851 million increased from $14,863 million a year ago, due to higher policyholder benefits and claims. The adjusted expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses and PRT, increased 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.1%.Net income plunged 78% year over year to $331 million due to derivative and investment losses. Adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, deteriorated 810 bps year over year to 8.9%.Story continuesSegmental PerformancesU.S.: The segment reported adjusted earnings of $744 million, which declined 17% year over year in the third quarter due to reduced variable investment income.

Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT of $6,500 million, climbed 1% year over year.Asia: Adjusted earnings in the segment amounted to $197 million, which fell 65% year over year in the quarter under review and missed the consensus mark of $418.4 million, due to reduced variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by volume growth. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues declined 14% year over year to $1,789 million in the third quarter.Latin America: Adjusted earnings of $171 million increased significantly from $29 million a year ago and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $150.5 million, due to lower claims regarding COVID-19, volume growth and increased interest margins stemming from the inflation in Chile. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues advanced 14% or 21% on a cc basis year over year to $1,123 million in the segment, due to growing sales.EMEA: The segment’s adjusted earnings were $60 million, which plunged 36% year over year in the third quarter, but beat the consensus mark of $59 million. At cc, adjusted earnings fell 20% year over year due to less favorable underwriting. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues of $545 million declined 19% year over year.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stock earlier this year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hopeful-week-insiders-might-regretting-130052273.html,1670072452,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Insiders who bought US$20m worth of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock in the last year recovered part of their losses as the stock rose by 12% last week. The purchase, however, has proven to be a pricey bet, with losses currently totalling US$3.5m.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Netflix Netflix Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Co-Founder Wilmot Hastings made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$393 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$320). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Wilmot Hastings was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeNetflix is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Netflix Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Netflix insiders own 1.3% of the company, currently worth about US$1.9b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Netflix Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Netflix shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Netflix insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future.

Buckingham Palace also was dealing with a new racism controversy.On Friday afternoon, William smiled as he met Biden outdoors in cold weather along Boston's waterfront. The two men took a brief stroll before a private meeting at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.The pair were expected to discuss ""shared climate goals"" and ""prioritization of mental health issues,"" White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters before the meeting.Later on Friday, William and Kate honored winners of the Earthshot Prize, an award William established to recognize people working on solutions to problems caused by climate change.""By supporting and scaling them, we can change our future,"" William said on stage at the black-tie ceremony, which was attended by English soccer star David Beckham, James Bond actor Rami Malek and other celebrities.Kate and William last visited the United States in 2014, when they were guests of then-President Barack Obama at the White House.Their current trip came just days before Harry and Meghan looked set to steal the limelight at an awards ceremony in New York.For many in the British media, Harry and Meghan have become the royal villains, turning their back on duty while using their royal status to forge out lucrative careers and earn millions, including from Netflix.In contrast, William and Kate are usually portrayed in the British media as dutiful and earnest, reflecting the style of the late queen.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Phillips 66 (PSX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Phillips 66 currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.92, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.92 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 46.2% and 15.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PSXBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PSXCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Phillips 66 here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Phillips 66, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in PSX?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Phillips 66, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 14.9% over the past month to $20.39.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Phillips 66.

(NYSE:TJX) sold US$27m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-tjx-companies-inc-nyse-110059138.html,1670065259,STORY,['TJX'],"[Over the past year, many The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TJX CompaniesThe Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$67.62 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$80.19, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 21% of Carol Meyrowitz's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in TJX Companies than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like TJX Companies better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.TJX Companies Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at TJX Companies. In total, insiders sold US$8.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of TJX CompaniesFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. TJX Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$154m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The TJX Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, TJX Companies makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example, TJX Companies has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is significant) we think you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

95,8cadc013-1628-398f-9e6f-9e142619cced,AMGN,2022-12-03,Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) shareholders have earned a 14% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-nasdaq-amgn-shareholders-earned-140037430.html,1669989637,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) share price is up 64% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 48% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 47% , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 2.8% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 10% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Amgen's TSR for the last 5 years was 91%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Amgen shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 47% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 14% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Amgen   you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

(NYSE:M), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Macy's. Check out our latest analysis for Macy's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Macy's?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Macy's does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Macy's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Macy's is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.1% and 3.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Macy'sThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Macy's, Inc. in their own names. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around US$24m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Macy's. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Macy's  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

We've got a big move that's taking place in reaction in the futures here. Jared, what are you seeing?JARED BLIKRE: That's right. The Dow futures now off about 400 points. More than that right now. You can see on the intraday or intranight price action. This is since midnight, really taking a dive here on that report.Let's check out the NASDAQ, which is now down more than that. Basically, double the Dow, down 2 and 1/4%. Very similar chart right there.And let's just check in on what some of the other markets and the futures are doing. Gold took a little bit of a dive here. You can see now it had been in the green. Now, in the red for about 1%. Interestingly, it had perked up over the last few days.So gold, a lot of people pointing to the fact that it could be on the verge of a breakout while it's breaking out here. That has been on a decline in real rates. But that may be reversing right now.So let's take a look at some of the currency action as well. And in particular, I want to check out the euro because that has been fluctuating around some key levels here. And let me put this on an intraday basis. And you would expect-- yeah, we see the euro weakening and the dollar strengthening on the move.That's as people believe the Fed's longer-- or higher for longer or at least staying the course for a little bit longer. I think that hot wage growth number really putting a damper on equities here.And a little bit tongue and cheek, we've got to take-- check out Bitcoin because Bitcoin has been highly levered to a lot of these economic reports and what the central banks may be doing. Not a lot of action right there.So I'm gonna round this out with a look at copper futures. And then finally, we can see copper heading down as well.And just want to get a check on the interest rate situation. 10-year Treasury note futures really selling off right now, which means interest rates are rising. So a little bit of a hot report there, especially in terms of that wage number, guys.]"

104,31e85944-27b1-4eff-bbdd-bbe6cb25c73b,WYNN,2022-12-03,World Cup: Why sportsbooks aren’t scared of an 8-figure loss if the U.S. goes all the way,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-cup-sportsbooks-loss-us-victory-174230333.html,1670002950,STORY,"['CZR', 'DKNG', 'PDYPF', 'PDYPY', 'WYNN', 'MGM', 'PENN']","[Though the U.S. Men’s National Team (USMNT) qualified for the knockout stage of the World Cup on Tuesday, not everyone wins when America prevails on the soccer pitch.According to Caesars Sportsbook (CZR), the sports betting company paid out a sum in the “seven figures” to Team USA bettors following the match. And if the U.S. were to reach the finals and win it all, sportsbook operators stand to lose even more.“An 8-figure liability staring us in the face is ominous, but I'm not going to get worried about it at least for another few matches,” Adam Pullen, assistant director of trading at Caesars Sportsbook, told Yahoo Finance.Team USA, which entered the World Cup as a long shot to win, is currently four wins away from capturing the title.USA fans before a group stage match against Iran during the 2022 World Cup at Al Thumama Stadium in Qatar on November 29, 2022. (Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports)'Nobody wants to be in a deep negative'Caesars’ pre-tournament odds for the U.S. winning the World Cup were roughly 100 to 1, meaning that a $10 pre-tournament wager on Team USA would fetch $1,000 in winnings. One New York bettor placed a $5,000 wager on those odds and could net $500,000.These kinds of winners aren’t uncommon in tournaments, as some bettors root for underdogs, but the volume of those potential winners in this World Cup is significantly higher than normal.“Because [the U.S is] the home country, there's nothing like it,” DraftKings Director of Sportsbook Operations Johnny Avello told Yahoo Finance. “Everybody wants to be on the side of the home country, root for them, and get pretty good odds because, remember, the USA is an underdog in most matches that they play.”At least 90% of customers that bet on Tuesday's result at BetMGM (MGM), Caesars, and DraftKings (DKNG) wagered on the Americans. For DraftKings, the match was the most bet-on game and accounted for the most bets on a single team thus far in the tournament.Sportsbooks aren’t surprised by the liability, though. In fact, Pullen said, it’s expected when the U.S. is in the tournament, and operators aren’t scared of the potentially large bill looming either.Story continues“If the general public is going to bet USA, that's fine,” Avello said. “And if USA wins the whole thing, we're going to take a bat. And that's fine too because that means that an underdog won this whole thing and the home country of course.”“Nobody wants to be in a deep negative,” he added, “but hey, that's what we're in the business for.”Christian Pulisic of the U.S. scores the first goal against Iran on November 29, 2022 in Doha, Qatar in the World Cup. (Photo: REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay)‘It’s not like it’s the Super Bowl’Investors in the sportsbook operators shouldn’t be worried about large downside risk yet, according to Chad Beynon, a senior analyst at Macquarie covering gaming stocks.Companies and some Wall Street analysts view the first World Cup with widely legalized online gambling as a net-positive customer acquisition moment due to potential new customers drawn in by the event.Having the U.S. in the tournament helps drum up interest, according to the sportsbooks. With football and basketball in full swing, USMNT participation helps keep the World Cup in news headlines and at the forefront of bettors' minds, therefore driving up the amount bet on the tournament.Beynon noted that the amount placed on a U.S. win is roughly equivalent to a week’s worth of NBA action.So while the potential payout for the U.S. winning the World Cup is large, the individual matches along the way haven’t added up to significant losses yet for sports betting operators.“While you’re giving a little bit up, it’s not like it’s a Super Bowl event over and over again,” Beynon said. “It’s just one game where you’re getting this extra inflow.”Josh is a reporter and producer for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

(NYSE:ZTS) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Zoetis could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Zoetis peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Zoetis will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Enough Growth For Zoetis?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Zoetis would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 5.2% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 45% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the eleven analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 10% per year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.1% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it interesting that Zoetis is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.The Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Zoetis currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 1 warning sign for Zoetis that we have uncovered.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:NEE) stock, indicating that insiders' optimism about the company's prospects has increased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider James Robo made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$77.26 each. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$85.20 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. Happily, the NextEra Energy insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.NextEra Energy insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeNextEra Energy is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does NextEra Energy Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that NextEra Energy insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$282m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About NextEra Energy Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like NextEra Energy insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing NextEra Energy. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for NextEra Energy (1 is potentially serious!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.Of course NextEra Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

At the moment, Mastercard stock is only 9% off its 52-week highs and Visa is trading 7% from its highs.Let’s see if a continued rebound is in the cards and check if investors should consider buying either of the stocks.Recent &amp; Historical Performance Shares of both Visa and Mastercard are virtually flat YTD Vs. the S&amp;P 500’s -16%. In the last three months, Mastercard has risen +12% and Visa is up +10% to impressively outperform the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHopes of a continued rebound are supported by both stocks’ historical performance. Over the last decade, Mastercard’s total return is +702% to beat Visa’s +527%. Both stocks largely outperformed the benchmark’s +258% during this period.Pivoting to valuation will give a better idea if the recent rally in these equities can be sustained and possibly provide investors with the stellar returns seen over the last decade.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation Visa has a “B” grade for Value in Zacks Style Scores system with Mastercard at a “C”.Visa stock currently trades at 26.1X forward earnings, and nicely below the decade-high of 44.1X.

However, this is beneath its decade-long high of 55.2X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile Mastercard shares have enjoyed better price performance, Visa stock appears to offer a slightly better discount. The price-to-earnings valuation of both companies indicates there could be more upside in the stocks. Growth Estimates   Turning to growth will help justify a further rebound.

It may be worth holding on to shares as both stocks trade attractively relative to their past.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. The crypto industry is no stranger to volatility. For example, in May 2021, Bitcoin plummeted 50% before rebounding to all-time highs of approximately $69,000 later that year. Bitcoin is forecasted to conclude 2022 at nearly $16,800, down from $19,500 at the peak of the FTX crisis. If more controversy unfolds from FTX’s bankruptcy, Bitcoin can fall even further. Even ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood, who is a popular Bitcoin connoisseur, admitted that financial institutions may reevaluate their crypto strategies in the short-term because of FTX.Despite the volatile and unpredictable nature of the crypto industry, it still manages to contort some major financial rules, which is slowly but surely leading the world to a modern economy. Although the recent global events, FTX collapse, and Bitcoin plunge have impacted the crypto industry, there are retail traders around the world who believe that buying crypto products on the dip will result in a sector recovery. For example, Brazilian investors are indicating a solid proclivity for crypto even as the global industry is crashing down, with an unpredictable future ahead. Brazilians are trusting crypto assets over conventional financial investment products like equities and precious metals. Data from a November survey by Finbold indicates that 33% of Brazilian investors intend to purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin within the next 12 months. Cryptocurrency ranks as the top investment, followed by real estate at 26%, and stocks took up the third place at 22%.Some of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Our Methodology These are the most popular crypto stocks among the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. These companies have deep links to the crypto universe. We have arranged the list according to the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continues10 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Executium on UnsplashBest Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is an American company that runs the biggest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading in several asset classes such as agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes, and cryptocurrencies futures. On November 10, CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) declared a $1.00 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 28, to shareholders of record on December 9. On October 27, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell raised the price target on CME Group Inc.

(NASDAQ:CME) at the end of September 2022, compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. GuardCap Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 4.18 million shares worth $740.4 million. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is one of the premier crypto stocks to watch. Baron Funds made the following comment about CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) operates the world’s largest and most diversified derivatives marketplace. Shares fell 13% during the quarter (despite reporting strong average daily trading volume growth of 26% year-over year) due to concerns that EPS growth will slow in 2023 as the rate hike cycle comes to an end. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats, its product breadth and liquidity depth, its durable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures, and tailwinds from the rising rate environment.”9. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational firm that specializes in payment card services. In June 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) disclosed that Abra Crypto Card on the American Express network will transact in U.S. dollars and offer crypto back on any purchase category. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best crypto stocks to buy according to smart investors. Based on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)’s performance to date, the management continues to expect full-year revenue growth of 23% to 25% versus a 25.24% consensus and now stands by its initial full-year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65, compared to a $9.84 consensus.On November 29, Redburn analyst Fahed Kunwar initiated coverage of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) with a Neutral rating. The brand power of debit is declining as digital wallets become popular, contended the analyst, who believes the market underestimates the cyclical and structural concerns pressuring card network stocks.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 68 hedge funds were bullish on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 67 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 151.6 million shares worth $20.45 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.”8. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), a California-based computer technology and semiconductor company, is one of the best crypto stocks to monitor. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced in April 2022 its new Intel Blockscale ASIC, offering energy efficient hashing for proof-of-work consensus networks. Intel Blockscale ASIC will provide the energy efficiency and computing power needed to deliver scalable and sustainable operations. On November 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh resumed coverage of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) with a Neutral rating and a $32 price target. Since his earlier research note on February 18, the analyst thinks Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has seen higher challenges in both the server and PC markets, with server CPU ramps delayed to 2023 and weaker PC demand. While Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is regaining some share in PCs, in the core high margin server/data center segment it continues to expect market share loss into 2023, the analyst told investors.According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 69 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 funds in the last quarter worth $2.5 billion. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 15.15 million shares valued at $390.5 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”7. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a multinational financial technology company that serves the financial services, mobile payments, and point of sale industries. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s Cash App makes it convenient to invest in stocks and Bitcoin. In Q3 2022, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s gross profit outperformed Street estimates on the strength of its Cash App and Seller systems, but was partly offset by weaker Buy Now Pay Later gross profit. On November 16, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev raised the price target on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) to $69 from $57 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst said payday lending is largely significant to Cash App gross profit growth. Payday lending is a short-term boost to inflows, but it may eventually pressure Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s multiple as delinquencies across consumer lending continue to increase, the analyst wrote in a research note. This is concerning given Cash App's skew towards lower-income households, added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) at the end of September, compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), with a position worth $505.45 million. It is one of the best crypto stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund include Wells Fargo.”6. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126PayPal Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the favorite crypto stocks among smart investors. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in e-commerce driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:Top Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Best Cloud Computing Stocks To Invest In10 Best Stocks in Each Sector Disclosure: None. 10 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

During the past four quarters, it processed 8.2 trillion transactions. That number is expected to grow in the coming years as the world moves towards a cashless society.Mastercard has been at the forefront of this transition, and it's not slowing down just because it's no longer a startup. For example, it's been partnering with Alphabet's (GOOG)(GOOGL) Google to introduce the Google Wallet in different regions.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MA. Click here to check it out. MA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MAPeter Lynch Chart of MAConsidering its current market dominance and the potential for growth in other areas, Mastercard will likely continue to do well in my opinion. Although there are several fintech disruptors aiming to take its place, Mastercard is holding its own and is still minting money. The company has shown resilience and an ability to change, which bodes well for its long-term prospects. While there is always the risk of new entrants into the market, Mastercard has established itself as a leader and is well-positioned to weather any storms that may come its way.Moving to a cashless worldMastercard recently inked an agreement with Sabre Corp. (NASDAQ:SABR) and Conferma Pay which involves Mastercard making a minority investment in Conferma. By partnering with Mastercard, Sabre can improve its virtual card offerings and expand its geographic reach. This also expands the customer base for both companies.Grand View Research estimates that the global virtual card market could be worth over $11 billion in 2021, and it's expected to grow by 20.7% every year until 2030. Travel spending of $260 billion in a year is managed by Sabre, which has customers in 160 countries and has a network of more than 700 companies, worldwide distribution systems and online booking platforms. With this partnership, Mastercard can access all of that, which will generate growth for its Digital First program.Story continuesGoogle alliance and its implicationsMastercard holders of accounts in the CIMB Bank Berhad and Hong Leong Bank Berhad in Malaysia will now be able to utilize Googe Wallet due to an agreement signed between it and Google in early November. Mastercard's decision needs to be seen in the context of its overall goal to become a leader in digital payments. The e-Conomy SEA 2022 report shows that the gross value of these transactions is projected to rise to $200 billion by 2025.Many people in the region are buying goods and paying for services online due to increased smartphone access. This move will allow Mastercard to tap into this growing market and provide its customers with more convenient and secure payment options. In addition, this partnership will help to further establish Mastercard as a leading player in the global payments industry. This is a great step forward for Mastercard, which has also introduced Google Wallet in South Africa.Mastercard's financial results continue to impressIn the third quarter, Mastercard's net revenue jumped 15% from the year-ago period to $5.8 billion due to resilient consumer spending. This demonstrates both the increase in cashless transactions and the business model's built-in inflation protection. Cross-border volume increased by 41% to $1.8 billion, and the cross-border volume fee went up by 57% as international travel has started to return to normal levels. Mastercard had previously been experiencing a decline in revenue due to limited international travel. However, as more people have already caught Covid, the payment-processing corporation expects international travel to return to its pre-pandemic levels slowly.Mastercard's operating expenses rose by 17%, including personnel, acquisition, advertisement and other investments. However, the figure is not discouraging as adjusted earnings per share jumped by 22% year over year to $2.68, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The company's free cash was $3.579 billion, and comparing it to the current debt at only $957 million, we can see the balance sheet is strong. Mastercard paid $120 million in interest expenses in the quarter, which is not a big deal considering the company's bottom line.Mastercard paid $474 million in dividends in the third quarter and has a forward dividend yield of 0.57%. While not much, it's better than nothing. Furthermore, in the third quarter, the company repurchased $1.6 billion worth of shares and made an additional repurchase of $505 million worth of shares throughout October. The three-year average share buyback ratio is 1.7%.TakeawayMastercard is a company that always done well even in recessions due to how lucrative its business model is. The company may be old, but it is aggressively expanding geographically and adding new services to try and stay ahead of its competitors. The stock has been a long-term money minter for investors, and I don't think that's likely to change any time soon.The global payments industry is vast and continually growing as the world economy expands and developing countries begin to go cashless. Mastercard is positioned to benefit greatly as people become more comfortable with using digital payment methods.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Recognition must be given to the that QUALCOMM has grown EPS by 48% per year, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. QUALCOMM shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 29% to 36%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of QUALCOMM's forecast profits?Are QUALCOMM Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of QUALCOMM, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$164m. We note that this amounts to 0.1% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of QUALCOMM but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesDoes QUALCOMM Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?QUALCOMM's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching QUALCOMM very closely. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for QUALCOMM (2 don't sit too well with us)  you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Shares have added about 22.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Qualcomm due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Qualcomm Tops Q4 Earnings Estimates on Record RevenuesQualcomm reported solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results driven by record revenues and continued focus on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. Both the bottom line and the top line increased year over year and surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate on the strength of the business model, revenue diversification and the ability to respond proactively to the evolving market scenario. However, shares declined sharply post earnings release owing to a soft outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty and high channel inventory levels.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter improved to $2,873 million or $2.54 per share from $2,798 million or $2.45 per share in the prior-year quarter. The increase in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line growth.Quarterly non-GAAP net income came in at $3,548 million or $3.13 per share compared with $2,916 million or $2.55 per share in the year-ago quarter. The non-GAAP earnings per share were largely driven by higher revenues across the board. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.In fiscal 2022, GAAP net income improved to $12,936 million or $11.37 per share from $9,043 million or $7.87 per share in fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP net income came in at $14,254 million or $12.53 per share compared with $9,811 million or $8.54 per share in fiscal 2021.Story continuesRevenuesOn a GAAP basis, total revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter were $11,396 million compared with $9,336 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in revenues was driven by 5G ramp-up, chip design win momentum and solid automotive revenues with diligent execution of operational plans and resilient business culture acting as catalysts. In addition, Qualcomm witnessed strong momentum in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial sectors, along with strength in Snapdragon portfolio within the automotive sector.Non-GAAP revenues in the reported quarter were $11,387 million compared with $9,321 million in the year-earlier quarter. The figure beat the consensus mark of $11,382 million, driven by 5G strength, high-performing core chipsets and new RF front-end content.In fiscal 2022, GAAP revenues improved to $44,200 million from $33,566 million in fiscal 2021, while non-GAAP revenues were up to $44,169 million from $33,467 million.Segment ResultsQuarterly revenues from Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) improved 28% year over year to $9,904 million, driven by strength in handsets and higher demand in adjacent platforms beyond mobile (automotive and IoT). The company is witnessing healthy traction in EDGE networking that helps transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets.RF front-end revenues of $992 million decreased 20% year over year owing to weakness in the handset market and high channel inventory. Handset revenues were up 40% to $6,570 million with continued traction from leading smartphone OEMs such as Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Honor, and increased adoption of Snapdragon mobile technology platform for premium and high-tier Android. Automotive and IoT revenues rose 58% and 24%, respectively, to $427 million and $1,915 million. EBT margin increased to 34% from 32%.Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenues totaled $1,441 million, down 8% year over year due to lower licensing revenues. EBT margin declined to 69% from 72%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityQualcomm generated $1,446 million of net cash from operating activities in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with $1,077 million a year ago, bringing the respective tallies for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 to $9,096 million and $10,536 million. At the fiscal-end, the company had $2,773 million in cash and cash equivalents and $13,537 million of long-term debt compared with the respective tallies of $7,116 million and $13,701 million in the prior-year period. The company repurchased 3 million shares for $500 million during the quarter.Q1 GuidanceFor the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Qualcomm expects GAAP revenues of $9.2-$10 billion due to rapid deterioration in demand and high channel inventory amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and uncertainty. Non-GAAP earnings are projected to be $2.25-$2.45 per share, while GAAP earnings are likely to be $1.72-$1.92 per share. Revenues from QTL are expected to be between $1.45 billion and $1.65 billion. For QCT, the company anticipates revenues between $7.7 billion and $8.3 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -35.45% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Qualcomm has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerQualcomm is part of the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry. Over the past month, Ericsson (ERIC), a stock from the same industry, has gained 21.6%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Ericsson reported revenues of $6.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.7%. EPS of $0.16 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.For the current quarter, Ericsson is expected to post earnings of $0.18 per share, indicating a change of -50% from the year-ago quarter.

Through the app, pregnant women can access educational materials, fill out follow-up forms, receive relevant alerts and messages and record the progress of their pregnancy.""The SUS (Sistema Unico de Saúde) is the largest public health system in the world with approximately 70% of the Brazilian population depending on it. Our goal with the SIM program is to demonstrate how mobile technology can support a system as large and complex as the SUS to become more efficient. To do so, we are looking for a topic as relevant as pregnant women and in particular at-risk pregnant women"", adds Gustavo Perez, CEO of MTM Tecnologia.Data collected by the app will be analyzed and shared with the healthcare providers through the project's web-based platform. Having access to this information will allow the SIM Maternity project and healthcare teams to monitor the health of the pregnant women, as well as extract reports and health indicators. Through the app, key actions can be taken by the SIM Maternity health team such as: register observations, notify the medical team, review the patient's medical history and access data and information submitted by the patient. In addition, the health team is notified whenever there is a potential health alert.Story continues""Currently, most prenatal consultations are carried out by the family health team in primary health care units.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Lockheed MartinThe Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$496). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 100% of Frank St. John's holding.In total, Lockheed Martin insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Lockheed Martin Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that Lockheed Martin insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. Specifically, insider John Donovan bought US$251k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that Lockheed Martin insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$87m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. While recent transactions indicate confidence in Lockheed Martin, insiders don't own enough of the company to overcome our cautiousness about the longer term transactions. In short they are likely aligned with shareholders. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Lockheed Martin. While conducting our analysis, we found that Lockheed Martin has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to see more good stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.A good stock to buy is a stock of a strong company that can grow earnings in the future.Although a good stock to buy might decline in the near term, there would be a good chance that the good stock to buy would be higher in the long term given the company's normalized earnings potential and its competitive advantages. Ideally a good stock to buy would trade for a fair or attractive valuation.Many good stocks to buy have historically been leading blue chips that have increased their earnings per share over time. Many of the same stocks make it to the Dividend Aristocrats list where the company has increased its annual dividend for 25 years or more. Many good stocks to buy also return capital back to shareholders through share repurchases. Good stocks to buy are generally less volatile than the general market although there can be exceptions.Given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates significantly this year, the broader market has declined substantially with the S&amp;P 500 down 15% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6% year to date. Many stocks, including good stocks to buy, have also declined substantially as well. As a result, some blue chips with competitive advantages trade for fairly attractive valuations if the economy can grow as expected.Recently, stocks have increased due to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments that the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates at a slower pace.Nevertheless, Powell also said the central bank will still raise rates until it defeats inflation. He added, ""Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.""If economic data fails to meet expectations, the good stocks to buy could decline even further. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesTrump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now, we picked 15 companies with the right mix of scale, competitive advantages, and earnings growth potential.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stocks at the end of Q3 2022.15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now15.

(NYSE:WMT) shares also have a dividend yield of around 1.46%.9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Given the inflation headwind, shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) stock have fallen 8.4% year to date. Nevertheless, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has many leading consumer product brands that could rebound if the Federal Reserve wins its battle against inflation.

Although the company's earnings might not meet expectations next year if there is a recession, analysts believe JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) will grow its EPS in the long term given its growing market share and its earnings power.Vltava Fund commented on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.Click to continue reading and see 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.Suggested articles:Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksObama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year ReturnsAQR Capital’s Performance, AUM and Top Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The amount will be paid out on Jan 3, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Dec 14, 2022. Based on the stock’s closing price of $45.15 per share on Dec 1, 2022, it has a dividend yield of 1.33%.This move highlights the company’s sound and stable financial position and its commitment to reward shareholders regularly. Addressing this shareholder-friendly move, PulteGroup’s president and CEO, Ryan Marshall, stated, “This action demonstrates our ongoing commitment to returning funds to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past six months, shares of the company have gained 11.7% compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 15.8% rise.Since 2018, PulteGroup's board of directors adopted a regular quarterly cash dividend policy. It paid out cash dividends of $148.1 million, $135.1 million, $124.4 million and $108.5 million in 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The trend continued in 2022 as well. In the first nine months of 2022, it provided cash dividends of $106.7 million. A solid capital allocation strategy — which is a testimony to the company’s stability amid the prevailing macro-economic woes — drives long-term sustainable growth and shareholders’ value.PulteGroup is also highly active on the buyback front. In the first nine months of 2022, the company repurchased 21.8 million shares under the repurchase authorization for $974.7 million. At Sep 30, 2022, it had remaining authorization of $482.9 million shares.Can PulteGroup Sustain Dividend Hikes?The housing market is significantly affected by supply chain disruptions, intense inflationary pressure, affordability issues and a smaller bond-buying program. The federal government’s actions related to economic stimulus, taxation and borrowing limits could affect consumer confidence and spending levels.The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) recent rate hike brings the central bank’s benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, to a new range of 3.0% to 3.25% — its highest level since 2008 — from a range between 2.25% and 2.5%. Officials expect the Fed funds rate to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2022 and 4.6% by the end of 2023.This apart, PHM’s net new orders in the third-quarter 2022 declined 28% from a year ago. The decrease in orders reflects softer demand, resulting mainly from higher interest rates as the absorption pace fell to 2.0 homes per month, down from three homes per month for the same period last year. Also, it was impacted by a significant increase in cancelations. The cancelation rate for the third quarter was 24%, higher than the 10% in the year-ago period and 15% in the second quarter of 2022.Despite these headwinds, PulteGroup has been banking on an accretive land acquisition strategy and focusing on growing demand for entry-level homes.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPHM currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are CRH plc CRH, Janus International Group, Inc.

JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.Click to continue reading and see 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.Suggested articles:Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksObama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year ReturnsAQR Capital’s Performance, AUM and Top Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks.Raymond Thomas Dalio is an American billionaire investor and hedge fund manager, who has served as co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates since 1985. A global macro investor for more than 50 years, Dalio ran his hedge fund for most of its 47 years, building it into the largest hedge fund in the world and the fifth most important private company in the US according to Fortune Magazine. Recently, however, Dalio stepped down from running Bridgewater Associates and announced to remain on the fund’s board and public research team.Responsible for a number of investment innovations, including risk parity and alpha overlay, Dalio believes in taking profits on expensive stocks and then reinvesting. He calls this practice ""rotating the portfolio.""  As of this November, the billionaire’s real-time net worth amounts to $19.1 billion, according to Forbes. Over the decades he has become a valued macroeconomic advisor to many policymakers around the world and was even named one of the “100 Most Influential People in the World” by TIME magazine.One can also measure Dalio's investment expertise by the fact that the flagship Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater Associates returned 32% during the first half of the year due to increased economic volatility, while the broader markets have been left struggling in the wake of global macroeconomic concerns. Some of the premier holdings of the Bridgewater portfolio include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock PicksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur Methodology We scanned Bridgewater's Q3 portfolio and picked top 10 stocks that the fund has been holding over the past several quarters.Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $293.7 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.48%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns CVS Pharmacy, a retail pharmacy chain; CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager; and Aetna, a health insurance provider, among many other brands. The company has been a part of Bridgewater Associates’ portfolio since the third quarter of 2012 when the hedge fund opened its position with shares worth $2.7 million. It represents 1.48% of billionaire Ray Dalio’s Q3 portfolio.Story continuesOn November 21, Credit Suisse analyst A.J. Rice raised the price target on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) to $125 from $117 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares post the company's Healthcare Conference and Q3 inputs.Of the 920 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 67 hedge funds owned stakes in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.14 billion.In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is one of the stocks backed by billionaire Ray Dalio in Q3 2022.Vltava Fund commented on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in a Q3 2022 investor letter, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”9. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $298 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company that operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The company has been a part of Ray Dalio's portfolio since the third quarter of 2020. As of the third quarter of 2022, Bridgewater Associates increased its position in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) by 11%. Ray Dalio's hedge fund owns over 3 million shares in the company, with a total value of over $298 million.Barclays analyst Matt Miksic lowered the price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $114 from $118 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the market reaction to the company's Q3 results returned Abbott shares to early October levels. However, he finds Abbott's performance in Diabetes, EPD and Cardio Devices to be ""encouraging.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”8. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $317.06 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.6%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is a Shanghai, China-based social e-commerce platform with a user base of 900 million globally. The company leverages technology to promote and enable the traditional agriculture industry. As of 2022, 16 million farmers have connected with the platform in China.  At the close of Q3 2022, he reported holding $317.06 million worth of PDD shares. The billionaire added the company to his portfolio back in Q2 2019.Morgan Stanley analyst Eddy Wang raised the price target on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) to $77 from $65 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares after the company's Q3 results beat his estimates on both the top and bottom lines on November 29. Wang expects Pinduoduo's revenue growth momentum to carry well into Q4 based off an easier base, citing greater promotional activity during this year's Double 11.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 54 hedge funds were long Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), compared to 41 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.20 million shares valued at $326 million.Here’s what Tao Value said about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue grow with such a team with strong culture.”7. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $487.73 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 2.46%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald.

According to the analyst, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is placed in an enviable position, where its U.S. business is less reliant on unit growth or remodeling in the face of rising interest rates, and should continue to benefit from a largely rational promotional environment in the wake of the European and FX headwinds.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was a part of 53 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 50 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey’s data. The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth over $1.8 billion collectively.6. Walmart Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

137,3a7e4cdb-93f2-3595-bb2f-da3c4794e749,RSG,2022-12-03,Republic Services: Strong Results Don't Come Cheap,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republic-services-strong-results-dont-203315500.html,1670013195.0,STORY,['RSG'],"[Republic Services Inc. (NYSE:RSG) has gained a little more than 3% year to date, which is well ahead of the double-digit decline in the S&amp;P 500 Index.Republic Services: Strong Results Don't Come CheapThere is likely a simple explanation for this as Republic Services provides solid waste disposal and recycling services that customers need regardless of the state of the economy. As such, the companys business is very resilient and has grown under almost every type of conditions.RSG 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of RSGPeter Lynch Chart of RSGTakeaways from recent earnings resultsRepublic Services has seen steady growth over much of the last decade.Republic Services: Strong Results Don't Come CheapThe company has proven to be very successful at outperforming the markets expectations. For example, Republic Services announced third-quarter earnings results on Oct. 27. Revenue grew 23% to $3.6 billion and topped analysts estimates by $67 million. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.34, a sizeable improvement from the prior years result of $1.11 and 12 cents ahead of expectations.Republic Services has beaten revenue estimates in nine out of the past 11 quarters and has not missed earnings estimates since the second quarter of 2018.Trash and recycling services are basic and essential to everyday life for residential and commercial customers. This provides Republic Services with a wide moat business. Even in the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, when many businesses were forced to close, trash still needed to be collected. This demand shows up in the companys results. Revenue fell just 6% and 3% in the second and third quarters, respectively, of 2020. Compare these declines to almost any other industry and they are likely to look much more attractive.Just as important, Republic Services rebounded very quickly and, by the next year, revenue would set new company records.The same can be said about the Great Recession. Earnings per share fell just 7.3% from 2007 to 2009 before making a new high by 2011.These results show the stickiness of the companys business even in difficult environments, as well as its ability to grow under improving conditions.Story continuesAccording to Value Line, revenue and earnings per share have a compound annual growth rate of 3.7% and 9.8% over the last decade. The difference in the growth rates has been a reduction in the share count and a 360-basis points expansion in the net profit margin to 11.8%.The most recent quarter showed exceptional growth, the best in the companys recent history in the case of revenue. A little more than 12% of this revenue growth comes from Republic Services purchase of U.S. Ecology. The deal, which had a total value of $2.2 billion including debt, closed on May 2. The addition of U.S. Ecology will only enhance Republic Services leadership position in the solid waste disposal and recycling market, which is estimated at $91 billion.The third quarter was the first where U.S. Ecology was included for the entirety of the period and the additional month of inclusion saw revenue grow nearly 6% sequentially. The company should be accretive to earnings as soon as this year.Republic Services is not just benefiting from a timely acquisition. Organic revenue was higher by 10.2%, while revenue growth from average yield was 5.6% and volume was up 2.2%. Core pricing increased almost 7%. Not only are the companys services seeing strength in its business, customers are willing to pay more for them.In addition, a tight labor market is acting as a tailwind to Republic Services as competitors are not able to make the companys services due to a lack of workers. This is reflected in open market pricing, which tracks worker expenses and was up 8.7%. Restricted pricing, which use CPI adjustments in contracts, was only up 4%.There are some negatives with regards to Republic Services as an investment. First, the companys long-term debt has greatly increased over the last decade.Republic Services: Strong Results Don't Come CheapIn total, long-term debt has increased more than 62% over the last 10 years. Approximately a quarter of this debt matures within the next five years.The good news is this debt has been used to fuel growth to such levels that adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow have 11% and 10% compound annual growth rates over the last three years. These rates should accelerate with U.S. Ecology now a part of the company. For example, third-quarter free cash flow improved 23% year over year to almost $1.7 billion. Equipped with this type of cash flow, debt levels should be more manageable, though this is an area shareholders will want to monitor.The second issue is the price of recycling prices. The average recycled commodity price per ton sold during the quarter was $162, which was $56 lower sequentially and down $68 year over year. Pricing is expected to be in the low-$90 range for the fourth quarter. Inflationary pressures are one reason that pricing has fallen as higher energy costs have led to weaker demand for recycled material.Another reason for the decline in pricing includes the strong U.S. dollar. A strengthening dollar caused exports to international markets, such as India and Southeast Asia, to become significantly more expensive. Demand in these regions is key as the U.S. does not trade much material with Europe. Without demand from these markets, pricing will face further pressure.If expected fourth-quarter pricing were to remain constant for 2023, then adjusted earnings per share could be reduced by as much as 15 to 18 cents, not an immaterial amount.Even here there is sliver of good news as the dollar has begun to weaken slightly, but a further weakening would be needed to help increase demand.Despite this, Republic Services expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4.77 to $4.80 for 2022, which would be a 15% increase at the midpoint.The company has an excellent GF Score of 91 out of 100, implying outperformance in the stock could be had going forward. This score is driven by perfect or near-perfect scores for growth, profitability and momentum, offset by weaker showings on financial strength and value.Republic Services: Strong Results Don't Come CheapValuation analysisBased on managements guidance for the year, Republic Services is trading at 29 times forward estimates. This is a premium multiple, but investors have shown a willingness to pay up for stable growth and solid performance under adverse conditions. Shares have a price-earnings ratio of more than 25 over the last five years, so the stock is overvalued in comparison to its medium-term average.The GF Value chart shows the stock to be trading right at fair value.Republic Services: Strong Results Don't Come CheapRepublic Services has a price-to-GF Value ratio of exactly 1.Final thoughtsRepublic Services has used its positioning as a leader in its industry to produce solid results over the long term. A recent acquisition has caused growth rates to spike, but the company is also seeing high rates of organic growth. Income investors will note the company has raised its dividend for 18 consecutive years.Shares are not cheap as investors have pushed the multiple to the high 20 range. Using intrinsic value, shares are much more fairly valued.Value investors might be turned off by the multiple, but others might find Republic Services' ability to navigate difficult periods of time, as well as the its sticky business model, as attractive.And while trash and recycling services may not be the most exciting industry, Republic Services ability to outperform the broader market should stand out.Even with these tailwinds, Republic Services has a fairly valued rating from GuruFocus, which some investors might find appealing given the steadiness of the business.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

CNM are some stocks likely to gain from the abovementioned factors.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry comprises companies engaged in the collection, transportation, treatment, disposal, inspection and regulation of any form of waste. The companies serve residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in the United States and internationally. Some industry participants provide non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling, disposal, and energy services for small-container, large-container, municipal and residential, and energy services customers in the United States and Puerto Rico, while others provide waste management environmental services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers in North America. Some industry players operate as environmental infrastructure and solutions companies, providing water handling and recycling solutions.What's Shaping the Future of Waste Removal Services Industry?A Healthy Demand Environment:The industry is mature, with growth coming from volume and price increases. Income has grown steadily over the past few years, enabling most industry players to pursue acquisitions and other investments.The Uptick in Economic Activities Bodes Well:With the reopening of the economy and the resumption of business activities, waste generation is bound to increase, especially in industrial and commercial sectors. Despite the decline in COVID-19 cases, proper disposal of medical waste will always remain an utmost priority to curb the spread of infection. Increases in population, industrialization and urbanization should remain the key drivers of the industry as these lead to a significant rise in garbage and recycling. Also, the use of advanced collection and recycling solutions is expected to pick up pace. This should enhance business opportunities for waste management companies.Story continuesGovernment initiatives as well as stringent rules and regulations to advance sustainable waste management mechanisms and put a check on illegal dumping are also expected to boost the industry.High Operating Costs a Woe: Given that waste management is both a time-consuming and complex process, it requires higher capital and operating costs to manage waste collection vehicles, bins, and processing equipment along with a huge number of workers. Such high operational expenses are likely to keep the bottom line of the companies in this industrial cohort under pressure.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #138.

Other than energy, the market landscape has been dim. During times of heightened volatility, adding low-beta stocks can help blend in an extra layer of portfolio defense.Stocks with a beta of less than 1.0 are less volatile than the general market, and the opposite is also true – stocks with a beta of higher than 1.0 are more volatile than the general market.Three low-beta stocks – Merck &amp; Co, Inc. MRK, The J M Smucker Company SJM, and General Mills, Inc. GIS – could all be considered during a volatile market.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.Merck &amp; Co, Inc.

Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.U.S. stock markets are witnessing a solid rally since mid-October, which is likely to extend till the year-end. We have selected four Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to gain from the ongoing rally. These stocks are — Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH and Walmart Inc. WMT.Dow Suffers the LeastYear to date, the three large-cap-centric stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 5.4%, 14.5% and 26.6% respectively. On Dec 1, the Dow — popularly known as the blue-chip index of Wall Street — technically exited the bear territory after closing more than 20% higher over its recent low posted on Sep 30.The primary concern of the U.S. economy is soaring inflation which is currently at its 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has already hiked interest rate sharply by 3.75% year to date.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks, especially the technology  players. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks rather than growth stocks. Therefore, the index has suffered the least.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks. These stocks have solid potential for December and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our four picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerck has been benefiting from strong sales of  Keytruda, Lynparza and Bridion. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Story continuesAnimal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck’s new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio will be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days.Caterpillar’s revenues and earnings grew year over year for six straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of the ongoing supply-chain snarls and cost pressures.We expect CAT’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow 11.6%, while revenues are predicted to rise 11.2%. The Construction Industries space is expected to benefit from rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. CAT’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.Caterpillar has an expected earnings growth rate of 27.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 2% over the last 30 days.Walmart has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. WMT has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships. WMT’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in the grocery segment.Walmart has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.6% for next year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.9% over the last 30 days.UnitedHealth has been benefiting from a strong market position and an attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.UNH’s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. UnitedHealth’s government business remains well-poised for growth. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments and prudent capital deployment through share buybacks and dividends.

Let me pull up our industrials map. There we go. And here's Boeing, up 24% for the month. And I'm going to dial this down to a two-year chart. The plane giant is nearing a deal with United Airlines to buy dozens of 787 Dreamliners. No parties are commenting on the record.But Boeing competitor Airbus reportedly in the running for some of the orders. The Dreamliner sports a $300 million price tag. It's noted for its fuel efficiency and ability to make long haul routes in a single stop without the need to refuel. And the deal, if it goes through, would be a major win for Boeing, which has been beset by setbacks since those two 737 MAX planes crashed in 2018 and 2019.This is a two-year chart. Just want to show you, this chart right here is showing a breakout, very nascent breakout on a longer term basis. It could mean something. When you take a look at the other industrial companies here over the last month, Boeing is actually one of the big leaders. I got some materials companies thrown in there, too, but if readers will remember-- viewers will remember all the way back to 2017, this was the stock market in 2017. Of course, that was in the past-- not so much anymore.DAVE BRIGGS: Very interesting to watch them against their competition. Boeing had dominated that category that the Dreamliner plays in, so it's a big win against them, but they've taken very different paths to the same place, which is both down 12% year to date in a year where travel truly has bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. All right.]"

153,15cc7a70-32f2-3bec-a755-28391ddf9e29,SO,2022-12-03,7 Must Own Stocks to Survive the Fed’s Aggressive Rate Hikes,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-must-own-stocks-survive-161946823.html,1669738786,STORY,"['SCHW', 'WMT', 'UNH', 'SO', 'BJ', 'DG']","[The Fed will continue its aggressive rate hikes into 2023, albeit at a slightly slower pace. Following a fourth-consecutive 75 basis point (0.75%) rate hike on Nov. 2, it now looks like the pace will slacken. Current expectations are that the central bank will increase rates 50 basis points when the Federal Open Market Committee adjourns in December. Thus, this is shaping up to be an interesting time for those looking for must own stocks in this environment.Still, a lot remains to be seen before the Fed convenes on December 14-15. In particular, November inflation numbers will be released just prior to the meeting. Any negative surprise could quickly change the decision calculus of the Fed, and could potentially lead to another 75 basis point hike. In short, investors should continue to expect an aggressive Fed and plan accordingly. Survival in this environment requires adherence to tried-and-tested strategies. Banks benefit from higher rates, and defensive stocks protect against the downside. Those must own stocks provide a great place to hide in this environment. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTDToronto-Dominion Bank$66.28DGDollar General$252.93SCHWCharles Schwab$80.66UNHUnitedHealth$528.27WMTWalmart$153.18SOSouthern Company$65.43BJBJ’s Wholesale$75.36Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)Toronto-Dominion (TD) Bank logo on buildingSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comToronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) is a stock set to survive aggressive rate hikes for the simple reason that bank profit margins rise as interest rates increase. So, given the expected hikes ahead, Toronto-Dominion Bank should reliably price in this “good news” moving forward. As rates increase, banks increase the interest they charge on loans, thereby increasing income. That has indeed been the case for TD Bank. Revenues were nearly stagnant, increasing slightly from C$10.712 billion in Q3 ‘21 to $CAD10.925 billion in Q3 ‘22. However, net interest income has risen during the same period, which can be directly attributed to rising rates. During the same period, interest income increased from $CAD 6.004 billion to $CAD 7.044 billion.Story continuesTD stock reliably benefits from predictably rising interest income. This results in higher overall revenue in times like these, when rates are on the rise. Therefore, TD stock should remain a strong performer into 2023 and beyond.   Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDollar General (NYSE:DG) stock has had an exceptionally strong 2022. This discount retailer has appreciated in price by roughly 9% through Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 16% this year. The reason Dollar General is likely to continue to thrive is that 2023 rate hikes threaten to tip the balance of the economy. What I mean is that the economy is precariously near the edge. The Fed’s previous moves have yet to produce their intended effects. Thus, rate hikes tend to produce lagging results, meaning a 2023 recession is far from out of the question. Investors don’t need to dig deep into Dollar General’s fundamentals in order to understand why it’s a strong choice. Although the company’s fundamentals remain strong, it’s the macroeconomic situation that makes DG shares equally attractive. In short, consumers are increasingly drawn to the retailer’s offerings because discounts matter.  Sales increased 9% in the previous quarter and aren’t likely to slow down as influential voices continue to predict an oncoming recession. Charles Schwab (SCHW)Piggy bank on a wooden table with stacks of coins next to it.Source: FabrikaSimf / ShutterstockCharles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) stock benefits from many of the same tailwinds that Toronto-Dominion Bank does. Namely, higher rates are proving to be a big benefit to earnings. In fact, Charles Schwab’s recently posted Q3 earnings set a new record for the company. The $5.5 billion in revenues set a record, leading to adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.10, also a record. Wall Street had been expecting $5.4 billion in revenues and $1.05 in earnings. Additionally, like TD Bank, Charles Schwab is experiencing rapidly-increasing net interest revenues. In Q3, those net interest revenues increased by 44% to a whopping $2.9 billion. Another way Charles Schwab can help investors survive rate hikes is through the income it provides from its dividend. That dividend is yielding 1.07% on a forward basis and hasn’t been reduced since 1989. Investors can reinvest this dividend or use it for income. Either way, Schwab’s dividend provides a 1% return that can be especially helpful in tough times. UnitedHealth (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) is a leading healthcare stock, and as most investors know, healthcare stocks are commonly viewed as defensive picks. While financial stocks are attractive in a rising rate environment, economic weakness can blunt any net interest gains. However, healthcare stocks thrive for a different reason. Namely, these stocks’ defensive nature. Healthcare stocks fare well because people require healthcare in every part of the economic cycle. Thus, UNH stock acts as something of a hedge against the worst effects of a downturn. The good news for investors is that UnitedHealth stock still has plenty of room to rise. While many defensive stocks are fully priced, UNH shares have nearly 12% upside based on consensus target stock prices. UnitedHealth has also beaten analyst earnings per share expectations in each of the past four quarters and yet still has $70 of upside. Its defensive nature makes it a reasonable stock in which to park capital in these tough times. Furthermore, its dividend provides additional return beyond any share price appreciation. Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has recently seen a nice rebound, which is one of the key reasons this is on my list of must own stocks to buy. For one, discount retail stocks tend to fare well as economic worries mount. Walmart is the country’s largest retailer by revenue and its discounted prices and strong purchasing power bode well for the company moving forward. During the most recent quarter, Walmart’s comparable sales increased 8.2%. This fact is notable, considering the company is also the largest food retailer in the U.S. With food prices remaining stubbornly high, Walmart should continue to see grocery shopping foot traffic remain strong. In Q3, shopper visits to Walmart increased by 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. Holiday retail sales are expected to grow by 6% to 8% this year, reaching $960.4 billion at the 8% level. Walmart will begin to benefit substantially beginning on Black Friday. The results of those sales won’t be known immediately, but investors should buy WMT stock, as this defensive play should remain strong in most economic scenarios moving into 2023. Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comSouthern Company (NYSE:SO) is an electric utility company serving Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi. Like healthcare, people need electricity no matter how bad the economy gets. Thus, Southern Company is a safe bet to continue to perform well for that reason. The company also provides gas and fiber optic services to its customer base in addition to electricity. Again, consumer demand for those services tends to remain relatively steady, or inelastic, despite prevailing economic conditions. SO stock is currently priced around $66. That is quite close to its average consensus target price of $68. That would seem to suggest that inventors hold off until there’s a lull in this company’s valuation. However, SO shares have traded above $80 recently and current prices likely represent that lull.   Further, Southern Company pays a very healthy dividend with a forward yield of 4.1%. It hasn’t been reduced since 1986, and patterns suggest that it will probably be increased by 2 cents, to 70 cents, sometime next year. BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ)BJ Wholesale (BJ) storefront with red BJ logo on frontSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comBJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) recently reported record earnings for its third quarter. The good news for investors is that despite the strong results, 12.3% upside remains based on consensus target prices. Big box wholesalers including Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and BJ’s have had a strong 2022 as inflation has been particularly hard on grocery prices. As a result, consumers continue to buy in bulk in record numbers. Surprisingly, BJ stock remains far from target prices, which makes its appeal even greater. The company’s Q3 earnings released Nov. 17 were very strong, with comparable sales jumping 9.7% year-over-year. Rising gas prices contributed to those strong numbers. However, even with the effects of gasoline stripped out, comparable sales increased by 5.3%. And while comparable sales, which measure stores that have been open for 12 months or more, increased by 9.7%, overall sales grew by 12.3% in the quarter. This number was even higher through the first three quarters, at an even more impressive 17%. Through the same period, net income has grown by an outsized 20.2%. Accordingly, BJ stock looks to have been ignored this year, which makes it a great buying opportunity. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares have added about 12.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TE Connectivity due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.TE Connectivity's Q4 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat EstimatesTE Connectivity reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.88 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.5%. The figure rose 11.2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading and 1.1%, sequentially.Net sales in the reported quarter were $4.4 billion, which beat the consensus mark by 3.3%. The figure rose 14% on a reported basis and 21%, organically, from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s readings. TEL also increased 6.4%, sequentially.Top-line growth was driven by the well-performing transportation, communications and industrial solutions of TEL.TE Connectivity generated orders of $4.3 billion in the reported quarter, reflecting continued strong customer demand.Top-Line DetailsTransportation Solutions: The segment generated $2.45 billion, accounting for 56% of net sales. The figure grew 11% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. TEL witnessed 14% growth in automotive sales, driven by the growing proliferation of electric vehicles. Commercial transportation sales also grew 14% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally, driven by a strong performance in North America and Europe. However, sensor sales fell 2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level due to portfolio optimization activities.Industrial Solutions: The segment generated $1.25 billion, accounting for 29% of net sales. The figure rose 23% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number. This was driven by robust industrial equipment sales, which grew 35% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure owing to continued benefits from factory automation applications. Aerospace, defense and marine sales improved 21% on market improvement in commercial aerospace. Solid momentum across renewable applications remained positive for TEL’s energy business, which rose 16% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Medical sales’ growth of 8% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level was attributed to higher interventional procedures.Story continuesCommunications Solutions: The segment generated $660 million, accounting for 15% of net sales. The figure was up 10% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. This was driven by solid content growth in high-speed cloud applications, leading to a 19% rise from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading in data and devices sales. However, appliance sales fell 5% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading, reflecting moderation in the end market.Operating DetailsPer management, the gross profit was $1.35 billion, up 6.8% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s level. As a percentage of revenues, the figure contracted 200 basis points (bps) from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to 31%.We note that selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses of $412 million and $179 million rose 7.3% and 3.5% from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals, respectively.TE Connectivity’s adjusted operating margin was 17.4% in the reported quarter, which contracted 110 bps from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $1.09 billion, up from $820 million as of Jun 24, 2022.Long-term debt was $3.29 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, down from $3.38 billion in the prior fiscal quarter.TE Connectivity generated $944 million of cash from operations in the reported quarter compared with $579 million in the sequential fiscal quarter. Further, it generated a free cash flow of $745 million.TEL returned $515 million to its shareholders.GuidanceFor first-quarter fiscal 2023, TE Connectivity expects net sales of $3.75 billion with 2% growth on a reported basis from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading and 9% on an organic basis.Adjusted earnings are projected at $1.50 per share. The consensus mark is pegged at $1.74 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -12.93% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, TE Connectivity has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise TE Connectivity has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Engine-maker Pratt &amp; Whitney, Collins Aerospace, GKN Aerospace, BAE Systems and Spirit Aerosystems are among the more than 400 suppliers in 40 states.Northrop is calling the plane a sixth generation aircraft given its ability to connect to other aircraft and easily integrate future weapons into its systems architecture.The B-21 also features more durable, stealth-enabling low observable surface material that will require less maintenance and keep operations costs and downtime to a minimum, Doug Young, sector vice president and general manager at Northrop Grumman Aeronautics Systems, told Reuters in an interview.The presentation provided the first video and photo images of the new bomber. Previously, only artist renderings have been published.Six of the planes, which is to have its first flight in mid-2023, are in various stages of assembly. More than 8,000 people from Northrop Grumman, industry partners and the Air Force currently work on the program.

The 38-year-old midfielder played for Barcelona for the majority of his professional career.Characterized as a “thinker with a philosopher’s understanding of space and time” by Bleacher Report, Britannica describes him as more of a team player than a goal scorer.Regardless of the disappointing 2022 season of his current club (Japan’s Vissel Kobe’s record is 11-7-16, 40 points), Iniesta has his impressive portfolio to fall back on.He invested in F1rst Vision, an immersive broadcasting camera that is pinned to players’ jerseys, in 2015.Forbes also reported that he inherited a vineyard in 2010, owns his own sportswear line, and has had an endorsement deal with sneaker company Asics since 2018.8.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +22.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has gained 17.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share, indicating a change of -20.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -20.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 indicates a change of +26.1% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nike, the consensus sales estimate of $12.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.8%. The $48.97 billion and $52.84 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.8% and +7.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.91%. The EPS surprise was +2.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the plant in Ireland, expansion is expected to begin in 2024 and to be completed in 2027, the company said.The Puurs site has played a key role in the production of COVID-19 vaccine shots Pfizer developed with its German partner BioNTech using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.Output started there in late 2020 when Europe and the United States began rolling out shots to tackle the pandemic.""It is all aligned with the growth of our pipeline,"" Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott told Reuters.""If you project out the capacity modeling for these two sites ... you'll find a gap in our ability to serve that (growth). So this is proactive investment,"" he said on Thursday.Pfizer's revenue is expected to top $100 billion this year - more than double its pre-pandemic level - on the strength of sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment Paxlovid.But COVID-related sales are expected to drop sharply over the next few years, and Pfizer also faces the loss of patent protections for some big-selling medicines after 2025, such as cancer treatment Ibrance and arthritis drug Xeljanz.Story continuesThe sizeable investment and creation of jobs in Europe comes at a critical time for the region as companies struggle with soaring costs of energy, labour, raw materials and credit, fuelling worries over a recession.The crisis has hit energy-intensive industries, such as fertilisers and chemicals, particularly hard, prompting some to shift manufacturing to locations where cheap energy is abundant, such as the United States.Drug manufacturers have also warned that energy costs risk undermining the recent push to boost generic medicines production in Europe to make the region more self-sufficient.NEW MEDICINESPfizer hopes to introduce as many as 19 new medicines over the next year and a half, including treatments for ulcerative colitis and migraines, as well as its vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).""Our portfolio is strong and requires an expansion of our network to accommodate these new products that will really make an impact,"" McDermott said.The new products produced at the plants will cover various therapeutic areas including rare diseases, inflammation and immunology, he said.The expansion in Ireland will add around 400 to 500 jobs and allow it to double the amount of drug substance it makes at the site, which produces material for complex biologic drugs and vaccines.In Belgium, Pfizer is expanding the Puurs site's capacity to finalize and bottle doses of drug substance. It is also expanding its packaging and cold storage capabilities there.The new projects will result in an additional 250 jobs at the Belgian plant, whose workforce has grown to 4,500 people from 2,800 before the pandemic.Pfizer has also been spending significantly to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States. The New York-based drugmaker has announced plans to expand its Kalamazoo, Michigan, Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and McPherson, Kansas, plants.It has also said it will spend close to $1 billion to boost its ability to produce gene therapies at sites in Massachusetts and North Carolina.($1 = 0.9530 euros) (Reporting by Michael Erman in Maplewood, NJ; Editing by Josephine Mason, Alexander Smith and Mark Potter)]"

(NYSE:PFE) insiders this past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-may-not-want-ignore-140007819.html,1669989607,STORY,['PFE'],"[While Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shareholders have had a good week with the stock up 4.6%, they shouldn't let their guards down. Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$8.2m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PfizerOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Mikael Dohlsten, for US$3.2m worth of shares, at about US$49.36 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$51.08, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 16% of Mikael Dohlsten's holding.Insiders in Pfizer didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Pfizer Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Pfizer insiders own 0.04% of the company, worth about US$108m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Pfizer Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Pfizer insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Pfizer insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Pfizer has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.But note: Pfizer may not be the best stock to buy.

AstraZeneca AZN is set to acquire private biotech, Neogene Therapeutics to get access to the latter’s next-generation T-cell receptor therapies. Eli Lilly’s LLY phase III data showed its Alzheimer’s disease candidate, donanemab leads to a significant reduction of amyloid buildup in the brain compared to Biogen’s BIIB approved Alzheimer’s drug, Aduhelm.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAstraZeneca to Build Cell Therapies Pipeline With New Acquisition: AstraZeneca announced an agreement to acquire private biotech, Neogene Therapeutics that will give it access to the latter’s next-generation T-cell receptor therapies and thereby build its pipeline of cell-based cancer medicines. AstraZeneca will pay $320 million to acquire all outstanding equity of Neogene, which will include an initial payment of $200 million on deal closing. The remaining $120 million is contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory clearances.Lilly’s Alzheimer’s Study on Donanemab Meets Goal :Lilly presented data from a phase III early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease study called TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4 study, which showed that its pipeline candidate donanemab produced a significant reduction of amyloid buildup in the brain and P-tau in the blood after six months compared to Biogen’s Aduhelm. Amyloid plaque and P-tau are key biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and their reduction is likely to predict clinical benefit in the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease.In the study, which assessed donanemab’s superiority over Biogen’s Aduhelm on amyloid plaque reduction, donanemab met all primary and secondary endpoints for the six-month primary outcome analysis. The data were presented at the 15th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference. The data showed that 37.9% of donanemab-treated participants experienced brain amyloid clearance compared with 1.6% of Aduhelm-treated patients at six months.Story continuesDonanemab reduced brain amyloid plaque levels versus baseline by 65.2% compared with 17.0% for Aduhelm at six months, thereby meeting a key secondary outcome. As far as the safety profile of the candidates is concerned, the incidence of total amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), a brain swelling side effect associated with anti-amyloid antibodies, was 26.1% in Aduhelm arm compared with 25.4% in the donanemab arm. Importantly, though treatment with donanemab led to much greater amyloid clearance than Aduhelm, it was not associated with a higher rate of ARIA.Eli Lilly’s biologics license application seeking accelerated approval of donanemab, based on data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, is already under priority review with the FDA. A decision is expected in early 2023.Pfizer &amp; Roivant Sciences Form New Vant Company: Pfizer and Roivant Sciences announced the formation of a new Vant company to advance the development of PF-06480605, a TL1A-directed antibody originally developed by Pfizer for treating inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.  TL1A is a cytokine believed to play a key role in inflammation and fibrosis. PF-06480605, now RVT-3101, is being developed in phase IIb for ulcerative colitis (UC). The data from the study is expected in the first half of 2023. The new Vant or Roivant subsidiary will take care of funding the global development of RVT-3101 in UC and additional inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.

178,9ccabdc2-5d1e-3164-a767-f1b4423345da,PFE,2022-12-03,The business of clinical trials is booming. Private equity has taken notice,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/business-clinical-trials-booming-private-100000163.html,1669975200,STORY,['PFE'],"[After finding success investing in the more obviously lucrative corners of American medicine—like surgery centers and dermatology practices—private equity firms have moved aggressively into the industry’s more hidden niches: They are pouring billions into the business of clinical drug trials.To bring a new drug to market, the FDA requires pharmaceutical firms to perform extensive studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy, which are often expensive and time-consuming to conduct to the agency’s specifications. Getting a drug to market a few months sooner and for less expense than usual can translate into millions in profit for the manufacturer.That is why a private equity-backed startup like Headlands Research saw an opportunity in creating a network of clinical sites and wringing greater efficiency out of businesses, to perform this critical scientific work faster. And why Moderna, Pfizer, Biogen, and other drug industry bigwigs have been willing to hire it—even though it’s a relatively new player in the field, formed in 2018 by investment giant KKR.In July 2020, Headlands announced it won coveted contracts to run clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, which would include shots for AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer.In marketing its services, Headlands described its mission to “profoundly impact” clinical trials—including boosting participation among racial and ethnic minorities who have long been underrepresented in such research.“We are excited,” CEO Mark Blumling said in a statement, to bring “COVID-19 studies to the ethnically diverse populations represented at our sites.” Blumling, a drug industry veteran with venture capital and private equity experience, told KHN that KKR backed him to start the company, which has grown by buying established trial sites and opening new ones.Finding and enrolling patients is often the limiting and most costly part of trials, said Dr. Marcella Alsan, a public policy professor at Harvard Kennedy School and an expert on diverse representation in clinical trials, which have a median cost of $19 million for new drugs, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.Story continuesBefore COVID hit, Headlands acquired research centers in McAllen, Texas; Houston; metro Atlanta; and Lake Charles, Louisiana, saying those locations would help it boost recruitment of diverse patients—an urgent priority during the pandemic in studying vaccines to ward off a disease disproportionately killing Black, Hispanic, and Native Americans.Headlands’ sites also ran, among other things, clinical studies on treatments to combat Type 2 diabetes, postpartum depression, asthma, liver disease, migraines, endometriosis, according to a review of website archives and the federal website ClinicalTrials.gov. But within two years, some of Headlands’ alluring promises would fall flat.In September, Headlands shuttered locations in Houston—one of the nation’s largest metro areas and home to major medical centers and research universities—and Lake Charles, a move Blumling attributed to problems finding “experienced, highly qualified staff” to carry out the complex and highly specialized work of clinical research. The McAllen site is not taking on new research as Headlands shifts operations to another South Texas location it launched with Pfizer.What impact did those sites have? Blumling declined to provide specifics on whether enrollment targets for COVID vaccine trials, including by race and ethnicity, were met for those locations, citing confidentiality. He noted that for any given trial, data is aggregated across all sites and the drug company sponsoring it is the only entity that has seen the data for each site once the trial is completed.A fragmented clinical trials industry has made it a prime target for private equity, which often consolidates markets by merging companies. But Headlands’ trajectory shows the potential risks of trying to combine independent sites and squeeze efficiency out of studies that will affect the health of millions.Yashaswini Singh, a health economist at Johns Hopkins who has studied private equity acquisitions of physician practices, said consolidation has potential downsides. Singh and her colleagues published research in September analyzing acquisitions in dermatology, gastroenterology, and ophthalmology that found physician practices—a business with parallels to clinical trial companies—charged higher prices after acquisition.“We’ve seen reduced market competition in a variety of settings to be associated with increases in prices, reduction in access and choice for patients, and so on,” Singh said. “So it’s a delicate balance.”Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, called private equity involvement in trials “concerning.”“We need to make sure that patients” know enough to provide “adequate, informed consent,” he said, and ensure “protections about the privacy of the data.”“We don’t want those kinds of things to be lost in the shuffle in the goals of making money,” he said.Blumling said trial sites Headlands acquired are not charging higher prices than before. He said privacy “is one of our highest concerns. Headlands holds itself to the highest standard.”Good or bad, clinical trials have become a big, profitable business in the private equity sphere, data shows.Eleven of the 25 private equity firms identified by industry tracker PitchBook as the top investors in health care have bought stakes in clinical research companies, a KHN analysis found. Those companies have been involved in studies ranging from COVID vaccines to treatments for ovarian cancer, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s.Contracted firms also analyze patient data and prepare materials to secure approval from regulatory agencies, in hopes of getting more drugs to market faster. And a big draw for investors: Clinical research companies make money whether or not a drug succeeds, making it less risky than investing in a drug company.The number of clinical trials has exploded to more than 434,000 registered studies this year as of late November, more than triple the number a decade ago.Still, most trial sites are physician practices that don’t consistently perform studies, according to a presentation by Boston-based investment firm Provident Healthcare Partners.“Independent sites are being purchased by private equity, and they’re moving into larger site groups of 30, 40, and then their game plan is to roll that up into a business and then sell it again,” said Linda Moore Schipani, CEO of Clinical Research Associates, a Nashville-based company that worked on COVID vaccine trials for AstraZeneca, Novavax, and Pfizer. “That’s kind of the endgame.”Headlands is a prime example. It announced in November 2019 that it would acquire six centers in the U.S. and Canada, including three sites in Texas and Louisiana owned by Centex Studies that would help improve participation among Hispanics and African Americans.It has made other acquisitions since then and opened new sites in areas with “extremely limited trial options,” something Blumling says distinguishes his company.“I’m not an evangelist for private equity,” Blumling said. “The ability of KKR to be willing to invest in something that is a three- to five-year return versus a one- to two-year return is something that you won’t see out there.”A research center in Brownsville, Texas—a stone’s throw from the U.S.-Mexico border and where 95% of the population is Hispanic or Latino—is one of several where it is partnering with Pfizer to boost patient diversity.To recruit patients, Headlands “is really going beyond what a lot of sites do, which is social media,” Blumling said in an interview. “It’s going within churches, community fairs, really getting out into as much as possible the broader community.”Headlands closed the Houston and Lake Charles sites because of staffing issues, Blumling said, and finished or moved their studies elsewhere. Blumling said the decision to close those locations “did not have anything to do with the speed of trials.”Similarly, he said, Headlands is moving the McAllen site’s operations to Brownsville “because it had a larger population of trained personnel.”“We want to continue to grow sites and do great work,” Blumling said. “If we can’t find the people in order to do that at the quality that we demand, which is at the highest level, then it doesn’t make sense to keep those sites.”""The writing to me was on the wall”In 2006, Devora Torrence co-founded Centex Studies, which she described as “my little mom and pop business” in a 2021 podcast about female entrepreneurs in science. She said a flurry of interest from private equity came at the end of 2018. The appeal was evident: Drug companies were relying on bigger clinical trial networks.“The thing is speed, getting it to market. With a bigger network, you get that speed,” Torrence said on the podcast. “The writing to me was on the wall that either I get some outside investment and scale up myself, or kind of listen to these guys and see if maybe now would be the right time to exit.”Joining Headlands had its benefits during the pandemic because she could “lean on” its other sites with experience running vaccine trials. “Had we not gotten those … we may not still be here,” Torrence said.Torrence, whose LinkedIn profile said she left the company in 2021, didn’t respond to messages from KHN.Lyndon Fullen, a health care consultant and former Centex employee, said private equity provides funding that allows companies to add study sites.“I completely support it,” he said. “If it’s about reaching that large patient population, it’s of course better to have larger groups with that funding.”Opportunity in long COVIDContract research organization Parexel saw opportunity in the COVID pandemic—millions of people were developing long COVID after infection and there were few, if any, meaningful treatment options.The company, which employs more than 19,000 people, was acquired in 2021 by EQT Private Equity and Goldman Sachs’ private equity arm for $8.5 billion, billions more than the $4.5 billion that private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management paid when it took Parexel private in 2017.A growing body of research shows the debilitating effects of long COVID, including a recent study of tens of thousands of patients in Scotland where nearly half had not fully recovered months later. But treatments addressing its root causes could be years away. “It’s a huge number of people,” said Dr. Nathalie Sohier, who leads Parexel’s infectious diseases and vaccines franchise. “There’s a lot of need.”Long COVID represents the promise and peril of the work to develop new drugs: Millions of patients create a potentially lucrative market for drug companies, and yet researchers and industry experts say they are reluctant to jump in. In part, that’s because “it’s not a well-defined disease, and that really makes it highly risky for companies to invest in research,” said Cecil Nick, a vice president for Parexel.“How are we going to be able to tell the FDA that our drug works? We can’t count the number of people who died; we can’t count the number of people in the hospital,” said Dr. Steven Deeks, a University of California-San Francisco professor who is running an observational study on long COVID patients.As of August, among more than 4,400 COVID studies, only 304 focused on long COVID. A third of those were related to drug development, Sohier said.Sohier said “there are few” companies in its long COVID program. That hasn’t stopped Parexel from pitching itself as the ideal partner to shepherd new products, including by doing regulatory work and using remote technology to retain patients in trials. Parexel has worked on nearly 300 COVID-related studies in more than 50 countries, spokesperson Danaka Williams said.Michael Fenne, research and campaign coordinator with the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, which studies private equity investments, said Parexel and other contract research organizations are beefing up their data capacity. The aim? To have better information on patients.“It kind of ties into access and control of patients,” Fenne said. “Technology makes accessing patients, and then also having more reliable information on them, easier.”KHN senior correspondent Fred Schulte and Megan Kalata contributed to this report.KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

This is not good as insiders invest based on expectations that their money will appreciate over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their original investment is now worth only US$2.5m.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings PayPal Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Vice President of Global Sales, Peggy Alford, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$97.82 per share.

For example, in May 2021, Bitcoin plummeted 50% before rebounding to all-time highs of approximately $69,000 later that year. Bitcoin is forecasted to conclude 2022 at nearly $16,800, down from $19,500 at the peak of the FTX crisis. If more controversy unfolds from FTX’s bankruptcy, Bitcoin can fall even further. Even ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood, who is a popular Bitcoin connoisseur, admitted that financial institutions may reevaluate their crypto strategies in the short-term because of FTX.Despite the volatile and unpredictable nature of the crypto industry, it still manages to contort some major financial rules, which is slowly but surely leading the world to a modern economy. Although the recent global events, FTX collapse, and Bitcoin plunge have impacted the crypto industry, there are retail traders around the world who believe that buying crypto products on the dip will result in a sector recovery. For example, Brazilian investors are indicating a solid proclivity for crypto even as the global industry is crashing down, with an unpredictable future ahead. Brazilians are trusting crypto assets over conventional financial investment products like equities and precious metals. Data from a November survey by Finbold indicates that 33% of Brazilian investors intend to purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin within the next 12 months. Cryptocurrency ranks as the top investment, followed by real estate at 26%, and stocks took up the third place at 22%.Some of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Our Methodology These are the most popular crypto stocks among the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the third quarter of 2022.

CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is an American company that runs the biggest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading in several asset classes such as agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes, and cryptocurrencies futures. On November 10, CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) declared a $1.00 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 28, to shareholders of record on December 9. On October 27, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell raised the price target on CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) to $202 from $200 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares following the ""good"" Q3 report.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 60 hedge funds were bullish on CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) at the end of September 2022, compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. GuardCap Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 4.18 million shares worth $740.4 million. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is one of the premier crypto stocks to watch. Baron Funds made the following comment about CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) operates the world’s largest and most diversified derivatives marketplace. Shares fell 13% during the quarter (despite reporting strong average daily trading volume growth of 26% year-over year) due to concerns that EPS growth will slow in 2023 as the rate hike cycle comes to an end. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats, its product breadth and liquidity depth, its durable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures, and tailwinds from the rising rate environment.”9. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational firm that specializes in payment card services. In June 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) disclosed that Abra Crypto Card on the American Express network will transact in U.S. dollars and offer crypto back on any purchase category. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best crypto stocks to buy according to smart investors. Based on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)’s performance to date, the management continues to expect full-year revenue growth of 23% to 25% versus a 25.24% consensus and now stands by its initial full-year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65, compared to a $9.84 consensus.On November 29, Redburn analyst Fahed Kunwar initiated coverage of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) with a Neutral rating. The brand power of debit is declining as digital wallets become popular, contended the analyst, who believes the market underestimates the cyclical and structural concerns pressuring card network stocks.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 68 hedge funds were bullish on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 67 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 151.6 million shares worth $20.45 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.”8. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), a California-based computer technology and semiconductor company, is one of the best crypto stocks to monitor. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced in April 2022 its new Intel Blockscale ASIC, offering energy efficient hashing for proof-of-work consensus networks. Intel Blockscale ASIC will provide the energy efficiency and computing power needed to deliver scalable and sustainable operations. On November 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh resumed coverage of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) with a Neutral rating and a $32 price target. Since his earlier research note on February 18, the analyst thinks Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has seen higher challenges in both the server and PC markets, with server CPU ramps delayed to 2023 and weaker PC demand. While Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is regaining some share in PCs, in the core high margin server/data center segment it continues to expect market share loss into 2023, the analyst told investors.According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 69 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 funds in the last quarter worth $2.5 billion. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 15.15 million shares valued at $390.5 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”7. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a multinational financial technology company that serves the financial services, mobile payments, and point of sale industries. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s Cash App makes it convenient to invest in stocks and Bitcoin. In Q3 2022, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s gross profit outperformed Street estimates on the strength of its Cash App and Seller systems, but was partly offset by weaker Buy Now Pay Later gross profit. On November 16, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev raised the price target on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) to $69 from $57 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst said payday lending is largely significant to Cash App gross profit growth. Payday lending is a short-term boost to inflows, but it may eventually pressure Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s multiple as delinquencies across consumer lending continue to increase, the analyst wrote in a research note. This is concerning given Cash App's skew towards lower-income households, added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) at the end of September, compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), with a position worth $505.45 million. It is one of the best crypto stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund include Wells Fargo.”6. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a digital payments company that offers financial technology solutions under the PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, Zettle, Hyperwallet, Honey, and Paidy brands. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced in August 2022 that users can transfer crypto from PayPal to external crypto addresses for no network charges. In the PYMNTS survey -- Black Friday 2022: High Prices Reshape Holiday Shopping Habits, November 2022, Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri noted that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), an Outperform rated stock, remained a dominant e-commerce payment option.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 126 hedge funds were bullish on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 17.6 million shares worth $1.5 billion.In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the favorite crypto stocks among smart investors. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in e-commerce driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins.

If you want to read about some more aggressive stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Aggressive Stocks to Buy Now.Aggressive stocks are high-risk, high-reward growth stocks that can provide investors with strong returns. Growth stocks offer a substantially higher growth rate as opposed to the mean growth rate prevailing in the market. This is indicated by the historical outperformance of prominent growth names like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) over the past few years, despite economic crises and macro slowdowns. In simple terms, growth stocks are companies that are growing their share prices, revenue, profits or cash flow at faster rates than the market at large. Despite the relatively stable income from dividends, investors choose growth stocks to earn profits, preferring them over value offerings keeping in mind the trends at the market. Phil Kernen, a portfolio manager with Mitchell Capital, says that growth stocks represent those companies that exhibit strong revenue and earnings growth rates, irrespective of what the economy is doing around them. The best growth stocks are those that take an existing idea and figure out how to scale it in a meaningful way.Is it time to buy the dip on growth stocks?These aggressive stocks often look expensive, trading at a high P/E ratio, but such valuations could actually be cheap if the company continues to grow rapidly which will increase the share price. Companies which have aggressive stocks have unique product lines. By using technologies, these companies compete in the market. To increase their growth in industry, companies reinvest their profits to develop even new technologies and give their investors a good benefit in shares and have long term growth. Investors expect to gain a significant capital gain on the growth stock in a company. This can lead the stocks to be overvalued because of their high price to earnings ratio. Companies which offer growth stocks have innovative patterns and loyal customers. Companies which have the potential to manage and attract more customers may become the growth stock. Many small-cap stocks are considered growth stocks. However, some larger companies may also be growth companies.Story continuesGrowth stocks seem like an aggressive buy right now considering the macro-economic environment in which inflation and rising rates are slowing down the economy. However, it might be the time to buy the dip on these growth names. According to a report by Forbes Advisor, buying the dip is a valid investment strategy in present conditions. Poppy Fox, who is investment manager at Quilter Cheviot, says that there can be some sound logic in buying shares of companies after their price takes a tumble, particularly if you continue to believe in the core investment case for these companies. Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe companies that operate in the growth sector and have upcoming growth catalysts were selected for the list.

Adjusted net income is anticipated to be more than $28.95 per share, higher than the prior outlook of greater than $28.70.However, the company's escalating costs continue to put pressure on margins.

If you want to see more good stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.A good stock to buy is a stock of a strong company that can grow earnings in the future.Although a good stock to buy might decline in the near term, there would be a good chance that the good stock to buy would be higher in the long term given the company's normalized earnings potential and its competitive advantages. Ideally a good stock to buy would trade for a fair or attractive valuation.Many good stocks to buy have historically been leading blue chips that have increased their earnings per share over time. Many of the same stocks make it to the Dividend Aristocrats list where the company has increased its annual dividend for 25 years or more. Many good stocks to buy also return capital back to shareholders through share repurchases. Good stocks to buy are generally less volatile than the general market although there can be exceptions.Given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates significantly this year, the broader market has declined substantially with the S&amp;P 500 down 15% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6% year to date. Many stocks, including good stocks to buy, have also declined substantially as well. As a result, some blue chips with competitive advantages trade for fairly attractive valuations if the economy can grow as expected.Recently, stocks have increased due to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments that the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates at a slower pace.Nevertheless, Powell also said the central bank will still raise rates until it defeats inflation. He added, ""Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.""If economic data fails to meet expectations, the good stocks to buy could decline even further. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesTrump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now, we picked 15 companies with the right mix of scale, competitive advantages, and earnings growth potential.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stocks at the end of Q3 2022.15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now15.

Although the company's earnings might not meet expectations next year if there is a recession, analysts believe JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) will grow its EPS in the long term given its growing market share and its earnings power.Vltava Fund commented on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.Click to continue reading and see 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.Suggested articles:Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksObama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year ReturnsAQR Capital’s Performance, AUM and Top Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.8%. See our latest analysis for McCormick McCormick's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. The last dividend was quite comfortably covered by McCormick's earnings, but it was a bit tighter on the cash flow front. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 32.7%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 48% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendMcCormick Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.62 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.56. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.7% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that McCormick has been growing its earnings per share at 7.2% a year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.Our Thoughts On McCormick's DividendOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Let me pull up our industrials map. There we go. And here's Boeing, up 24% for the month. And I'm going to dial this down to a two-year chart. The plane giant is nearing a deal with United Airlines to buy dozens of 787 Dreamliners. No parties are commenting on the record.But Boeing competitor Airbus reportedly in the running for some of the orders. The Dreamliner sports a $300 million price tag. It's noted for its fuel efficiency and ability to make long haul routes in a single stop without the need to refuel. And the deal, if it goes through, would be a major win for Boeing, which has been beset by setbacks since those two 737 MAX planes crashed in 2018 and 2019.This is a two-year chart. Just want to show you, this chart right here is showing a breakout, very nascent breakout on a longer term basis. It could mean something. When you take a look at the other industrial companies here over the last month, Boeing is actually one of the big leaders. I got some materials companies thrown in there, too, but if readers will remember-- viewers will remember all the way back to 2017, this was the stock market in 2017. Of course, that was in the past-- not so much anymore.DAVE BRIGGS: Very interesting to watch them against their competition. Boeing had dominated that category that the Dreamliner plays in, so it's a big win against them, but they've taken very different paths to the same place, which is both down 12% year to date in a year where travel truly has bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. All right.]"

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Ross Stores (ROST) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ROST for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Ross Stores' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Ross Stores' main business drivers.Based in Dublin, CA, Ross Stores Inc. operates as an off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories, primarily in the United States. The company operates its stores under the Ross Dress for Less (Ross) and dd’s DISCOUNTS names. The company’s stores are located mostly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas.Ross Stores primarily offers in-season, branded, and designer apparel, footwear, accessories and other home-related merchandise for everyone in the family. This format primarily targets middle-income households. Prices offered at Ross are generally 20% to 60% below the regular prices of most department and specialty stores.dd’s DISCOUNTS features more moderately-priced first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. These stores target moderate-income households. The dd’s DISCOUNTS stores offer products at a 20% to 70% lesser price than the moderate department and discount stores.Ross Stores remains focused with its store expansion initiatives over the years. Further, the company’s efforts to expand base by making efforts to increase penetration in the existing as well as new markets. In this regard, it opened 26 stores across nine different states in February and March.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, 2022, Ross Stores operated 2,019 outlets, including 1,696 Ross stores across 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, and 323 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Ross Stores, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in December 2012 would be worth $4,134.14, or a gain of 313.41%, as of December 2, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 187.86% and the price of gold went up 1.08% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for ROST too.Ross Stores has outpaced the industry in the past three months, courtesy of improved SG&amp;A expense, sequential gains at dd’s DISCOUNTS and favorable traffic trends, which aided third-quarter fiscal 2022 results. The company reported top and bottom line beat in the fiscal third quarter. The decline in incentive costs resulted in lower SG&amp;A expense during the quarter. It has been benefiting from the execution of its store expansion plans over the years. It provided an upbeat view for Q4 and fiscal 2022. However, the company’s fiscal third quarter results were impacted by ongoing financial pressures on dd’s customers and increased markdowns, resulting in year over year decline in sales and earnings. In Q4, it expects the highly promotional holiday season and inflationary costs to put pressure on low-to-moderate income customers.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 27.82%, and there have been 9 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Both stocks largely outperformed the benchmark’s +258% during this period.Pivoting to valuation will give a better idea if the recent rally in these equities can be sustained and possibly provide investors with the stellar returns seen over the last decade.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation Visa has a “B” grade for Value in Zacks Style Scores system with Mastercard at a “C”.Visa stock currently trades at 26.1X forward earnings, and nicely below the decade-high of 44.1X.

However, this is beneath its decade-long high of 55.2X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile Mastercard shares have enjoyed better price performance, Visa stock appears to offer a slightly better discount. The price-to-earnings valuation of both companies indicates there could be more upside in the stocks. Growth Estimates   Turning to growth will help justify a further rebound. Visa’s current fiscal year 2023 earnings and revenue are forecasted to climb 10% and 9%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesMastercard’s earnings are projected to jump 26% in FY22 with sales expected to rise 17% as shown in the charts below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBoth companies continue to have solid growth trajectories.

It may be worth holding on to shares as both stocks trade attractively relative to their past. Top and Bottom line growth are poised to continue at both financial services firms despite earnings estimate revisions slightly down from last quarter.These stocks also offer modest dividends to reward patient investors.

A stock buyback occurs when a company elects to purchase outstanding shares of its stock, essentially re-investing in itself.There are several reasons buybacks can occur - companies have decided to utilize excess cash, want to limit dilution caused by employee stock option programs, or simply because they believe their shares are undervalued.Three companies have recently announced new stock buyback programs, including Visa V, Walmart WMT, and United Rentals, Inc. URI.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.WalmartWalmart’s product offerings include almost everything from grocery to cosmetics, electronics to stationery, home furnishings to health and wellness products, and apparel to entertainment products, to name a few.The company has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn its latest earnings release (Q3), WMT approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing its existing authorization that had approximately $1.9 billion remaining at the end of the quarter.The company has managed to string together better-than-expected results in a harsh backdrop, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in back-to-back quarters.In its Q3, WMT delivered a 13% bottom-line beat paired with a 3.7% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisaA multinational financial services company, Visa facilitates electronic funds transfers through Visa-branded debit, credit, and prepaid cards.In Visa’s latest earnings release (Q4), the company authorized a new $12 billion share repurchase program and raised its quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.45 per share.Story continuesThe company’s annual dividend currently yields 0.8%, just a tick below its Zacks Business Services sector average. Still, the company’s 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate is undoubtedly strong.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s hard to ignore V’s free cash flow strength; in its Q4, the company reported free cash flow of $5.6 billion, reflecting a nearly 50% Y/Y uptick.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited RentalsUnited Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of rental locations in the United States, Canada, and Europe.Like WMT, United Rentals has seen its near-term earnings outlook turn positive over the last several months, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Rentals unveiled a new $1.25 billion share repurchase program in its latest earnings release (Q3), following the company’s prior $1 billion share buyback that was completed.Further, URI doesn’t carry stretched valuation multiples; the company’s shares currently trade at a 10.9X forward earnings multiple, a few ticks above its 10.6X five-year median and below its Zacks Construction sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI sports a Style Score of “A” for Value.Bottom LineA common way that companies can boost shareholder value is through share buybacks. In its simplest form, the company is essentially re-investing in itself.In addition, it can provide a nice confidence boost for investors, with the buybacks indicating that the company is utilizing its excess cash and not just hoarding it.And in the face of a challenging economic backdrop in 2022, companies willing to dish out extra cash can be hard to find.All three stocks above – Visa V, Walmart WMT, and United Rentals, Inc. URI – have all unveiled new repurchase programs as of late in an attempt to maximize shareholder value.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

217,9260c6cb-af3e-3377-9d6a-cc849f72f6e3,V,2022-12-03,Mastercard: An All-Weather Performer for Every Kind of Investor,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-weather-performer-every-kind-155306711.html,1669996386,STORY,"['MA', 'GOOGL', 'V', 'SABR']","[Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is the second-biggest payment processing company in the U.S., just behind its rival Visa (NYSE:V). During the past four quarters, it processed 8.2 trillion transactions. That number is expected to grow in the coming years as the world moves towards a cashless society.Mastercard has been at the forefront of this transition, and it's not slowing down just because it's no longer a startup. For example, it's been partnering with Alphabet's (GOOG)(GOOGL) Google to introduce the Google Wallet in different regions.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MA. Click here to check it out. MA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MAPeter Lynch Chart of MAConsidering its current market dominance and the potential for growth in other areas, Mastercard will likely continue to do well in my opinion. Although there are several fintech disruptors aiming to take its place, Mastercard is holding its own and is still minting money. The company has shown resilience and an ability to change, which bodes well for its long-term prospects. While there is always the risk of new entrants into the market, Mastercard has established itself as a leader and is well-positioned to weather any storms that may come its way.Moving to a cashless worldMastercard recently inked an agreement with Sabre Corp. (NASDAQ:SABR) and Conferma Pay which involves Mastercard making a minority investment in Conferma. By partnering with Mastercard, Sabre can improve its virtual card offerings and expand its geographic reach. This also expands the customer base for both companies.Grand View Research estimates that the global virtual card market could be worth over $11 billion in 2021, and it's expected to grow by 20.7% every year until 2030. Travel spending of $260 billion in a year is managed by Sabre, which has customers in 160 countries and has a network of more than 700 companies, worldwide distribution systems and online booking platforms. With this partnership, Mastercard can access all of that, which will generate growth for its Digital First program.Story continuesGoogle alliance and its implicationsMastercard holders of accounts in the CIMB Bank Berhad and Hong Leong Bank Berhad in Malaysia will now be able to utilize Googe Wallet due to an agreement signed between it and Google in early November. Mastercard's decision needs to be seen in the context of its overall goal to become a leader in digital payments. The e-Conomy SEA 2022 report shows that the gross value of these transactions is projected to rise to $200 billion by 2025.Many people in the region are buying goods and paying for services online due to increased smartphone access. This move will allow Mastercard to tap into this growing market and provide its customers with more convenient and secure payment options. In addition, this partnership will help to further establish Mastercard as a leading player in the global payments industry. This is a great step forward for Mastercard, which has also introduced Google Wallet in South Africa.Mastercard's financial results continue to impressIn the third quarter, Mastercard's net revenue jumped 15% from the year-ago period to $5.8 billion due to resilient consumer spending. This demonstrates both the increase in cashless transactions and the business model's built-in inflation protection. Cross-border volume increased by 41% to $1.8 billion, and the cross-border volume fee went up by 57% as international travel has started to return to normal levels. Mastercard had previously been experiencing a decline in revenue due to limited international travel. However, as more people have already caught Covid, the payment-processing corporation expects international travel to return to its pre-pandemic levels slowly.Mastercard's operating expenses rose by 17%, including personnel, acquisition, advertisement and other investments. However, the figure is not discouraging as adjusted earnings per share jumped by 22% year over year to $2.68, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The company's free cash was $3.579 billion, and comparing it to the current debt at only $957 million, we can see the balance sheet is strong. Mastercard paid $120 million in interest expenses in the quarter, which is not a big deal considering the company's bottom line.Mastercard paid $474 million in dividends in the third quarter and has a forward dividend yield of 0.57%. While not much, it's better than nothing. Furthermore, in the third quarter, the company repurchased $1.6 billion worth of shares and made an additional repurchase of $505 million worth of shares throughout October. The three-year average share buyback ratio is 1.7%.TakeawayMastercard is a company that always done well even in recessions due to how lucrative its business model is. The company may be old, but it is aggressively expanding geographically and adding new services to try and stay ahead of its competitors. The stock has been a long-term money minter for investors, and I don't think that's likely to change any time soon.The global payments industry is vast and continually growing as the world economy expands and developing countries begin to go cashless. Mastercard is positioned to benefit greatly as people become more comfortable with using digital payment methods.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Take a look at wheat futures. You will see a year-to-date here-- wheat futures relatively flat for the year. Oat futures are down 47% year-to-date. Even coffee futures are lower year-to-date, down 27%.So what is happening here? Because people are not seeing these lower prices in commodities translate to their grocery bills. You've got food inflation that is up roughly 12% year-over-year. Well, food producers, they're hesitant to lower their prices because of uncertainty when it comes to grain-- often, that output, grains are planted for the following year.So there's been a lot of turmoil with the situation with Ukraine. Also, the energy prices-- those are still relatively high, even though they have come off their highs. But energy is a big factor when it comes to food, especially when you're talking about farmers planting.They use diesel, and diesel has not come off its prices as much as gasoline has from their highs from earlier this year. Farmers use diesel, and also transportation is in diesel as well. So a lot of this takes about 3 to six months to translate into grocery bills.I did speak to a produce producer who was telling me that the prices at shipping points, those are down. But that doesn't reflect on the wholesale prices or supermarket prices also, because that takes time. There's a lag there as well, because you also have inventory at supermarkets that you need to clear out first before you bring in those other products, guys.]"

You can see on the intraday or intranight price action. This is since midnight, really taking a dive here on that report.Let's check out the NASDAQ, which is now down more than that. Basically, double the Dow, down 2 and 1/4%. Very similar chart right there.And let's just check in on what some of the other markets and the futures are doing. Gold took a little bit of a dive here. You can see now it had been in the green. Now, in the red for about 1%. Interestingly, it had perked up over the last few days.So gold, a lot of people pointing to the fact that it could be on the verge of a breakout while it's breaking out here. That has been on a decline in real rates. But that may be reversing right now.So let's take a look at some of the currency action as well. And in particular, I want to check out the euro because that has been fluctuating around some key levels here. And let me put this on an intraday basis. And you would expect-- yeah, we see the euro weakening and the dollar strengthening on the move.That's as people believe the Fed's longer-- or higher for longer or at least staying the course for a little bit longer. I think that hot wage growth number really putting a damper on equities here.And a little bit tongue and cheek, we've got to take-- check out Bitcoin because Bitcoin has been highly levered to a lot of these economic reports and what the central banks may be doing. Not a lot of action right there.So I'm gonna round this out with a look at copper futures. And then finally, we can see copper heading down as well.And just want to get a check on the interest rate situation. 10-year Treasury note futures really selling off right now, which means interest rates are rising. So a little bit of a hot report there, especially in terms of that wage number, guys.]"

But price per share alone is hardly a good reason to buy a stock, even of a well-known wireless carrier.TMobile TMUS, meanwhile, is expected to see expansive growth but is trading around $152 per share.Let’s see how AT&amp;T (T), Verizon (VZ), and TMobile (TMUS) stocks compare and which may be the better buy at the moment.Recent Performance Over the last year, both AT&amp;T and Verizon Stock have lagged behind the S&amp;P 500, while TMobile has strongly outperformed the benchmark.AT&amp;T &amp; VZ are down -19% and -26%, respectively YTD vs. the S&amp;P 500’s -15%. On the other hand, TMUS is up an impressive +30%. TMUS has been the leader here, with AT&amp;T and Verizon closer to the Nasdaq’s bearish performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, over the last three months, AT&amp;T’s stock has an edge, up +10% vs. TMUS’s +7% and VZ’s -8%. AT&amp;T’s recent momentum is mostly attributed to the company’s spinoff of Warner Bros. Discovery WBD and refocus on its core wireless business.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation Turning to valuation, both AT&amp;T and Verizon sport an “A” for Value in Zacks Style Scores system to top TMobile’s “C"".AT&amp;T shares currently trade at 7.2X forward earnings, nicely below their decade-high of 15.3X. This is on par with VZ’s 7.3X. VZ also trades at a solid discount to its decade-high of 19.2X.On the contrary, TMUS shares trade at a 74.3X forward earnings multiple, which is well below its decade-high of 755X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn terms of valuation from a price-to-earnings perspective, AT&amp;T and Verizon stocks are more attractive vs. TMUS. Verizon appears to have a slight edge over AT&amp;T as it trades further beneath its decade high.Growth &amp; Outlook Pivoting to growth will help get a better indication of which stock is the better buy in addition to their current valuations.Story continuesLike the broader economy, most telecom companies are dealing with tougher operating conditions amid higher inflation.AT&amp;T’s current fiscal year earnings and revenue are expected to decline -23% and -30%, respectively.However, earnings estimate revisions for this year and FY23 have risen over the last 90 days. Fiscal 2022 earnings are now projected at $2.62 per share compared to $2.53 a share last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTaking a look at Verizon in the chart below, this year’s earnings are expected to decline -4% with sales up 2%.Earnings estimates for fiscal 2022 and FY23 have slightly declined. FY22 earnings are now forecasted to be $5.19 per share compared to $5.20 last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTMobile’s earnings are expected to drop -23% this year with sales virtually flat. Earnings estimate revisions have declined for FY22 but trended higher for FY23. EPS of $2.00 is now expected this year, down from $2.15 a share 90 days ago.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTMUS earnings are expected to see substantial growth in FY23 as shown in the above chart. Fiscal 2023 EPS is expected to jump 233% to $6.66 per share and up from $6.33 a share last quarter.Bottom Line Despite TMobile’s impressive FY23 growth outlook, AT&amp;T appears to have the edge over TMUS and VZ stock with T’s earnings estimate revisions trending up this year and in FY23. In correlation to climbing earnings revisions AT&amp;T stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while TMobile and Verizon land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This gives the overall edge to AT&amp;T as its stock trades more attractively than TMobile from a valuation standpoint. To that note, Verizon’s earnings estimate revisions have slightly declined despite its attractive valuation.Even better, AT&amp;T’s annual dividend yield at 5.78% is respectable compared to Verizon’s 6.81% because both are very high. Meanwhile, TMobile does not offer a dividend at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Rivas, an avid golfer and insurance broker based in Los Angeles, CA, conceived of a product that would easily keep a ball marker right where he needed it while playing-namely, at his fingertips. Rivas is a leftie, and saw a need for a magnet patch that you can place anywhere on your hat, rather than using the mainly right-sided, sewn-in cap magnets on the market.Working with his business partner and girlfriend, Gia Mora, a full-time artist and writer, Rivas launched The Original Cap Magnet. The product is a flexible magnet that fits neatly into any hat (not just golf caps) or even in a shoe or golf bag.But because of the nature of the product-it's meant to be unseen, wherever you wear it-the Cap Magnet was tricky to market.

(VZ) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-verizon-communications-140002101.html,1669989602,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +3.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has gained 1.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.19 points to a change of -3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.10 indicates a change of -1.7% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $35.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.5%. The $136.86 billion and $139.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.4% and +1.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $34.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +3.13%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TPR) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Tapestry's shares on or after the 8th of December, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 27th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.30 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.20 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Tapestry has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current stock price of $38.81. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Tapestry has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Tapestry Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Tapestry paid out a comfortable 32% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 47% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Tapestry's earnings per share have been growing at 10% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Tapestry has increased its dividend at approximately 2.9% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Tapestry? It's great that Tapestry is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's disappointing to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, but as things stand now, the low payout ratio suggests a conservative approach to dividends, which we like. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.While it's tempting to invest in Tapestry for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Tapestry that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 65% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 3.7% increase in share prices after a year of 45% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NVIDIA. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NVIDIA. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.2% and 5.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$17b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 31% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Coinbase Global Inc. Ordinary Shares (NASDAQ:COIN) fell during the quarter as the crypto markets continued to suffer. While the company reported disappointing results, it committed to capping EBITDA losses at $500M even in the event of “a prolonged market downturn”. COIN’s ample liquidity ($6b in cash on hand) should enable them to survive a prolonged “crypto winter” and invest to strengthen the business in the downturn. While the crypto market is early in its adoption, Coinbase is focused on building the platform for crypto not only supporting trading, and cold storage, but moving into NFTs, staking, and crypto derivatives. We see tremendous upside potential for COIN over the next decade if they are able to successfully execute on their platform strategy.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blockchain Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:15 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income12 Safest Stocks To Invest In15 Best E-Commerce Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Blockchain Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

It may seem that AI has gained significant popularity in numerous sectors, but overall the industry is still in its infancy. Experts believe that the automotive, financial services, and healthcare sectors have the greatest potential to benefit from the enhancements in AI. However, this requires strategic and focused investment in different areas of AI technology.In the automotive sector, the applicability of AI will expand through the increase in autonomous fleets for ride-sharing.

Meanwhile, improvement is also taking place in the field of engine monitoring, which would assist in predicting maintenance. Similarly, AI is coming into play in the healthcare sector by supporting diagnosis and highlighting small variations from the baseline. In addition, AI’s power can be used to identify pandemics at an early stage. Finally, AI is expected to play a part in personalized financial planning in the financial services sector.

MCK, Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH and Super Micro Computer, Inc.

Let's take a closer look at each one.Cardinal Health, Inc.Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers, and manufacturers. The company has two reporting segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Undoubtedly a major positive, Cardinal Health belongs to the elite Dividend Aristocrat group; Dividend Aristocrats are classified as companies with at least 25 consecutive annual dividend increases.CAH's annual dividend currently yields roughly 2.5%, above its Zacks Medical sector by a fair margin. In 2022, dividends have become a hot topic, helping shield investors.The company has a solid growth profile as well, with earnings forecasted to climb 4.2% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 14% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 9% in FY23 and 7.3% in FY24.McKesson Corp.

It has already spent or committed roughly 73% of the capacity.The company, in October 2021, completed the asset acquisition and project financing transactions of the $12-billion Jazan project in in Saudi Arabia. It expects to close the Phase Two of this project in 2023.Last year, it also announced the $4.5 billion world-class clean energy complex in Louisiana. The project, the company’s largest-ever investment, is expected to produce more than 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen for local and global markets by 2026.Air Products, in April 2020, also completed the buyout of five steam methane reformer hydrogen production plants for $530 million from PBF Energy. The PBF deal is expected to be accretive to the company’s bottom line.Air Products, in Apr 2022, also purchased Air Liquide's industrial gases business in the United Arab Emirates (""UAE""), including liquid bulk, packaged gases and specialty gases. APD also acquired Air Liquide's majority share in MECD, which owns and operates a liquid CO2 manufacturing site in Bahrain. By purchasing these businesses, Air Products broadened its footprint and regional presence in the UAE and Bahrain.Story continuesThe company is also boosting productivity to improve its cost structure. It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to support its margins moving ahead. Air Products also has been benefiting from higher pricing. Higher merchant demand is also driving its volumes.Air Products also remains committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong balance sheet and cash flows. The company, earlier this year, increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.62 per share from $1.50 per share. This marked the 40th straight year of dividend increase. The company expects to pay more than $1.4 billion of dividend to shareholders in calendar 2022.A Few HeadwindsAir Products is exposed to challenges from cost inflation. It is witnessing higher power costs in its merchant business. The company is seeing significantly higher energy costs, especially in EMEA due to the considerably high natural gas and electricity costs. It is expected to continue to face headwinds from the power cost inflation moving ahead. As such, higher power costs are likely to weigh on margins over the near term.The company also faces headwinds from unfavorable currency translation. It witnessed significant currency headwinds in the last reported quarter, especially in Europe. Currency translation, stemming from a stronger U.S. dollar, reduced its sales by around 6% and EBITDA by 5% in the quarter and lowered its earnings by 15 cents per share.In Europe, all major currencies were weaker vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar by double-digits in the quarter. The company sees continued currency headwinds moving ahead. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Price and Consensus Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

But that’s in the middle range. There are plenty of ways to spend big or cut costs on your visit.GOBankingRates put together tips for two options for your Disney World Trip, whether you’re traveling solo, as a couple or family. Check out some of the ways to go cheap or go all-out.When To TravelRemember that Disney World ticket prices are based on what day you visit. Higher-demand times (weekends, holidays, school vacations such as spring break) are generally more expensive.One-day admission tickets range between $109 to $159, and those prices drop with longer stays. A 5-day ticket starts at $91 per day, and a 10-day ticket starts at $56 per day. If you’re trying for thrifty travel, consider a slightly longer stay and plan to visit during off-peak times. Disney occasionally runs special offers, so be sure to look for those.When cost is no object, you can pick one-day passes at peak times (although you’ll need to worry about crowds). Consider adding the Park Hopper upgrade that allows you to go between different parks after 2 PM on the same day. The most expensive upgrade, the Park Hopper Plus, gives guests access to other activities such as the Blizzard Beach water park. A 1-day ticket with the Park Hopper Plus option currently ranges from $189-244 per person.Take Our Poll: How Long Do You Think It Will Take You To Pay Off Your Credit Card Debt?Where To StayThe major question about where to stay on a Disney World trip is whether to stay on property, at a Disney-owned hotel, or off the property.Hotels on the Disney properties are certainly more convenient for getting to the parks, but they’re generally more expensive. A deluxe resort at Walt Disney World can cost from $574 per night, according to the Disney World website. They are generally closer to the parks, with bigger rooms and better restaurants.Story continuesIf you want to splurge, consider the Atrium Club Level at the Contemporary Resort, starting at $870 per night. Booking rooms or suites with Club Level Service gives you access to a great hotel, plus a concierge staff and secured key access to the club-level lounge for refreshments.If you’re a Star Wars fan, consider the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser Adventure. Not only are you able to spend 2-nights in a Galactic Starcruiser, but your entire group can enjoy ongoing, immersive and interactive entertainment during the 2-day adventure. This intergalactic stay for four people (three adults, 1 child) costs $749 per guest, per night.Other options include moderate and value resorts, which are better values. Value resorts can be as low as $202 per night, but they tend to be the furthest resorts from the parks.You can often book your hotels directly through Disney, and that’s a budget-friendly move if they are offering discounts. There are a number of resort discounts available, including savings of up to $400 on a 4-Day Room-and-Ticket Package at select Disney Resort Hotels for bookings through March 2023.If you choose not to stay on a Disney property, you can find plenty of other hotels in the area, with varying costs – and don’t forget you’ll need transportation to and from the theme parks. Two other possibilities include AirBnB rentals or even camping.DiningAnother way you can go all-out or be thrifty is with your food at Disney World. You can bring your own food into the park to save money or splurge on the dining options within the Disney properties.In-park dining experiences range wildly depending on where you go. Quick-service restaurants will be the most cost-effective at around $20 per meal, per adult, while multi-course character dining experiences will cost you $60+. Kids’ meals are slightly cheaper, running closer to $12 per meal.Outside of the parks, there are plenty of dining experiences available at Disney’s resort hotels for their guests.Additional PerksIf you’re not working off a budget, consider adding ticketed events like the “Keys to the Kingdom” or other backstage tours. These can be perfect for an “insider” look at the park. “Keys to the Kingdom” is currently $114 per person.Buying SouvenirsDon’t forget money for souvenirs, T-shirts and more. If you’re looking to save money, consider shopping at stores that are off-site. Many of the local stores near the parks will sell authorized merchandise at a fraction of what similar items will cost at the theme park. You can also visit the Disney store in the Premium Outlet mall for discounted merchandise.If money is no object, the theme parks have plenty of options! And because you’re shopping at Disney, you’ll be able to find items you can’t get anywhere else.More From GOBankingRates10 Jaw-Dropping Stats About the State of Retirement in AmericaGOBankingRates' Best Credit Cards for 20233 Easy Tips to Turn Your Credit Woes into Wows7 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 2 Ways To Do Disney World: Extravagant and On the Cheap]"

DeSantis denies re-examining Disney’s Reedy Creek special tax district,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/florida-gov-desantis-denies-examining-215627649.html,1670018187,VIDEO,['DIS'],"[Yahoo Finance media reporter Allie Canal outlines the latest developments surrounding the terms regarding Disney's special tax district in Florida, while also discussing prospective acquisition deals for Disney and its blockbuster lineups from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis denying reports that state lawmakers are backtracking on their fight to strip the theme park of its special tax district. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is here with the details. Allie, you've been following this story for quite some time now. DeSantis disputing this report. But what can you tell us?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, he said it on ""Tucker Carlson"" on Tuesday. He said Disney ultimately brought this on itself. And then in a statement provided to NBC News, he said there will be no U-turns on this decision. Now, to just back this up, for those that don't know what the Reedy Creek District is, it basically allows Disney to operate as a self-governing entity. So it prevents them from paying certain taxes. They don't have to follow certain regulation. And sources that I've spoken with have said it's basically like a Vatican with mouse ears. So that's one way to think about it.Now, DeSantis stripping this right from Disney, it could have implications to the citizens in the surrounding counties, Orange County, Osceola County, because Reedy Creek has nearly $1 billion worth of bond debt, some $163 million in annual tax payments. And that throws those payments into question. Ultimately, who is going to pay for this? So it's this push and pull with lawmakers and then also Disney.Now, Bob Iger was asked about this during the town hall. He said he's still looking into this and to what could come of it, but that ultimately Florida is very important into Disney. Disney is very important to Florida. And again, this all has to do with that controversial Don't Say Gay bill that went into effect on July 1. And if this bill is not reversed, it's going to go into effect in June of 2023. And the financial consequences of that for Disney as a business is unknown.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: And it's not entirely clear if Iger would have played that differently at all. But we do know he has that deft touch that is legendary that maybe he can smooth that over. Because ultimately, Florida residents may be hurt by taking away that tax [INAUDIBLE]. But still on Disney, the ""Hollywood Reporter"" with some intriguing M&amp;A activity, some ""far-fetched"" proposals. Are any of them possible?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Some of them are possible. I think the majority are not. The ""Hollywood Reporter"" laid out, could Disney sell to Apple? Iger said that's pure speculation. In terms of the Netflix acquisition, to me, Disney and Netflix are the leaders in this space. I think if we're going to see any streaming M&amp;A in 2023, it's going to be from those smaller players, maybe Paramount and NBCUniversal.Now, this is interesting with the Roblox, Epic Games acquisition. Remember that Disney did wade into the world of gaming. Under Iger's leadership, they tried some in-house gaming. But it was an epic, epic fail. So I don't think Iger will want to revisit that during his short theoretical two-year tenure at the company. But in terms of the future of Hulu, this is going to be the biggest one because of the timeline. Disney is currently on track by 2024 to buy out Comcast's 33% stake in the company. And that would value the streamer at $27.5 billion.Now, a lot of investors on the Street are actually saying that Disney should sell this because it could contribute to a very high bidding war. Disney is desperate for cash right now. And again, because of that two-year timeline for Iger, that's something that he will probably have to figure out. And then when it comes to the ESPN spinoff, that's up in the air. Sports is expensive. But it also drives a lot of profitability for Disney.DAVE BRIGGS: I watched an interview with Jimmy Pitaro this week, and it is clear they are simpatico. Bob Iger and Jimmy Pitaro are tight. They talk almost daily. They talk sometimes just about sports. Iger hired Pitaro. I think they're pretty locked in together right now.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And the brand, the ESPN brand, is just--SEANA SMITH: It's huge.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --iconic.SEANA SMITH: And yeah, so valuable there to the company. Allie, let's talk about some of the upcoming movies that we have for next year in terms of potential bright spots here for Disney in the 12 months.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, in 2023, we're entering phase 5 of the MCU. That means we have an ""Ant-Man"" sequel. We have ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3,"" ""The Marvels."" And then outside of the MCU, there's a live-action ""Little Mermaid,"" ""Indiana Jones 5"" with Harrison Ford. So a lot to look forward to in 2023, and of course, at the end of 2022 with the ""Avatar"" sequel coming out. That is a Disney-owned property with 20th Century Studios. So theaters certainly happy with Disney through the end of this year and into 2023.SEANA SMITH: We'll see if it gets people back.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Mm-hm.DAVE BRIGGS: I love Paul Rudd. He's just a legend.SEANA SMITH: Me too, actually. I'll give you that.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Sexiest Man Alive.SEANA SMITH: I thought I was going to disagree with what was about to come out of your mouth, but I--DAVE BRIGGS: If you don't love Paul Rudd, there's something wrong with you. Allie Canal--SEANA SMITH: Agreed.DAVE BRIGGS: --thank you. Enjoy the weekend.]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.12% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.05%.Heading into today, shares of the cable provider had gained 19.42% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 7.44% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.93% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Comcast as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Comcast to post earnings of $0.79 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 2.6%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $30.69 billion, up 1.17% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.60 per share and revenue of $121.39 billion. These totals would mark changes of +11.46% and +4.3%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Comcast should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.63% lower. Comcast is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Digging into valuation, Comcast currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.08. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.12, which means Comcast is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesWe can also see that CMCSA currently has a PEG ratio of 0.78. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Cable Television was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.78 at yesterday's closing price.The Cable Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 207, putting it in the bottom 18% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Despite a choppy market, attributable to Fed’s hawkish move, concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a stronger dollar, the insurance industry has been gathering steam banking on solid fundamentals.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry has gained 0.9% year to date. Players like MetLife Inc. MET, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG, MGIC Investment Corporation MTG and Radian Group Inc. (RDN), who have an impressive dividend history, continue to offer a stable income.By virtue of the nature of their business, multiline insurers stand to benefit from a diversified portfolio, which, in turn, lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Also, an increase in the exposure of intangibles and an increase in cyber threats offers room for growth for non-life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about six-fold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report.The Fed’s strategic move to hike interest rates to curb inflation has been benefiting the insurance industry as insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. The Fed has already raised rates six times this year. Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, the higher the rates, the better the investment results. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level aids insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Story continuesDividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity. Regular dividend hikes reflect confidence in operational strength, which, in turn, fuel earnings power.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected five multiline insurers that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), a dividend yield of more than 2% as well as a five-year historical dividend growth rate of more than 2%. These stocks have a payout ratio of less than 60, reflecting enough room for future dividend increases. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Radian Group, with a market capitalization of $3 billion, is a credit enhancement company, which supports homebuyers, mortgage lenders, loan servicers and investors with a suite of private mortgage insurance and related risk-management products and services.RDN witnessed five-year annualized dividend growth of 248.4%. Riding on continued financial strength and flexibility, Radian declared a 43% increase in quarterly dividends in the first quarter of 2022, which translated into the highest dividend yield in the private MI industry. Its current dividend yield of 4.1% betters the industry average of 2.5%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 16. (Check Radian Group’s dividend history here)Radian Group Inc.

QuoteRadian’s mortgage insurance portfolio is expected to create a strong foundation for future earnings. RDN remains focused on improving its mortgage insurance portfolio, the main catalyst of long-term earnings growth. For 2022, Radian estimates total mortgage originations to be nearly $3 trillion, reflecting an 8% increase in purchase originations and a 58% decrease in refinance activity. Also, given the strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured, we expect the company to see fewer claims than before. Radian Group maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows. A strong capital position helps this Zacks Rank #2 insurer deploy capital via share repurchases and dividend hikes that enhance shareholders’ value.MGIC Investment, with a market capitalization of $4.1 billion, engages in the insurance underwriting and related services business primarily in the United States and Canada.MTG has an impressive dividend history, banking on a solid capital position. The largest private mortgage insurer in the United States increased dividends three times in the last five years. Its dividend yield of 2.9% betters the industry average of 2.5%.

PRU remains focused on investing in businesses to expand its addressable market and to continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. Prudential envisions about a 65% free cash flow ratio of earnings and about two times its dividend.The Hartford Financial, with a market capitalization of $24.1 billion, is one of the major multi-line insurance and investment companies in the country, providing investment products, group life and group disability insurance, property and casualty insurance and mutual funds in the United States.HIG increased its dividend at a five-year CAGR of 8.7%.

If you want to read about some more affordable energy stocks, go directly to 5 Best Affordable Energy Stocks to Buy Now.The energy sector comprises a variety of industries that include heavy hitters like renewable energy, electric power, nuclear power, and coal, in addition to oil and gas. These sub-sectors have started to slowly eat away at the dominance of the latter duo in the energy space, in part due to new ESG initiatives adopted by many businesses in the wake of global concerns around climate change. The energy services sector, comprising the sale of technology, energy, analytics, access to the grid, and personalized services, has also grown. The global energy demand has been rising slowly, increasing at an average rate of around 2% in the past four decades. The Chinese dominate the numbers in terms of new demand, with other big economies like the United States, India, and Russia following close behind. According to a recent report by Fortune Business Insight, the global energy as a service market is expected to grow from $70.46 billion in 2022 to $147.56 billion by 2029, at an impressive compound annual growth rate of 11.1%. The energy services market was severely impacted by the pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine in the past two years. Even as demand rises, there has been a marked decline in commercial and industrial activities in the energy sector. As per the report by Economist Intelligence, energy consumption demand grew by a very small number in 2022 due to high prices and a contraction in gas and oil supplies from Russia. For the remainder of 2022, oil prices are likely to remain above US$100/b as long as conflict rages in Ukraine. Meanwhile, gas prices will rise by at least 50% this year, per the report. This is due to disruption of supply chains which will come from three sources: difficulties affecting land-based routes; restrictions on air links; and the cancellation of sea freight routes from Ukraine. The EIU estimates that global energy consumption will grow at a healthier pace in 2023 due to these factors. Some top firms working in the sector include Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Story continuesEIU also notes that a shift towards renewable energy sources is a major theme in the industry that new investors must be wary of.  According to Bloomberg, from 2010 to 2019, the renewable energy resources collectively drew around $2.9 trillion in investments. Solar energy accounts for 8% of the global energy generation and wind energy accounts for 9%, as of 2022. Governments are likely to invest more in the renewable energy production sectors due to recession fears, geopolitical tensions, and fears of regional conflicts affecting supplies. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the energy sector and were trading at below $50 per share, as of December 1, were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices.

A stock buyback occurs when a company elects to purchase outstanding shares of its stock, essentially re-investing in itself.There are several reasons buybacks can occur - companies have decided to utilize excess cash, want to limit dilution caused by employee stock option programs, or simply because they believe their shares are undervalued.Three companies have recently announced new stock buyback programs, including Visa V, Walmart WMT, and United Rentals, Inc. URI.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.WalmartWalmart’s product offerings include almost everything from grocery to cosmetics, electronics to stationery, home furnishings to health and wellness products, and apparel to entertainment products, to name a few.The company has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn its latest earnings release (Q3), WMT approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing its existing authorization that had approximately $1.9 billion remaining at the end of the quarter.The company has managed to string together better-than-expected results in a harsh backdrop, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in back-to-back quarters.In its Q3, WMT delivered a 13% bottom-line beat paired with a 3.7% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisaA multinational financial services company, Visa facilitates electronic funds transfers through Visa-branded debit, credit, and prepaid cards.In Visa’s latest earnings release (Q4), the company authorized a new $12 billion share repurchase program and raised its quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.45 per share.Story continuesThe company’s annual dividend currently yields 0.8%, just a tick below its Zacks Business Services sector average. Still, the company’s 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate is undoubtedly strong.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s hard to ignore V’s free cash flow strength; in its Q4, the company reported free cash flow of $5.6 billion, reflecting a nearly 50% Y/Y uptick.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited RentalsUnited Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of rental locations in the United States, Canada, and Europe.Like WMT, United Rentals has seen its near-term earnings outlook turn positive over the last several months, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Rentals unveiled a new $1.25 billion share repurchase program in its latest earnings release (Q3), following the company’s prior $1 billion share buyback that was completed.Further, URI doesn’t carry stretched valuation multiples; the company’s shares currently trade at a 10.9X forward earnings multiple, a few ticks above its 10.6X five-year median and below its Zacks Construction sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI sports a Style Score of “A” for Value.Bottom LineA common way that companies can boost shareholder value is through share buybacks. In its simplest form, the company is essentially re-investing in itself.In addition, it can provide a nice confidence boost for investors, with the buybacks indicating that the company is utilizing its excess cash and not just hoarding it.And in the face of a challenging economic backdrop in 2022, companies willing to dish out extra cash can be hard to find.All three stocks above – Visa V, Walmart WMT, and United Rentals, Inc. URI – have all unveiled new repurchase programs as of late in an attempt to maximize shareholder value.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This means that a larger number of shares were purchased by insiders in relation to shares sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Oracle Oracle Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Director Charles Moorman bought US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$84.57 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$83.35. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Charles Moorman was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeOracle is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of OracleI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Oracle insiders own about US$96b worth of shares (which is 43% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Oracle Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Oracle insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. When we did our research, we found 4 warning signs for Oracle (2 make us uncomfortable!) that we believe deserve your full attention.But note: Oracle may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

261,8c2845e1-e0f6-31f7-b776-d9be4a816c9a,FIS,2022-12-03,"We Wouldn't Be Too Quick To Buy Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wouldnt-too-quick-buy-fidelity-121115193.html,1670069475,STORY,['FIS'],"[It looks like Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, Fidelity National Information Services investors that purchase the stock on or after the 8th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.47 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.88 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Fidelity National Information Services has a trailing yield of 2.5% on the current stock price of $74.06. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Fidelity National Information Services has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fidelity National Information Services distributed an unsustainably high 117% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without extenuating circumstances, we'd consider the dividend at risk of a cut. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 45% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.Story continuesIt's good to see that while Fidelity National Information Services's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That explains why we're not overly excited about Fidelity National Information Services's flat earnings over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Fidelity National Information Services has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.9% a year on average.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Fidelity National Information Services for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have been effectively flat, which is a bit of a concern given the company is paying out 117% of its profit as dividends, which we feel is uncomfortably high. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Fidelity National Information Services. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Fidelity National Information Services and you should be aware of this before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to read about some more best coffee stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Coffee Stocks to Buy Now.Coffee is one of the favorite beverages in the world and a major source of caffeine for many, from students to retirees. According to a report by Business Insider, coffee is the second most sought-after commodity in the entire world, with an industry worth over $100 billion across the globe. In terms of exporting alone, the industry is valued at $20 billion and continues to be on the rise — on average, 500 billion cups of coffee are consumed yearly. In the last 50 years, the compounded average yearly growth rate of the coffee industry was 1.9%. In the last two decades, it rose to 2.2%. This increment means that the market size increased by 190%. Latest estimates suggest that 3 billion cups of coffee are consumed each day. Globally, it generates an annual income of $200 billion. In 2019, the world coffee demand was estimated between 164.8 million bags (ICO) and 166.5 million bags. In May 2022, the stock market’s downturn led to a drop in real wages in the industry and started to affect a range of goods and services. However, the price of coffee remains relatively high. Despite the downturn, consumption has continued to grow. According to a report by the National Coffee Association, in March 2022, coffee consumption among Americans was at a two-decade high. It shows the largest growth of about 14% increase since January 2021. Soft commodities consultant Judith Ganes, president of J Ganes Consulting, recently said a stock market downturn would not hurt overall coffee consumption. The expert believes that coffee will remain an affordable beverage and people don’t want to give it up. In an interview in October 2022, Vanusia Nogueira, an executive director at the International Coffee Organization, said that consumers will choose drinking coffee at home over cafes and restaurants due to rising inflation and risks of recession in coming months. Similarly, other market experts predict that as inflation rises and the prices of goods increase, people may socialize more over coffee as they may skip having lunch or dinner out with friends, and grab a coffee instead. Story continuesCoffee stores around the world have been rebounding from pandemic lows in recent months. According to a report by World Coffee Portal, the number of coffee stores in the United States has increased beyond levels seen in 2020. The report underlines that there are 38,411 branded coffee shops in the US, up 2.8% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Some of the top brands in the industry include Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Image by Free-Photos from PixabayOur MethodologyThe companies that operate in the coffee and beverages sector were selected for the list.

If you want to see more good stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.A good stock to buy is a stock of a strong company that can grow earnings in the future.Although a good stock to buy might decline in the near term, there would be a good chance that the good stock to buy would be higher in the long term given the company's normalized earnings potential and its competitive advantages. Ideally a good stock to buy would trade for a fair or attractive valuation.Many good stocks to buy have historically been leading blue chips that have increased their earnings per share over time. Many of the same stocks make it to the Dividend Aristocrats list where the company has increased its annual dividend for 25 years or more. Many good stocks to buy also return capital back to shareholders through share repurchases. Good stocks to buy are generally less volatile than the general market although there can be exceptions.Given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates significantly this year, the broader market has declined substantially with the S&amp;P 500 down 15% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6% year to date. Many stocks, including good stocks to buy, have also declined substantially as well. As a result, some blue chips with competitive advantages trade for fairly attractive valuations if the economy can grow as expected.Recently, stocks have increased due to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments that the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates at a slower pace.Nevertheless, Powell also said the central bank will still raise rates until it defeats inflation. He added, ""Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.""If economic data fails to meet expectations, the good stocks to buy could decline even further. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesTrump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now, we picked 15 companies with the right mix of scale, competitive advantages, and earnings growth potential.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stocks at the end of Q3 2022.15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now15.

Although the company's earnings might not meet expectations next year if there is a recession, analysts believe JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) will grow its EPS in the long term given its growing market share and its earnings power.Vltava Fund commented on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.Click to continue reading and see 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.Suggested articles:Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksObama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year ReturnsAQR Capital’s Performance, AUM and Top Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks.Raymond Thomas Dalio is an American billionaire investor and hedge fund manager, who has served as co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates since 1985. A global macro investor for more than 50 years, Dalio ran his hedge fund for most of its 47 years, building it into the largest hedge fund in the world and the fifth most important private company in the US according to Fortune Magazine. Recently, however, Dalio stepped down from running Bridgewater Associates and announced to remain on the fund’s board and public research team.Responsible for a number of investment innovations, including risk parity and alpha overlay, Dalio believes in taking profits on expensive stocks and then reinvesting. He calls this practice ""rotating the portfolio.""  As of this November, the billionaire’s real-time net worth amounts to $19.1 billion, according to Forbes. Over the decades he has become a valued macroeconomic advisor to many policymakers around the world and was even named one of the “100 Most Influential People in the World” by TIME magazine.One can also measure Dalio's investment expertise by the fact that the flagship Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater Associates returned 32% during the first half of the year due to increased economic volatility, while the broader markets have been left struggling in the wake of global macroeconomic concerns. Some of the premier holdings of the Bridgewater portfolio include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock PicksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur Methodology We scanned Bridgewater's Q3 portfolio and picked top 10 stocks that the fund has been holding over the past several quarters.Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $293.7 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.48%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns CVS Pharmacy, a retail pharmacy chain; CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager; and Aetna, a health insurance provider, among many other brands. The company has been a part of Bridgewater Associates’ portfolio since the third quarter of 2012 when the hedge fund opened its position with shares worth $2.7 million. It represents 1.48% of billionaire Ray Dalio’s Q3 portfolio.Story continuesOn November 21, Credit Suisse analyst A.J. Rice raised the price target on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) to $125 from $117 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares post the company's Healthcare Conference and Q3 inputs.Of the 920 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 67 hedge funds owned stakes in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.14 billion.In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is one of the stocks backed by billionaire Ray Dalio in Q3 2022.Vltava Fund commented on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in a Q3 2022 investor letter, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”9. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $298 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company that operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The company has been a part of Ray Dalio's portfolio since the third quarter of 2020. As of the third quarter of 2022, Bridgewater Associates increased its position in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) by 11%. Ray Dalio's hedge fund owns over 3 million shares in the company, with a total value of over $298 million.Barclays analyst Matt Miksic lowered the price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $114 from $118 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the market reaction to the company's Q3 results returned Abbott shares to early October levels. However, he finds Abbott's performance in Diabetes, EPD and Cardio Devices to be ""encouraging.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”8. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $317.06 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.6%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is a Shanghai, China-based social e-commerce platform with a user base of 900 million globally. The company leverages technology to promote and enable the traditional agriculture industry. As of 2022, 16 million farmers have connected with the platform in China.  At the close of Q3 2022, he reported holding $317.06 million worth of PDD shares. The billionaire added the company to his portfolio back in Q2 2019.Morgan Stanley analyst Eddy Wang raised the price target on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) to $77 from $65 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares after the company's Q3 results beat his estimates on both the top and bottom lines on November 29. Wang expects Pinduoduo's revenue growth momentum to carry well into Q4 based off an easier base, citing greater promotional activity during this year's Double 11.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 54 hedge funds were long Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), compared to 41 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.20 million shares valued at $326 million.Here’s what Tao Value said about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue grow with such a team with strong culture.”7. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $487.73 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 2.46%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald.

According to the analyst, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is placed in an enviable position, where its U.S. business is less reliant on unit growth or remodeling in the face of rising interest rates, and should continue to benefit from a largely rational promotional environment in the wake of the European and FX headwinds.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was a part of 53 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 50 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey’s data.

(NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, McDonald's' earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's peKeen to find out how analysts think McDonald's' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like McDonald's' to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 18%. This has erased any of its gains during the last three years, with practically no change in EPS being achieved in total. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 15% per year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.0% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that McDonald's' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From McDonald's' P/E?It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that McDonald's maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for McDonald's   you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of McDonald's' business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

This also highlights how businesses prioritize data investment over energy expenses, employee well-being and training.The rising data expenses also reduce the funds allocated to innovative projects. The survey concluded that UK-based organizations are allocating about one-third of their IT budgets to data storage and management.Seagate Technology Holdings PLC Price and ConsensusSeagate Technology Holdings PLC Price and ConsensusSeagate Technology Holdings PLC price-consensus-chart | Seagate Technology Holdings PLC QuoteThis represents an opportunity for the company to deploy its Lyve Cloud storage-as-a-service, which offers its users a cost-efficient way to manage and store their data.In October, the company unveiled the Lyve Cloud Analytics platform to help business organizations manage exponential unstructured data growth across multi-cloud environments and eliminates costs such as egress and API fees and vendor lock-ins.Lyve Cloud decreases the complexity and cost of storage infrastructure, hindering businesses from utilizing their data fully. Organizations may break down data silos, gain insights from their data, and significantly lower their total cost of ownership by utilizing Lyve Cloud in scenarios like data analytics, data repository for content collaboration and backup/disaster recovery.Lyve Cloud enables organizations to handle and move large amounts of data quickly and securely. This results in considerable cost savings and speeds up digital transformation and innovation.The current expansion may provide a steady revenue stream for the company in the long term, owing to ongoing digitalization and rising data costs. Per a report from Future Market Insights, the multi-cloud storage market is estimated to grow $23.7 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach $111.3 billion by 2032, registering a CAGR of 16.7% from 2022 to 2032. However, complex data access problems and high costs limit effective data use.Story continuesIn May, the company announced its expansion strategy for its Lyve Cloud, including three new Lyve Cloud regions in the United States (Dallas, Oklahoma City and Washington DC) as well as the new regions in Germany, India, Japan and the UK.These new regions will be complementary to the company’s Singapore Lyve region and the existing regions in the United States, taking the total to 10 regions with 16 availability zones.However, the company continues to suffer from global macroeconomic weakness, significant inventory adjustments by customers and weakness in consumer spending. Also, leveraged balance sheets and stiff competition are further concerns.Seagate currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.Recent times have been advantageous for United Parcel Service as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on United Parcel Service will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, United Parcel Service would need to produce growth that's similar to the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 73% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 124% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 1.1% per annum over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.1% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.With this information, we find it interesting that United Parcel Service is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are less bearish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.Story continuesThe Final WordGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Our examination of United Parcel Service's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support a more positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Having said that, be aware United Parcel Service is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is concerning.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than United Parcel Service.

For example, in May 2021, Bitcoin plummeted 50% before rebounding to all-time highs of approximately $69,000 later that year. Bitcoin is forecasted to conclude 2022 at nearly $16,800, down from $19,500 at the peak of the FTX crisis. If more controversy unfolds from FTX’s bankruptcy, Bitcoin can fall even further. Even ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood, who is a popular Bitcoin connoisseur, admitted that financial institutions may reevaluate their crypto strategies in the short-term because of FTX.Despite the volatile and unpredictable nature of the crypto industry, it still manages to contort some major financial rules, which is slowly but surely leading the world to a modern economy. Although the recent global events, FTX collapse, and Bitcoin plunge have impacted the crypto industry, there are retail traders around the world who believe that buying crypto products on the dip will result in a sector recovery. For example, Brazilian investors are indicating a solid proclivity for crypto even as the global industry is crashing down, with an unpredictable future ahead. Brazilians are trusting crypto assets over conventional financial investment products like equities and precious metals. Data from a November survey by Finbold indicates that 33% of Brazilian investors intend to purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin within the next 12 months. Cryptocurrency ranks as the top investment, followed by real estate at 26%, and stocks took up the third place at 22%.Some of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy include Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:CME) operates the world’s largest and most diversified derivatives marketplace. Shares fell 13% during the quarter (despite reporting strong average daily trading volume growth of 26% year-over year) due to concerns that EPS growth will slow in 2023 as the rate hike cycle comes to an end. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats, its product breadth and liquidity depth, its durable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures, and tailwinds from the rising rate environment.”9. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational firm that specializes in payment card services. In June 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) disclosed that Abra Crypto Card on the American Express network will transact in U.S. dollars and offer crypto back on any purchase category. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best crypto stocks to buy according to smart investors. Based on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)’s performance to date, the management continues to expect full-year revenue growth of 23% to 25% versus a 25.24% consensus and now stands by its initial full-year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65, compared to a $9.84 consensus.On November 29, Redburn analyst Fahed Kunwar initiated coverage of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) with a Neutral rating. The brand power of debit is declining as digital wallets become popular, contended the analyst, who believes the market underestimates the cyclical and structural concerns pressuring card network stocks.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 68 hedge funds were bullish on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 67 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 151.6 million shares worth $20.45 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.”8. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), a California-based computer technology and semiconductor company, is one of the best crypto stocks to monitor. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced in April 2022 its new Intel Blockscale ASIC, offering energy efficient hashing for proof-of-work consensus networks. Intel Blockscale ASIC will provide the energy efficiency and computing power needed to deliver scalable and sustainable operations. On November 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh resumed coverage of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) with a Neutral rating and a $32 price target. Since his earlier research note on February 18, the analyst thinks Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has seen higher challenges in both the server and PC markets, with server CPU ramps delayed to 2023 and weaker PC demand. While Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is regaining some share in PCs, in the core high margin server/data center segment it continues to expect market share loss into 2023, the analyst told investors.According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 69 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 funds in the last quarter worth $2.5 billion. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 15.15 million shares valued at $390.5 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”7. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a multinational financial technology company that serves the financial services, mobile payments, and point of sale industries. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s Cash App makes it convenient to invest in stocks and Bitcoin. In Q3 2022, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s gross profit outperformed Street estimates on the strength of its Cash App and Seller systems, but was partly offset by weaker Buy Now Pay Later gross profit. On November 16, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev raised the price target on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) to $69 from $57 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst said payday lending is largely significant to Cash App gross profit growth. Payday lending is a short-term boost to inflows, but it may eventually pressure Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s multiple as delinquencies across consumer lending continue to increase, the analyst wrote in a research note. This is concerning given Cash App's skew towards lower-income households, added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) at the end of September, compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), with a position worth $505.45 million. It is one of the best crypto stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund include Wells Fargo.”6. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a digital payments company that offers financial technology solutions under the PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, Zettle, Hyperwallet, Honey, and Paidy brands. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced in August 2022 that users can transfer crypto from PayPal to external crypto addresses for no network charges. In the PYMNTS survey -- Black Friday 2022: High Prices Reshape Holiday Shopping Habits, November 2022, Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri noted that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), an Outperform rated stock, remained a dominant e-commerce payment option.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 126 hedge funds were bullish on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 17.6 million shares worth $1.5 billion.In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the favorite crypto stocks among smart investors. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in e-commerce driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins.

It can also establish links with API-enabled customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.American Express’ platform aims to aid third-party issuing and acquiring participants in its network as they cater to their business clients. Network participants are relieved from the previously incurred costs related to the digital onboarding of buyers and suppliers.Further, the participants can extend lending solutions that enables them to avail working capital by buyers and suppliers. The platform also offers network participants access to a greater number of commercial clients across American Express' network.The Amex Business Link also promises to benefit buyers and suppliers, irrespective of their scale of business. Seamless buying and selling coupled with easy management of domestic and cross-border payments are some of the benefits of the newly launched platform. Moreover, it also empowers buyers and suppliers to accept payments made through diversified modes such as card, wire and check.The new platform is indicative of American Express’ continuous efforts to bring about speedier B2B payments. It also marks yet another investment of AXP as part of its customer acquisition, engagement and retention initiatives. An extremely useful platform like the Amex Business Link might intrigue customers to avail the solution and thereby, bolster AXP’s customer base. In an evolving digital era wherein businesses are compelled to infuse digitization into their operations, the decision to roll out Amex Business Link is aptly timed.  American Express is not content with simply launching digital payment solutions. Simultaneously, the company also has effective fraud prevention services in place that have been developed with the help of partnerships and investments.

Shares have added about 10.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Martin Marietta due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Martin Marietta (MLM) Lags on Q3 Earnings, Lowers 2022 GuidanceMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. reported mixed results for third-quarter 2022. Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues surpassed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the metrics improved backed by double-digit pricing growth on relatively flat organic aggregates shipments.Pertaining to fourth quarter views, Ward Nye, chairman and CEO of MLM, stated, “Importantly, we expect a return to expanding margins in the fourth quarter as the compounding effect of multiple pricing actions throughout the year offsets continued inflationary pressure and a slowdown in single-family residential construction.”Nye added, “Near-term, we expect affordability driven headwinds in the single-family residential end market will be offset by a significant acceleration in public infrastructure investment and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects.”On Aug 9, the company entered into a contract to sell the Tehachapi, CA cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland for $350 million in cash. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.Inside the HeadlinesMartin Marietta reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $4.69 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.74 by 1.1% but increased 10.4% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $4.25 per share.Total quarterly revenues (including Product and Services and Freight revenues) came in at $1.81 billion, up 16.3% from the year-ago period’s levels. Products and services revenues of $1.68 billion, contributing 92.8% to total revenues, increased 14.9% year over year and topped the consensus mark of $1.67 billion by 0.6%. The upside was driven by pricing gains and value-enhancing acquisitions.Story continuesSegment DiscussionBuilding Materials (including aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete, asphalt, paving product lines and Freight) reported revenues of $1,736 million, which increased 17.4% year over year. The upside was driven by double-digit pricing growth across all product lines and contributions from acquisitions. Within the segment, product and services revenues amounted to $1,611.5 million, up 15.9% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Freight revenues of $124.5 million were up from $88.1 million in the year-ago period.Within the Building Materials’ product and services umbrella, Aggregates revenues rose 18.5% of $1,015.7 million from the year-ago quarter’s levels. Cement revenues rose 23.4% year over year to $163.2 million. Ready Mixed Concrete’s revenues decreased 29.1% year over year to $227.4 million. Revenues in Asphalt and Paving product lines increased 58.1% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $309.8 million.Aggregates shipments rose 5.6% year over year (down 0.1% organically) and pricing advanced 11.6% (up 11.9% organically). Acquisition benefits were offset by logistical constraints, cement shortages and inclement weather in certain key markets.Geographically, East Group shipments were flat year over year due to unfavorable weather and supply chain challenges. Pricing increased 11.5% (up 10.3% on a mix-adjusted basis). West Groups’ aggregate shipments surged 15.6% from a year ago, driven by contributions from acquired operations and strong Texas demand, partially offset by a historically wet August in North Texas. Organic pricing in the region grew 12.4% year over year (up 13.2% on a mix-adjusted basis).Cement shipments advanced 2.3% year over year. Pricing increased 21.4% year over year (up 20.6% on a mix-basis). The upside was driven by continued strong demand and multiple price increases.Within the Downstream business, ready mixed concrete shipments declined 37.6%, with pricing growth of 13.6% from the prior-year quarter. Organically, shipments were down 16.8% due to record rainfall in portions of Texas during August and the completion of certain large projects. Yet, pricing grew 20.3% due to the positive impact of multiple price increases implemented during the year.Asphalt shipments and pricing jumped 31.3% and 26.1%, respectively. On an organic basis, total asphalt shipments and pricing increased 4.3% and 22%, respectively.Magnesia Specialties reported product and services of $69 million and freight revenues of $6.7 million, down 4% year over year, due to lower demand from domestic steel industry customers for dolomitic lime products.Operating HighlightsAdjusted gross profit increased 8.4% year over year. Adjusted gross margin came in at 26.9%, which decreased from 28.9% posted a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA of $533.1 million increased 8.8% year over year.Liquidity and Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2022, Martin Marietta had cash and cash equivalents of $135.7 million compared with $258.4 million at the 2021-end. Also, it had nearly $1.20 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities at the third quarter end. Long-term debt (excluding current maturities) was $4,339.9 million, down from $5,100.8 million at the 2021-end.Net cash provided by operations was $560.7 million for the first nine months, down from $780.3 million in the year-ago period.2022 Guidance UpdatedMartin Marietta updated its guidance for the current year, considering the first nine months’ result, ongoing inflationary pressure and lower aggregates volume. The updated guidance excludes businesses classified as discontinued operations and the gain on divestiture from the second quarter of 2022.The company expects consolidated products and services revenues in the range of $5,740-$5,845 million (compared with $5,770-$5,910 million expected earlier), gross profit in the $1,445-$1,510 million band (earlier expected in the $1,500-$1,585 million range), selling, general and administrative expenses within $390-$400 million as well as adjusted EBITDA between $1,610 million and $1,675 million (versus $1, 670-$1,750 million expected earlier).Interest expenses are likely to be within the $165-170 million range (versus $160-165 million expected earlier) and the tax rate is projected in the range of 22-23% (versus 21-22% projected earlier). Net earnings are anticipated in the $740-$800 million range versus the earlier projection of $780-$870 million. Capital expenditures are anticipated in the $450-500 million range, lower than the earlier expectation of $525-550 million.Within the Building Materials business, total aggregate shipment growth is now expected in the range of 4-5% versus the prior projection of 5.5-8%. Organically, it is likely to be negative 1-00%, down from prior anticipation of 1-2.5%. Aggregates products and services revenues are expected in the $3,525-$3,575 million range compared with the $3,565-$3,640 million projected earlier. Total aggregate pricing per ton is expected to grow between 10% and 12%. Gross profit is likely to be in the $995-$1,035 million band.Cement, Ready Mixed Concrete and Asphalt and Paving, and Magnesia Specialties Businesses’ products and services revenues are narrowed to $610-$625 million, $1,710-$1,745 million and $285-290 million range, respectively, versus $610-$630 million, $1,705-$1,750 million and $285-295 million. Gross profit for these three businesses is likely to be in the band of $210-$220 million, $150-$160 million, and $90-$95 million, respectively.2023 Preliminary ViewThe company anticipates aggregates shipments to be effectively flat as it expects stronger demand from public infrastructure and heavy non-residential projects of scale, offset by single-family residential softening. It expects aggregates pricing growth in low-double-digit as the carryover effects from multiple actions taken this year are combined with additional price increases, beginning in January 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -10.62% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Martin Marietta has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Martin Marietta has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is planning to further strengthen its infrastructure and properly execute its business strategy, which will ultimately allow the company to meet customer demands.2023 GuidanceTaking into account the benefit of new rates and customer growth, ONE Gas currently expects 2023 net income to be in the range of $224 million to $238 million, with earnings per diluted share of $4.02 to $4.26.The 2023 expectation is a tad higher than the 2022 net income expectation in the range of $217-$226 million and earnings per share in the band of $4.00-$4.16.The midpoint of 2023 guidance is $231 million in net income and $4.14 earnings per diluted share.The midpoint of the guidance is lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023, which is pegged at $4.35 per share.ONE Gas’ 2023 capital investment, including asset removal costs, is expected to be around $675 million and capital investments for extensions to new customers are expected to be nearly $185 million, primarily due to continued growth opportunities in Texas and Oklahoma.Long-Term InvestmentONE Gas expects its capital expenditure for 2023-2027 time period to be $3.6 billion or in the range of $675 million to $775 million per year.

293,9eaf0ef0-133a-3d8b-af67-7479df24d79f,OXY,2022-12-03,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) Stock's Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Decent: Will The Market Correct The Share Price In The Future?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-nyse-oxy-110108681.html,1670065268,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has had a rough month with its share price down 4.1%. But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study Occidental Petroleum's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:45% = US$13b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.45 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 45% ROETo begin with, Occidental Petroleum has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 32% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Despite this, Occidental Petroleum's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capitalStory continuesAs a next step, we compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and discovered that the industry saw an average growth of 6.8% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Occidental Petroleum is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Occidental Petroleum Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Occidental Petroleum's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 3.1%, (meaning the company retains97% of profits) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see higher growth than it has reported.In addition, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 18% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 18%, over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Occidental Petroleum has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. In addition, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that the company's earnings are expected to continue to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, PetIQ is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that PETQ's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.PETQ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.45, while BSX has a forward P/E of 26.63. We also note that PETQ has a PEG ratio of 1.18. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

ULTA posted splendid third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line cruising past the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing year over year. The company witnessed growth in all major categories and in all its store and digital channels. Ulta Beauty also saw a higher market share in prestige beauty compared with the year-ago period.Considering the third-quarter performance and anticipations for the fourth quarter, management raised its fiscal 2022 outlook.Quarterly NumbersUlta Beauty posted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.34, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.09. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the adjusted EPS amounted to $3.94.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUlta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUlta Beauty Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ulta Beauty Inc. Quote Net sales of this beauty products retailer surged 17.2% year over year to $2,338.8 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,193 million. The uptick can be attributed to the positive impact of the ongoing resilience of the beauty division, higher retail pricing, gains from new brands and product innovation.Comparable sales jumped 14.6%, backed by a 10.7% improvement in transactions and a 3.5% increase in the average ticket. Transactions benefited from growth of in-store transactions, while average ticket benefited from a higher average selling price – partly negated by reduced units per transaction.The gross profit increased 22% to $962.8 million. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, came in at 41.2%, up from 39.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. The upside can mainly be attributed to the leverage of fixed costs, solid growth in other revenues and greater merchandise margin, partly offset by increased inventory shrink.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses rose 18.6% to $597.2 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses stood at 25.5%, up from 25.2% reported in the year-ago quarter, due to store payroll and benefits deleverage, as well as corporate overheads. These were somewhat countered by reduced marketing costs.The operating income came in at $361.9 million, up 27.3% year over year. The operating margin was 15.5%, up from 14.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.Story continuesOther UpdatesUlta Beauty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $250.6 million. Net merchandise inventories came in at $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Stockholders’ equity at the end of the quarter stood at $1,922.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $573.4 million in the 39 weeks ended Oct 29, 2022.The company repurchased 340,271 shares for $137.5 million in the third quarter. As of Oct 29, 2022, Ulta Beauty had shares worth $1.4 billion left under its buyback program announced in March 2022.For fiscal 2022, capital expenditures are expected in the band of $300-$350 million.During the reported quarter, the company introduced 18 new stores and relocated one. Ulta Beauty ended the quarter with 1,343 stores.For fiscal 2022, ULTA expects 47 net new stores and 33 store remodeling and relocation projects.GuidanceUlta Beauty now expects fiscal 2022 net sales in the range of $9.95-$10 billion compared with the $9.65-$9.75 billion range expected earlier. Comps are expected to rise in the range of 12.6-13.2% compared with the earlier view of 9.5-10.5%. The company projects 6-8% comp growth in the fourth quarter.For fiscal 2022, management now expects the operating margin to be between 15.5% and 15.6%, which was earlier expected between 14.6% and 14.8%. ULTA envisions gross margin expansion for fiscal 2022 fueled by fixed costs leverage and growth in other revenue. These factors will somewhat be offset by reduced merchandise margin, higher shrink and escalated supply chain costs.Ulta Beauty expects SG&amp;A expenses to rise 15-16% in fiscal 2022, mainly owing to expenses associated with the company’s strategic priorities and increased wage rate partially offset by reduced marketing costs. Management expects to keep seeing inflationary pressure on operating expenses.For fiscal 2022, earnings are envisioned in the range of $22.6-$22.9 per share now, up from the $20.7-$21.2 per share range expected before.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 9.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 10.6% growth.Retail Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Retail-Wholesale sector are Tecnoglass TGLS, Ross Stores Inc.

And there, you're taking a look at the actuals versus the estimates there. The revenue about $2.33 billion. The EPS, that came in at $5.34 versus that $4.15 that was expected here.But for Ulta Beauty and for the broader beauty landscape, we've continued to really try to get a sense of where this little luxury annexation might continue to be a tailwind for them. At least as consumers are looking across their own spending habits and patterns, and trying to just lean into the things that make us feel good. I mean, when I get my makeup for the show it makes me feel good.JULIE HYMAN: Does it make you feel good?BRAD SMITH: It makes me feel very good.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, you feel like you're ready for the day. You're ready to take on anything.BRAD SMITH: At least for two hours.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, at least for two hours. And if you look into some of the internals of this and of the forecast from the company, you see there the growth outlook here for the third quarter. Comparable sales up 14.6%. Pretty impressive there. And the company's forecast for the full year is for sales to rise by up to $10 billion. So that's an increase of the prior forecast there.Looking at some of the analysts' commentary on this one. Seeing that the company's loyalty program continues to grow. So that's something that is interesting here. 39 million, according to Piper Sandler, is how many loyalty members this company now has. And that Ulta continues to be a name to own in the beauty space. And that it can drive engagement.One other interesting commentary from Piper Sandler on this is it's not only proven itself to be one of the more resilient names in beauty, but also a name with strong momentum that's likely to persist. So in other words, you have beauty, which to your point, is a category that has been resilient here. And then you have this company within beauty that has been resilient. Perhaps because it is also not viewed as an expensive--Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Right.JULIE HYMAN: --on the-- in the range and the spectrum of beauty names.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: It's not super expensive.BRAD SMITH: Gross profit, that also jumped 22% in this quarter, too. That's compared to that $789 and 1/2 million that they saw in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. This quarter it was actually $962.8 million. So that really showing some of the strength within the beauty category.And then it's all about how they're operating right now, too. Operating income, you saw that increase by about 27.3%. So for the company, just showing to investors that they can continue to lock in margins over an extended period of time, even if consumers, at some point, do shift their spending or purchasing habits and are buying less or at least replenishing less of their own makeup. Then that is something that investors perhaps will favor. But here in a down day, we're seeing shares move lower here.]"

Three major consumer goods companies have taken strides in that direction, executives said at a Fortune conference on Tuesday.Nicole Cerroni, vice president of sustainability at L’Oréal USA, highlighted the cosmetics giant’s new product impact labelling system. L’Oréal will be asking people to interact with its offerings in new ways, whether that means refilling a bottle or using shampoo in a bar format, Cerroni explained at the Fortune Impact Initiative in Atlanta. To help them prepare, the system ranks products from A to E, based on 14 factors such as carbon emissions, ocean acidification, and biodiversity, she said. “It’s an approach to provide consumers with transparent and science-based information on the environmental impact of the products from L’Oreal.”Cerroni also cited a recent L’Oréal survey with Morning Consult. Although more than 80% of Americans polled said it’s important that companies practice such product transparency, less than half said they have the information they need to make sustainability-based purchasing decisions. For L’Oréal, the labeling system “is a really critical step in helping consumers understand what a more sustainable choice is, what a more circular product is, and really start to engage them and educate them so that eventually we can ask them to change their behavior when it comes to consumption,” Cerroni said.For its part, The Coca-Cola Company has set an industry-leading target for refillable and reusable packaging. “We have a goal to have 25% of our volume globally in reusable packaging by 2030,” said Michael Goltzman, vice president, global public policy, and sustainability at [hotlink]Coca-Cola[/hotlink].Besides reusable plastic and glass bottles, the effort includes drink dispensers, added Goltzman, who said [hotlink]Coca-Cola[/hotlink] is building on a strong foundation. “In more than 40 markets around the world today, we already have more than 25% of our portfolio in refillable packaging,” he noted. “So we’ve really built out the plans to get us there so that actually, if you take it at the global level, we’ll be there in 2030.”Story continuesWhen Target created its new sustainability strategy, Target Forward, the retail titan identified areas where it could create positive change, said Amanda Nusz, senior vice president of corporate responsibility at [hotlink]Target[/hotlink]. “As we talk about circular economy, one of the things you’ll hear from Target is that we are really looking at it from an environmental and a social lens together,” added Nusz, who is also president of the Target Foundation.Besides accelerating opportunity and equity, Target Forward’s three ambitions include designing and elevating sustainable brands and innovating to eliminate waste. “We really see the importance of a design mindset, a design focus to really think about how do you design, joyful, affordable, inclusive products that are zero-waste,” Nusz said.To that end, Target created its Circular Design Guide. “We’ve trained over 2,000 team members on what it means to really design from a circular lens,” Nusz said. Partnerships are another key piece of the strategy. For example, Target joined forces with investment firm Closed Loop Partners and fellow retailers for Beyond the Bag, which aims to reinvent the retail bag. After a competition to identify the most innovative ideas, Target and its peers agreed to pilot them in different markets. “The solutions are going to continue to evolve,” Nusz said. “Giving the pilots plenty of time to learn and to follow that through is really important.”Goltzman tied Coca-Cola’s packaging initiative to its World Without Waste strategy, whose three pillars are sustainable design, waste collection, and environmental partnerships. “Circular economy is important for us because it is the way to get to two goals that are part of our overall ESG strategy,” he said. “Creating the circular economy helps us address the challenge around eliminating waste and also around climate, around carbon emissions reduction.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  The American middle class is at the end of an era Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each other The 5 most common mistakes lottery winners make Sick with a new Omicron variant?

MHK has consistently demonstrated its ability to deliver sales growth and generate strong cash flow despite significant inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical instability. However, this quarter was an inflection point as the slowing U.S. housing market began to change consumer discretionary spend. Higher natural gas prices and constrained supply in Europe presented another headwind. Given these factors, MHK guided to softening demand and increasing pressure on margins moving forward. Management initiated corrective actions across the enterprise including implementing further price increases, enhancing service levels and restructuring to reduce costs. In our view, MHK’s track record of success managing through economic cycles and healthy balance sheet have the company wellpositioned to benefit from long-term growth in residential remodeling, new home construction and commercial projects.

Shares have added about 28.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sabre due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Sabre Posts Narrower-Than-Expected Q3 Loss, Sales Up Y/YSabre Corporation reported a loss for the third quarter of 2022 and lower-than-expected top-line results raising concerns for slow post-pandemic recovery.The company’s adjusted loss was 25 cents per share, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure was narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 50 cents per share.Sabre reported revenues of $663.4 million for the third quarter, 50% higher than $441.1 million in the year-ago period. This year-over-year surge in the top line reflects a significant improvement in global air, hotel and other bookings. However, the top line fell short of the consensus mark of $695.8 million.Quarter in DetailThe Travel Solutions segment’s revenues increased 55% year over year to $604 million, primarily on the gradual recovery in global air and other bookings, partially offset by reduced revenues due to the sale of the AirCentre portfolio in February 2022. The segment’s revenues also benefited from favorable rate impacts as international and corporate bookings improved.Distribution’s (a sub-division of Travel Solutions) revenues improved to $431 million from $245 million in the third quarter of 2021. This was chiefly driven by the gradual recovery in bookings and an increase in average booking fees due to a shift in the booking mix.IT Solutions’ (a sub-division of Travel Solutions) revenues were $173 million, up 19% from the year-ago quarter’s $145 million. This increase was primarily driven by the gradual recovery in passengers boarded. The number of boarded airline passengers — a key revenue metric for the IT Solutions division — increased to 179.9 million from 115.6 million in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesThe Hospitality Solutions segment’s revenues totaled $67 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s $55 million. This upside was mainly fueled by the increase in central reservation system transactions, which rose to 31.6 million from 26.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Sabre reported an adjusted operating income of $0.7 million, significantly improving from the operating loss of $102.6 million posted in the year-earlier period.Adjusted EBITDA improved from a negative $54.9 million reported a year ago to a positive $34.3 million. This improvement was driven by an increase in revenues.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowSabre exited the September-end quarter with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $804 million compared with the previous quarter’s $1.01 billion.In the third quarter, the company utilized $102 million in cash for operational activities and generated negative free cash flow of $123 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -15.31% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Sabre has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Sabre has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerSabre belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, VeriSign (VRSN), has gained 13.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.VeriSign reported revenues of $356.9 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.8%. EPS of $1.58 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.For the current quarter, VeriSign is expected to post earnings of $1.53 per share, indicating a change of +3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for VeriSign.

316,6ec2a9cf-6a37-3f44-9aff-71834898d5c4,WHR,2022-12-03,CONSOL Energy and Whirlpool have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consol-energy-whirlpool-highlighted-zacks-131401924.html,1669986841,STORY,"['CNX', 'WHR', 'CEIX', '^GSPC', 'AAPL']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 02, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares CONSOL Energy CEIX as the Bull of the Day and Whirlpool Corp. WHR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Apple AAPL, Tesla TSLA and Meta META.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The Zacks Coal Industry has been scorching hot in 2022, up more than a triple-digit 110% and crushing the S&amp;P 500's performance.Further, the Industry is currently ranked in the top 14% of all Zacks Industries (36 out of 250).Studies have shown that 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group it's in, making it crucial to ensure that investors target stocks in a thriving industry.In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.A company residing in the realm that's witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months isCONSOL Energy.CONSOL Energy is a publicly owned producer and exporter of high-BTU bituminous thermal coal and is one of the leading energy companies in the United States.Let's take a closer look at how the company currently stands.Share Performance &amp; ValuationYear-to-date, CEIX shares have been unbelievably strong, up more than 230% and leaving the S&amp;P 500's performance in the dust.Over the last month, CEIX shares have continued on their market-beating trajectory, up nearly 20%.Clearly, bulls have had complete control of this stock in 2022.Currently, shares trade at a 1.4X forward price-to-sales ratio, above the 0.6X five-year margin and its Zacks Coal Industry average of 0.8X.CEIX carries a Value Style Score of ""B.""Growth Outlook It's hard to ignore CEIX's growth profile, further bolstered by its Style Score of ""A"" for Growth.The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $11.05 for its current fiscal year (FY22) suggests a Y/Y improvement of more than 430%. And in FY23, estimates suggest a further 150% of bottom-line growth.Story continuesThe earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 57% in FY22 and 35% in FY23.DividendsLet's face it – we all love to get paid.Fortunately for those with an appetite for income, CEIX's 5.4% annual dividend yield provides precisely that.Bottom LineOne of the best ways investors can find expected winners is by utilizing the Zacks Rank – one of the most potent market tools out there that gives investors a massive advantage.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.CONSOL Energy would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:Bears have had a tight grip on the Zacks Household Appliances Industry in 2022, down more than 40% and widely lagging behind the S&amp;P 500.Further, the industry is currently ranked in the bottom 11% of all Zacks Industries (222 out of 250).A company residing in the realm that's seen its near-term earnings outlook come under pressure over the last several months is Whirlpool Corp..Whirlpool is one of the largest manufacturers of home appliances in the world. The company's portfolio of products can be broadly classified into laundry appliances, refrigerators and freezers, cooking appliances, and other small household appliances.Let's dive deeper into how the appliance titan stacks up currently.Share PerformanceWHR shares have been no exception to the general market's woes in 2022, down more than 30% and lagging behind the S&amp;P 500 notably.Still, over the last month, WHR shares have tacked on a strong 15% in value, indicating that buyers have finally stepped up.Growth OutlookWhirlpool carries a less-than-favorable growth profile, with earnings forecasted to decrease by 28% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 9.4% in FY23.The projected earnings slowdown comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue decreases of 9% in FY22 and 4% in FY23.Quarterly Performance In its latest release, Whirlpool fell short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 20%, snapping a long streak of positive surprises.Further, revenue results have consistently come in under expectations as of late, with the company falling short of sales estimates in five consecutive quarters. Below is a chart illustrating the company's revenue on a quarterly basis.Bottom LineA slowdown in growth and negative earnings estimate revisions from analysts paint a less-than-ideal picture for the company in the short term.Whirlpool Corp. is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), telling us it has a weak near-term earnings outlook.Investors should pivot to stocks that either carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks have a much stronger earnings outlook and potential to deliver explosive gains in the short-term.Additional content:Apple Up Nearly +5%: Should You Buy the Shares?Apple shares jumped 4.86% in the last trading session, part of the big rally that followed Fed Chair Powell's signal that interest rates were going to rise at a slower clip, probably starting this month, and probably resulting in the soft landing that we are all hoping for.Rates are at 3.75-4% right now, and now they could end up at 5% or higher. And then, they're going to hold there for as long as it takes to get inflation down. That's a bitter pill, but easier to swallow because it's old news.Of course, moderation is good for the stock market, which has also been absorbing the drop in job openings, which is seen as a signal that Fed actions are getting us somewhere. Inflation numbers will be out later today, so there's no doubt that there will be some reaction to that, as well.Inflation should hurt Apple, which sells this ultra-premium device, and some analysts have said that it could temper sales next year. You don't have to change your phone after all when you're seeing your savings melt away. Unless you have to.But it would be a mistake to read Apple quarter to quarter. The company has a fairly captive user base that has so much stuff on its cloud, music and other apps that it's really hard to switch even if you think that they're being a bully [Tesla, Meta and others are certainly asserting this last issue]. And its devices are pretty much the best available, so there just isn't much of an incentive to switch.Therefore, even if people don't buy or upgrade with Apple in the near term, they will likely eventually get around to it. The robust services business will continue to generate significant revenues and the cash hoard can always come in handy.What should have weighed on the shares, however, is the unrest within China because that's where its devices are put together. If its Chinese factories are not functional, and that's how things appear to be right now, Apple simply won't have enough product on the shelves. So Apple may give us a warning soon and estimates may have to be reset. Estimates have been coming down over the past quarter, and further downward revisions may be in the cards.Unfortunately, the Fed is not giving us the pullback that would make Apple shares worth buying. Despite the deteriorating earnings scenario, Apple shares trade at a 23.3X P/E multiple, a 28% premium to the S&amp;P 500 and a 7% premium to the technology sector. They are also trading at a 6% premium to their median level over the past five years. Therefore, the shares are not cheap.Zacks has a #3 (Hold) rating on the shares and it seems like a good idea to wait for a better entry point.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021. Amazingly, they soared +40.3%, +48.2%, +67.6%, +94.4%, and +95.3%.

318,45d619b9-5174-37f8-88c1-2afc64146823,IR,2022-12-03,"Instructure Holdings, Inc. (INST) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instructure-holdings-inc-inst-soars-141502917.html,1669990502,STORY,"['INST', 'TT']","[Shares of Instructure Holdings (INST) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 10.6% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $25.98 in the previous session. Instructure Holdings has gained 8% since the start of the year compared to the -25.4% move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the -46.9% return for the Zacks Technology Services industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 1, 2022, Instructure reported EPS of $0.29 versus consensus estimate of $0.25 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.88%.For the current fiscal year, Instructure is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share on $472.09 million in revenues. This represents a 14.74% change in EPS on a 16.46% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.20 per share on $521.56 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.46% and 10.48%, respectively.Valuation MetricsInstructure may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Instructure has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 23.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 22.1X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 15.1X versus its peer group's average of 12.2X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Instructure currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Instructure passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Instructure shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does INST Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of INST have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry?

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Generator Companies in the World. The importance of electricity in the modern day world cannot be understated. Life in the 21st century is built around electricity, and power generation infrastructures of all countries are considered a national security asset due to this integrality. Initially, electricity was used only to power public and business infrastructure, but as the light bulb popularized by Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan gained popularity, people could soon light up their homes as well.As the industry evolved, power generation switched from water or coal to other sources as well, particularly those involving hydrocarbons. Alongside, the invention of the generator took place during the same time line, and culminated in the modern day user being able to generate electricity at home simply by powering up a motor and feeding it fuel.Today, generators are powered by a variety of fuels, such as natural gas and diesel. The market is also worth billions of dollars, and, according to a research report from Fact.MR, will be worth $32 billion by the end of this year. From then until 2023, the industry will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% and sit at an estimated value of $55 by the end of the forecast period. Additionally, the research firm outlines that by 2022 end, China will be the largest generator market in the world, as it will command 22.6% of the market for a $7.3 billion share. North America and Europe will be the next two largest markets, commanding 19.9% and 16.2% shares, respectively.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has similar estimates for the market. It outlines that the global generator sales market was worth $26.7 billion last year and it will sit at $28.5 billion as 2022 ends. From there on until 2029, the industry will grow at a 5.8% growth rate and be worth $42.3 billion in 2029. Fortune Business Insights believes that the growth in the urbanization of rural areas will drive this trend, and on the industry side of things, the growth in construction and oil and gas exploration will spur the demand for generators. In terms of market subcategories, the research firm shares that generators capable of generating more than 750 kVA of electricity will be the fastest growers due to technological advancements enabling greater fuel efficiency and power generation.Story continuesToday's piece will list down the largest generator companies in the world, out of which the top players are Caterpillar Inc.

Per the agreement, Sempra will supply 1.4 million tons per annum (Mtpa) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Phase 1 of its Port Arthur LNG project for 20 years.A non-binding agreement has also been reached between the companies, wherein INEOS will purchase an additional 0.2 Mtpa from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project, which is currently under development.Both agreements indicate Sempra’s capabilities to meet the growing demand for natural gas and LNG globally. Such agreements with companies entail a steady inflow of revenues for the company.Growth ProspectsRussia exports of LNG to European countries decreased significantly due to the Russian-Ukraine war. This led to a sharp increase in LNG exports from the United States to European countries, leading to a substantial surge in demand. A recent report by the Energy Information Administration signifies that LNG export from the United States may rise from 9.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) to 10.8 bcf/d in 2022 and 12.3 bcf/d in 2023.The introduction of the latest technology in the LNG market, coupled with the evolving energy market, and the growing need for cleaner energy sources are fueling the demand for LNG.This signifies huge opportunities for Sempra, which has been looking forward to the LNG market for a handful of returns. Underpinned by huge expansion strategies in the LNG arena, Sempra is likely to benefit from rising demand in the LNG space. Apart from Phase 1 &amp; 2 of the Port Arthur LNG project, the company is developing Cameron LNG Phase 2, ECA LNG Phase 1 &amp; 2, Vista Pacifico LNG, and Hackberry CS.Such a strong portfolio of projects may enable the company to expand its footprint in the LNG space and boost its overall earnings.Peer MovesOther utilities that have invested in LNG business opportunities and are likely to benefit from the increased demand are:Story continuesClean Energy Fuels CLNE owns and operates two LNG production plants, one in California and another in Texas.

Shares have added about 8.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Vulcan due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Vulcan Materials Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat EstimatesVulcan Materials Company reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings and revenues beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.The nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates has been witnessing consistent growth in aggregates unit profitability, solid contributions from acquisitions, and a positive pricing environment, despite ongoing volatility in the macro environment and slowdown in single-family residential demand. However, higher diesel fuel costs and inflationary pressures for many other parts and supplies weighed on the bottom line.Looking ahead, chairman and CEO Tom Hill said, “As we look ahead to 2023, leading indicators suggest that growing public construction activity, particularly highways, and the recovery in private nonresidential contract awards should help to offset contracting single-family residential demand. The pricing environment remains positive, and we carry strong momentum into 2023.”Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings of $1.78 per share beat the consensus mark of $1.71. The company’s bottom line grew 15.6% from the year-ago level.Total revenues of $2,088.3 million surpassed the consensus mark of $1,999 million by 4.5% and increased 37.7% year over year. This upside was led by double-digit growth in the company's legacy operations as well as the addition of acquired businesses.Segments in DetailAggregates: Revenues from the segment increased 27.1% year over year to $1,490.5 million, owing to higher demand across all end-market segments. Aggregate shipments (volumes) increased 9% year over year (up 3% on a same-store basis). Strong demand across the company’s geographies (mainly strong in many southeastern markets and California) led to a positive pricing environment.For the quarter, freight-adjusted average sales price inched up 12% (12% on a mix-adjusted basis) from the prior-year level. Freight-adjusted revenues also rose 22.2% from the prior-year quarter to $1,097.2 million.Gross profit of $436.1 million was up 17.1% year over year, backed by price growth and solid operational execution, offsetting cost headwinds that include higher diesel fuel costs and inflationary pressures for many other parts and supplies.Story continuesAsphalt, Concrete and CalciumRevenues from the Asphalt segment were $310.2 million, up 40.6% year over year. The segment generated a gross profit of $29.5 million compared with $7.1 million a year ago. Volumes grew 13%, driven by growth in Arizona and California, the company's largest two asphalt markets. Asphalt pricing was up 26%. This was offset by higher pricing for liquid asphalt (high by 42%) and $3 million year-over-year increase in natural gas cost.Total revenues from the Concrete segment were $450.5 million, up 105.5% year over year. Further, gross profit totaled $26.5 million, up from $14.3 million a year ago. The upside was attributable to higher shipments and price growth in its legacy operations, as well as the contribution from USCR operations. Shipments grew 83.2% year over year, and average selling prices increased 12.7% from the prior-year level.Total revenues from the Calcium segment were up from the prior-year figure of $1.5 million to $2.1 million.

Revenue growth came on the back of 9.8% year-over-year growth in earned premiums within its Property-Liability business. Earned premiums were aided by better average premiums in auto and home insurance business coupled with higher Protection Services revenues.Q3 OperationsTotal costs and expenses of $14,128 million escalated 15.3% year over year in the third quarter and came above our estimate of $12,983.3 million. The increase was due to higher property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance claims and claims expenses, and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and interest expenses.Allstate incurred a pretax loss of $920 million against pretax income of $226 million in the prior-year quarter. Our estimate suggests a pretax loss of $918.1 million.Total policies in force came in at 185 million as of Sep 30, 2022, slipping 3.6% year over year.Net investment income dropped 9.7% year over year to $690 million, mainly due to a 23.3% decline in performance-based investment income.

The underlying combined ratio of 96.4% deteriorated 600 bps year over year.Protection Services' revenues amounted to $640 million, which grew 7.2% year over year in the quarter under review. Strength in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Dealer Services contributed to the sound segmental performance. Adjusted net income of $35 million dropped 10% year over year. The figure lagged the consensus mark of $38.2 million but outpaced our estimate of $27.4 million.Allstate Health and Benefits’ total premium and contract charges inched up 0.7% year over year to $463 million. Growth came on the back of a rise in group health and employer voluntary benefits. The reported figure fell short of the consensus mark of $468 million. Adjusted net income of $54 million soared 63.6% year over year in the quarter under review and missed our estimate of $66.4 million.Financial Update (as of Sep 30, 2022)Allstate exited the third quarter with a cash balance of $786 million, up 3% from the 2021-end level. Total assets of $97.7 billion slid 1.8% from the figure at the end of 2021.Long-term debt amounted to $7,967 million, marginally down from $7,976 million at 2021 end.

If you want to see more good stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.A good stock to buy is a stock of a strong company that can grow earnings in the future.Although a good stock to buy might decline in the near term, there would be a good chance that the good stock to buy would be higher in the long term given the company's normalized earnings potential and its competitive advantages. Ideally a good stock to buy would trade for a fair or attractive valuation.Many good stocks to buy have historically been leading blue chips that have increased their earnings per share over time. Many of the same stocks make it to the Dividend Aristocrats list where the company has increased its annual dividend for 25 years or more. Many good stocks to buy also return capital back to shareholders through share repurchases. Good stocks to buy are generally less volatile than the general market although there can be exceptions.Given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates significantly this year, the broader market has declined substantially with the S&amp;P 500 down 15% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6% year to date. Many stocks, including good stocks to buy, have also declined substantially as well. As a result, some blue chips with competitive advantages trade for fairly attractive valuations if the economy can grow as expected.Recently, stocks have increased due to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments that the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates at a slower pace.Nevertheless, Powell also said the central bank will still raise rates until it defeats inflation. He added, ""Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.""If economic data fails to meet expectations, the good stocks to buy could decline even further. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesTrump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now, we picked 15 companies with the right mix of scale, competitive advantages, and earnings growth potential.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stocks at the end of Q3 2022.15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now15.

Although the company's earnings might not meet expectations next year if there is a recession, analysts believe JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) will grow its EPS in the long term given its growing market share and its earnings power.Vltava Fund commented on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.Click to continue reading and see 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.Suggested articles:Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksObama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year ReturnsAQR Capital’s Performance, AUM and Top Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.U.S. stock markets are witnessing a solid rally since mid-October, which is likely to extend till the year-end. We have selected four Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to gain from the ongoing rally. These stocks are — Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH and Walmart Inc. WMT.Dow Suffers the LeastYear to date, the three large-cap-centric stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 5.4%, 14.5% and 26.6% respectively. On Dec 1, the Dow — popularly known as the blue-chip index of Wall Street — technically exited the bear territory after closing more than 20% higher over its recent low posted on Sep 30.The primary concern of the U.S. economy is soaring inflation which is currently at its 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has already hiked interest rate sharply by 3.75% year to date.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks, especially the technology  players. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks rather than growth stocks. Therefore, the index has suffered the least.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks. These stocks have solid potential for December and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Merck’s new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio will be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days.Caterpillar’s revenues and earnings grew year over year for six straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of the ongoing supply-chain snarls and cost pressures.We expect CAT’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow 11.6%, while revenues are predicted to rise 11.2%. The Construction Industries space is expected to benefit from rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. CAT’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.Caterpillar has an expected earnings growth rate of 27.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 2% over the last 30 days.Walmart has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience.

329,0364cfe2-5fab-3f9e-b4f2-09fbff0d5731,EL,2022-12-03,Estee Lauder (EL) Up 19.7% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estee-lauder-el-19-7-163104377.html,1669998664,STORY,['EL'],"[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Estee Lauder (EL). Shares have added about 19.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Estee Lauder due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.The Estee Lauder Companies Down Despite Q1 Earnings BeatThe Estee Lauder Companies reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and bottom lines declining year over year. However, both metrics came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.COVID-19 continued affecting the company’s operating environment throughout the quarter, which included curbs in China that weighed on travel retail in Hainan and retail traffic in mainland China. Results were affected by increased inflation and concerns surrounding the recession, which led certain retailers to tighten the inventory. Management expects the rest of fiscal 2023 to remain pressurized by temporary hurdles stemming from pandemic-led curbs in China, foreign currency headwinds, heightened inflation, supply-chain bottlenecks and the risk of sluggishness in certain markets globally. However, The Estee Lauder Companies remains optimistic about opportunities in the global prestige beauty space.Quarter in DetailThe company posted adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29. However, the bottom line slumped 28% (down 24% at cc) year over year. This includes an adverse currency impact of 4% on core international travel retail locations.Net sales of $3,930 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,917 million. However, the metric declined 11% (down 7% at cc) from $4,392 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Organic net sales fell 5% in the quarter. Management highlighted that the company battled challenges related to pandemic-led curbs in China, partly compensated by solid organic sales growth in certain markets in the Asia/Pacific and many emerging and developed markets in the West. Category-wise, fragrance and hair care witnessed double-digit organic net sales growth.The gross profit came in at $2,907 million, down 13% year over year. The gross margin contracted to 74% from 75.9% reported in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating income declined 26% at cc, mainly due to reduced net sales.Story continuesProduct-Based Segment ResultsSkin Care’s sales were down 14% year over year (down 11% at cc) to $2,104 million. Makeup revenues fell 10% year over year (down 6% at cc) to $1,052 million. In the Fragrance category, revenues remained flat year over year (up 5% at cc) at $607 million. Hair Care sales totaled $158 million, up 7% (up 11% at cc).Regional ResultsSales in the Americas tumbled 6% year over year (down 7% at cc) to $1,123 million. Revenues in the EMEA region decreased 10% (down 6% at cc) to $1,682 million. In the Asia-Pacific region, sales declined 15% (down 7% at cc) to $1,130 million.Other UpdatesThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,938 million, long-term debt of $5,107 million and total equity of $5,517 million. Net cash flow used for operating activities for the three months ended Sep 30, 2022 was $650 million. The company returned $0.33 billion in cash to shareholders through dividend payouts and share repurchases.In a separate press release, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 66 cents per share on Class A and Class B shares, reflecting a 10% hike from the previous rate. The dividend will be paid out on Dec 15, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Nov 30.GuidanceManagement’s guidance for fiscal 2023 assumes ongoing inventory tightening by certain retailers in Asia travel retail and the United States. It further expects greater productive distribution to retailers, offering new customer reach and entry into new countries. The Estee Lauder Companies anticipates mitigating inflationary pressure through pricing, saving and mix optimization. Further, the company assumes greater savings from the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program.For fiscal 2023, management projects net sales to increase in the band of 6-8% year over year, which includes an unfavorable currency impact of 6%. The view includes tougher inventory management in travel retail due to the reduced traffic stemming from pandemic-led curbs. The guidance includes an unfavorable impact of 1% from the termination of its license agreements for the Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Ermenegildo Zegna product lines, effective Jun 30, 2022. The view also reflects a 1% adverse impact associated with returns related to restructuring and other activities. Organic net sales growth is anticipated to be flat to increase 2% in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EPS are expected in the band of $5.25-$5.40, suggesting a 25-27% decline from the year-ago period. The bottom line is expected to decline 19-21% at cc.For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, management expects net sales to decline in the band of 17-19% year over year. The guidance includes the adverse impacts of the abovementioned inventory management, currency headwinds and the termination of certain license agreements. Organic net sales are anticipated to decrease in the range of 9-11% in the second quarter. The quarterly adjusted EPS is anticipated in the band of $1.19-$1.29, indicating a 57-60% decrease from the year-ago period. The adjusted EPS is likely to decline 50-54% at cc.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -53.04% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Estee Lauder has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Estee Lauder has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ADP) For Its Upcoming US$1.25 Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/read-considering-automatic-data-processing-121611582.html,1670069771,STORY,['ADP'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Automatic Data Processing investors that purchase the stock on or after the 8th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of January.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Automatic Data Processing stock has a trailing yield of around 1.9% on the current share price of $269.9. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Automatic Data Processing paid out more than half (57%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 54% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Automatic Data Processing's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Automatic Data Processing's earnings per share have been growing at 13% a year for the past five years. Automatic Data Processing is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Automatic Data Processing has delivered 12% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpIs Automatic Data Processing an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. That's why we're glad to see Automatic Data Processing's earnings per share growing, although as we saw, the company is paying out more than half of its earnings and cashflow - 57% and 54% respectively. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.In light of that, while Automatic Data Processing has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Automatic Data Processing and you should be aware of it before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Procter &amp; Gamble, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Procter &amp; Gamble?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Procter &amp; Gamble's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Procter &amp; Gamble. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.5% of shares outstanding. With 6.8% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$243m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 35% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Procter &amp; Gamble. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Procter &amp; Gamble better, we need to consider many other factors.

If you want to see more good stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.A good stock to buy is a stock of a strong company that can grow earnings in the future.Although a good stock to buy might decline in the near term, there would be a good chance that the good stock to buy would be higher in the long term given the company's normalized earnings potential and its competitive advantages. Ideally a good stock to buy would trade for a fair or attractive valuation.Many good stocks to buy have historically been leading blue chips that have increased their earnings per share over time. Many of the same stocks make it to the Dividend Aristocrats list where the company has increased its annual dividend for 25 years or more. Many good stocks to buy also return capital back to shareholders through share repurchases. Good stocks to buy are generally less volatile than the general market although there can be exceptions.Given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates significantly this year, the broader market has declined substantially with the S&amp;P 500 down 15% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6% year to date. Many stocks, including good stocks to buy, have also declined substantially as well. As a result, some blue chips with competitive advantages trade for fairly attractive valuations if the economy can grow as expected.Recently, stocks have increased due to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments that the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates at a slower pace.Nevertheless, Powell also said the central bank will still raise rates until it defeats inflation. He added, ""Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.""If economic data fails to meet expectations, the good stocks to buy could decline even further. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesTrump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now, we picked 15 companies with the right mix of scale, competitive advantages, and earnings growth potential.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stocks at the end of Q3 2022.15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now15.

Although the company's earnings might not meet expectations next year if there is a recession, analysts believe JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) will grow its EPS in the long term given its growing market share and its earnings power.Vltava Fund commented on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.Click to continue reading and see 5 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now.Suggested articles:Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksObama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year ReturnsAQR Capital’s Performance, AUM and Top Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 15 Good Stocks to Invest in Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks.Raymond Thomas Dalio is an American billionaire investor and hedge fund manager, who has served as co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates since 1985. A global macro investor for more than 50 years, Dalio ran his hedge fund for most of its 47 years, building it into the largest hedge fund in the world and the fifth most important private company in the US according to Fortune Magazine. Recently, however, Dalio stepped down from running Bridgewater Associates and announced to remain on the fund’s board and public research team.Responsible for a number of investment innovations, including risk parity and alpha overlay, Dalio believes in taking profits on expensive stocks and then reinvesting. He calls this practice ""rotating the portfolio.""  As of this November, the billionaire’s real-time net worth amounts to $19.1 billion, according to Forbes. Over the decades he has become a valued macroeconomic advisor to many policymakers around the world and was even named one of the “100 Most Influential People in the World” by TIME magazine.One can also measure Dalio's investment expertise by the fact that the flagship Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater Associates returned 32% during the first half of the year due to increased economic volatility, while the broader markets have been left struggling in the wake of global macroeconomic concerns. Some of the premier holdings of the Bridgewater portfolio include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock PicksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur Methodology We scanned Bridgewater's Q3 portfolio and picked top 10 stocks that the fund has been holding over the past several quarters.Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $293.7 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.48%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns CVS Pharmacy, a retail pharmacy chain; CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager; and Aetna, a health insurance provider, among many other brands. The company has been a part of Bridgewater Associates’ portfolio since the third quarter of 2012 when the hedge fund opened its position with shares worth $2.7 million. It represents 1.48% of billionaire Ray Dalio’s Q3 portfolio.Story continuesOn November 21, Credit Suisse analyst A.J. Rice raised the price target on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) to $125 from $117 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares post the company's Healthcare Conference and Q3 inputs.Of the 920 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 67 hedge funds owned stakes in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.14 billion.In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is one of the stocks backed by billionaire Ray Dalio in Q3 2022.Vltava Fund commented on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in a Q3 2022 investor letter, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”9. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $298 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company that operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The company has been a part of Ray Dalio's portfolio since the third quarter of 2020. As of the third quarter of 2022, Bridgewater Associates increased its position in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) by 11%. Ray Dalio's hedge fund owns over 3 million shares in the company, with a total value of over $298 million.Barclays analyst Matt Miksic lowered the price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $114 from $118 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the market reaction to the company's Q3 results returned Abbott shares to early October levels. However, he finds Abbott's performance in Diabetes, EPD and Cardio Devices to be ""encouraging.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”8. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $317.06 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.6%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is a Shanghai, China-based social e-commerce platform with a user base of 900 million globally. The company leverages technology to promote and enable the traditional agriculture industry. As of 2022, 16 million farmers have connected with the platform in China.  At the close of Q3 2022, he reported holding $317.06 million worth of PDD shares. The billionaire added the company to his portfolio back in Q2 2019.Morgan Stanley analyst Eddy Wang raised the price target on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) to $77 from $65 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares after the company's Q3 results beat his estimates on both the top and bottom lines on November 29. Wang expects Pinduoduo's revenue growth momentum to carry well into Q4 based off an easier base, citing greater promotional activity during this year's Double 11.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 54 hedge funds were long Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), compared to 41 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.20 million shares valued at $326 million.Here’s what Tao Value said about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue grow with such a team with strong culture.”7. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $487.73 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 2.46%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald.

The firm first opened its position in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) during the first quarter of 2011 with shares worth over $4.6 million.Earlier this October, RBC Capital analyst Christopher Carril raised the price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) to $295 from $275 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares of the company. According to the analyst, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is placed in an enviable position, where its U.S. business is less reliant on unit growth or remodeling in the face of rising interest rates, and should continue to benefit from a largely rational promotional environment in the wake of the European and FX headwinds.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was a part of 53 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 50 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey’s data. The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth over $1.8 billion collectively.6. Walmart Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other.

(NASDAQ:PFG) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 76% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/principal-financial-group-inc-nasdaq-162142980.html,1669998102,STORY,['PFG'],"[If you want to know who really controls Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 76% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Principal Financial Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Principal Financial Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Principal Financial Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Principal Financial Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Principal Financial Group is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Principal Financial GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Principal Financial Group, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$92m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 23% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Principal Financial Group  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning.Ultimately the future is most important.

343,eedb1da1-2bd4-3bfa-be0a-00aa12e8de9a,SHW,2022-12-03,Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sherwin-williams-nyse-shw-stock-130031326.html,1670072431,STORY,['SHW'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) share price is up 89% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 47% (ignoring dividends).Since the stock has added US$2.1b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Sherwin-Williams managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Sherwin-Williams' TSR for the last 5 years was 98%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 14% in the twelve months, Sherwin-Williams shareholders did even worse, losing 24% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 15%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Sherwin-Williams better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Sherwin-Williams .There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

YORW and Global Water Resources, Inc. GWRS.Industry: Water UtilityLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2023996/4-water-utility-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryWater utilities work day in and day out to ensure an uninterrupted supply of clean potable water and reliable sewer services to millions of customers in the United States, which are essential for healthy and hygienic living.The aging of pipelines is concerning, but water utilities continue with their upgrade and maintenance projects to minimize disruptions in operations. American Water Works Company, with its widespread operations, systematic capital expenditure, and organic and inorganic initiatives to further expand operations, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the water utility space. Other utilities worth retaining in one's portfolio are Essential Utilities, The York Water Co. and Global Water Resources, Inc..About the IndustryThe Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry includes companies providing drinking water and wastewater services to industrial, commercial, residential customer classes and numerous military bases across the country. Water utility operators own nearly 2.2 million miles of pipelines that are getting old. Utilities continuously replace old pipelines and add new ones to expand operations.Utility operators own storage tanks, treatment plants and desalination plants to supply uninterrupted potable water across customer classes. Despite the ample presence of water across the globe, less than 1% of the total water volume is fit for human use.  Given the scenario, the water utilities, apart from ensuring proper infrastructure to supply water, utilize technology to treat saline water and make it fit for consumption.3 Trends Pivotal for Shaping the Water Supply Industry's FutureAging Infrastructure Needs Huge Investments: The water and wastewater infrastructure is aging and gradually nearing the end of its effective service life. Per the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers (""ASCE""), water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. The ASCE has provided a D+grade to the overall U.S. water and wastewater infrastructure.Story continuesPer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA""), an estimated $744-billion investment is necessary to maintain, and expand the drinking water and wastewater service to meet demand over the next 20 years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $50 billion to EPA to strengthen the drinking water and wastewater systems of the United States. A major portion of the investment will be directed to upgrading water infrastructure serving disadvantaged communities.Efficient Use is Saving Precious Water: An interesting trend in the water industry is reducing per-capita water usage. The reasons for the drop are the use of water-efficient techniques, raising awareness among customers by the water utilities, the use of advanced water-efficient appliances and actions taken to fix pipeline leaks.Lower use per person allows water utilities to meet the need of an expanding customer base without increasing capacity to a great extent. In a way, efficient usage and a reduction in wastage allow water utilities to keep their service rates unchanged for a longer period for consumers and assist water utility operators in increasing their earnings by serving a larger population with the same water supply capacity.Fragmented Water Industry Needs Consolidation: Since the U.S. water utility industry is highly fragmented, upgrading aging assets to provide quality services is the need of the hour. Per ASCE, at present, 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers.Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. The highly fragmented industry creates operational challenges in meeting the requirement for replacement, and adding to the aging water and wastewater infrastructure.Large water utility companies continue to acquire small companies to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investment required to upgrade old and acquired assets. Water conservation and initiatives taken by large water operators in educating their consumers on efficient use and appliances to detect leakage should help to prevent wastage.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Utility Water Supply industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #139, which places it in the bottom 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks.Raymond Thomas Dalio is an American billionaire investor and hedge fund manager, who has served as co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates since 1985. A global macro investor for more than 50 years, Dalio ran his hedge fund for most of its 47 years, building it into the largest hedge fund in the world and the fifth most important private company in the US according to Fortune Magazine. Recently, however, Dalio stepped down from running Bridgewater Associates and announced to remain on the fund’s board and public research team.Responsible for a number of investment innovations, including risk parity and alpha overlay, Dalio believes in taking profits on expensive stocks and then reinvesting. He calls this practice ""rotating the portfolio.""  As of this November, the billionaire’s real-time net worth amounts to $19.1 billion, according to Forbes. Over the decades he has become a valued macroeconomic advisor to many policymakers around the world and was even named one of the “100 Most Influential People in the World” by TIME magazine.One can also measure Dalio's investment expertise by the fact that the flagship Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater Associates returned 32% during the first half of the year due to increased economic volatility, while the broader markets have been left struggling in the wake of global macroeconomic concerns. Some of the premier holdings of the Bridgewater portfolio include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock PicksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur Methodology We scanned Bridgewater's Q3 portfolio and picked top 10 stocks that the fund has been holding over the past several quarters.Billionaire Ray Dalio's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $293.7 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.48%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns CVS Pharmacy, a retail pharmacy chain; CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager; and Aetna, a health insurance provider, among many other brands. The company has been a part of Bridgewater Associates’ portfolio since the third quarter of 2012 when the hedge fund opened its position with shares worth $2.7 million. It represents 1.48% of billionaire Ray Dalio’s Q3 portfolio.Story continuesOn November 21, Credit Suisse analyst A.J. Rice raised the price target on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) to $125 from $117 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares post the company's Healthcare Conference and Q3 inputs.Of the 920 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 67 hedge funds owned stakes in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.14 billion.In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is one of the stocks backed by billionaire Ray Dalio in Q3 2022.Vltava Fund commented on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in a Q3 2022 investor letter, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”9. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $298 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company that operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The company has been a part of Ray Dalio's portfolio since the third quarter of 2020. As of the third quarter of 2022, Bridgewater Associates increased its position in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) by 11%. Ray Dalio's hedge fund owns over 3 million shares in the company, with a total value of over $298 million.Barclays analyst Matt Miksic lowered the price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $114 from $118 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the market reaction to the company's Q3 results returned Abbott shares to early October levels. However, he finds Abbott's performance in Diabetes, EPD and Cardio Devices to be ""encouraging.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”8. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $317.06 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 1.6%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is a Shanghai, China-based social e-commerce platform with a user base of 900 million globally. The company leverages technology to promote and enable the traditional agriculture industry. As of 2022, 16 million farmers have connected with the platform in China.  At the close of Q3 2022, he reported holding $317.06 million worth of PDD shares. The billionaire added the company to his portfolio back in Q2 2019.Morgan Stanley analyst Eddy Wang raised the price target on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) to $77 from $65 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares after the company's Q3 results beat his estimates on both the top and bottom lines on November 29. Wang expects Pinduoduo's revenue growth momentum to carry well into Q4 based off an easier base, citing greater promotional activity during this year's Double 11.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 54 hedge funds were long Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), compared to 41 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.20 million shares valued at $326 million.Here’s what Tao Value said about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue grow with such a team with strong culture.”7. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $487.73 millionPercentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 2.46%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald.

According to the analyst, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is placed in an enviable position, where its U.S. business is less reliant on unit growth or remodeling in the face of rising interest rates, and should continue to benefit from a largely rational promotional environment in the wake of the European and FX headwinds.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was a part of 53 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 50 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey’s data.

(NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's 5 Long-Term Stock Picks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

351,0e225806-d4b5-347b-9fe8-1cef676e4fbf,CSCO,2022-12-03,"Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-csco-trending-140002705.html,1669989602,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +14% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has gained 9.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.55 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.7%. This estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.81 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cisco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Cisco, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.42 billion and $56.33 billion estimates indicate +5.5% and +3.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $0.86 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.32%. The EPS surprise was +2.38%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
