0,c0cd846a-beb3-3d6a-b86d-140c87c700bc,SCHW,2023-01-03,Should Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF (FNDX) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-u-large-company-112011082.html,1672744811,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF (FNDX) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 08/13/2013.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $9.93 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.07%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 14.90% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.39% of total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).The top 10 holdings account for about 19.55% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskFNDX seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Large Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Large Company Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.The ETF has added roughly 0% so far this year and is down about -6.94% in the last one year (as of 01/03/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $47.76 and $59.90.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 25.40% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 729 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, FNDX is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $54.20 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $97.90 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

1,a3b0c97b-a986-3829-b330-a4c0cdb8c7ad,SCHW,2023-01-03,Is SWCAX a Strong Bond Fund Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swcax-strong-bond-fund-now-120012475.html,1672660812,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Mutual Fund Bond fund seekers should not consider taking a look at Schwab California Tax-Free Bond Fund (SWCAX) at this time. SWCAX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWCAX. The Schwab California Tax-Free Bond Fund made its debut in February of 1992 and SWCAX has managed to accumulate roughly $419.85 million in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 0.77%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of -1.21%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWCAX over the past three years is 5.32% compared to the category average of 5.39%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 4.35% compared to the category average of 4.44%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.This fund has a beta of 0.64, meaning that it is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, SWCAX has a negative alpha of -0.62, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.ExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWCAX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.38% compared to the category average of 0.79%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, SWCAX is actually cheaper than its peers.Story continuesInvestors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab California Tax-Free Bond Fund ( SWCAX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab California Tax-Free Bond Fund ( SWCAX ) looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.This could just be the start of your research on SWCAXin the Mutual Fund Bond category.

2,d0a18e95-5f83-34c4-8bdc-d8311e0a554e,AYI,2023-01-03,Acuity Brands (AYI) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/acuity-brands-ayi-expected-beat-150003624.html,1672671603,STORY,['AYI'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Acuity Brands (AYI) reports results for the quarter ended November 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis lighting maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1 billion, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.08% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Acuity Brands?For Acuity Brands, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.71%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Acuity Brands will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Acuity Brands would post earnings of $3.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.95, delivering a surprise of +17.91%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Acuity Brands appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PVH, Signet Jewelers SIG, Unum Group UNM, Aercap AER and Sterling Infrastructure STRL.5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Buy in the New YearValue investors have, over the years, preferred price-to-earnings ratio or P/E as a means to identify value stocks. However, in the case of loss-making companies that have a negative price-to-earnings ratio, the price-to-sales or P/S ratio is considered in determining their true value.However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. PVH Corp., Signet Jewelers, Unum Group, Aercap and Sterling Infrastructure are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:PVH Corp. specializes in designing and marketing branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, handbags and related products.PVH Corp. has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

Last year the company consolidated control of the Karl Lagerfeld brand, setting it alongside of Vilebrequin, acquired in 2012, and Sonia Rykiel, acquired in 2021, for a trio of European-based luxury houses. The company also owns the DKNY brand and other businesses.“We’re at the early stage of all our assets,” Goldfarb said. “There’s plenty of organic growth, there’s plenty of opportunities to supplement them.”]"

(NYSE:CF)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-cf-industries-holdings-122039283.html,1672748439,STORY,['CF'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$110 and falling to the lows of US$85.20. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether CF Industries Holdings' current trading price of US$85.20 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at CF Industries Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings What Is CF Industries Holdings Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy CF Industries Holdings today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $104.41, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Furthermore, CF Industries Holdings’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will CF Industries Holdings generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of CF Industries Holdings, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? CF seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CF for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on CF should the price fluctuate below its true value.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

9,4789ed35-a8a0-3139-90c7-9eb38794eaf7,WMT,2023-01-03,Is Weakness In Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-130024259.html,1672750824,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has had a rough month with its share price down 7.5%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Walmart's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Walmart How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Walmart is:11% = US$9.1b ÷ US$80b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Walmart's Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, Walmart seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 13%. This certainly adds some context to Walmart's moderate 7.5% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Walmart's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is WMT worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether WMT is currently mispriced by the market.Is Walmart Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Walmart has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 45% (or a retention ratio of 55%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, Walmart has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 35% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 21%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Walmart's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

For more such companies, go to 5 Most Influential Companies to Invest In.An average human these days seems to be continually under the influence of major companies. You wake up in the morning thanks to the alarm set on your smartphone, commute to your office via Uber or your own car courtesy of a major car company, order a snack in your office thanks to food delivery services operated by major companies, enjoy a late-night movie on a streaming service operated by streaming giants like Netflix or Amazon, and the list goes on and on. While corporate America often invites scorn of the masses, the fact is that these businesses and companies have brought prosperity to the common household. For example, a discussion paper by McKinsey last year outlined that the value added from businesses of any size or formality including corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships accounts for 72 percent of GDP in OECD countries. The discussion paper focused on OECD businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion and tried to identify how money from these businesses flow to a common household.The McKinsey report outlined an interesting figure: thanks to the economic impact of corporations, the top ten percent of households in the United States increased their share of capital income to 66 percent in 2018, from 59 percent in 1995, and received 30 percent of their income through the capital income pathway. However, the pattern broke outside the US. The figure for the share of capital income stood at 26 percent in Germany and 23 percent in Japan. That’s because population in the two countries rely heavily on pensions instead of major corporations.Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyFor this article, we first took a look at Time’s most influential companies for 2022 list.

Bears believe that we’re heading for a steep recession and a horrible macro environment for stocks, and many of them are looking for unprofitable growth equities to short. On the other hand, bulls are looking for bargains and starting to buy, buying growth stocks that they think will break out at some point next year. Some of the most exciting stocks to watch in 2023 are those over which the bulls and bears are fighting.Other names are important to watch because their fates will provide important indications about the direction of certain important sectors. I believe that, before the end of next quarter and possibly by the end of the upcoming earnings season, the bulls will start winning the battle. With that said, here are seven crucial stocks to watch in 2023:TickerCompanyPriceNXPINXP Semiconductors$154.64TSLATesla$122.95PLUGPlug Power$12.00SHLSShoals$23.89XPEVXpeng$9.91BNGOBionano$1.43MGMMGM Resorts$32.79InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNXP Semiconductors (NXPI)A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) primarily focuses on making chips used by industrial companies and automakers.The shares have held relatively low during the recent tech downturn, dropping about 12% from their early December highs. That indicates that the bulls are buying the stock on dips, thwarting bears’ efforts to drive the stick further down. Nearly 5.5 million shares of the stock, representing around $750 million of value, were sold short as of Dec. 15.A rally by NXPI stock next quarter and a solid Q4 report by the chip maker on Jan. 30 will have positive implications for the shares of other companies that sell technology for automobiles. Among the stocks in the latter category are Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Strength by NXPI stock in the wake of its Q1 results would also bode well for automakers and other chip makers whose semiconductors are primarily incorporated into products used by industrial firms.Story continuesAmong the names in the latter sector are ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL).Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comAs Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has plunged in the last couple of weeks, I’ve noticed that the shares of many other electric-vehicle makers and clean-energy companies have also tumbled. Conversely, on Dec. 28, when TSLA stock broke its seven-day losing streak, many EV makers and solar stocks outperformed.For example, on Dec. 28, a day that the Nasdaq sank 1.35%, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) were flat, while Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) advanced 2.9%. During Tesla’s losing streak, those companies and their peers usually drastically underperformed the Nasdaq. Therefore, if Tesla can rally, many EV makers and clean-energy names will probably surge on its coattails. Conversely, if Elon Musk’s firm continues to falter in 2023, it will be a long, tough year for those firms.There are many reasons to believe that Tesla will make a comeback next quarter. In the U.S., its EVs will benefit from a new $7,500 tax credit, and in China, the economy and auto sales will likely be boosted by the country’s reopening.Meanwhile, the automaker stated that its factory workers in China would be getting nine days off for Chinese New Year, representing a day longer than their usual break for a holiday, versus the 17 days that Reuters had previously reported that the plant would be closed. The extra day’s vacation likely represents a gesture to the workers (who had to live at the factory during parts of the last two years because of Covid restrictions) rather than reflecting any downturn in demand for Tesla’s EVs.And as I’ve written in past columns, the Tesla Semi looks poised to generate big sales because it saves companies a great deal of money, while the valuation of TSLA stock is so much more reasonable now than it has been in past years.Plug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockPlug Power is building plants that produce “green” hydrogen and currently gets a significant portion of its revenue from fuel cells that power vehicles used in warehouses, such as forklifts. PLUG is also starting to sell electrolyzers that make green hydrogen, and it’s partnering with European automaker Renault to develop hydrogen-powered vehicles.Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have already agreed to buy large amounts of “green” hydrogen from Plug. Just two weeks ago, PLUG unveiled a deal to supply green hydrogen to hydrogen truck maker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). The announcement significantly boosted PLUG stock and many clean energy and electric-vehicle stocks, but PLUG and its peers were subsequently dragged back down by the market’s malaise and fears about Tesla.At the beginning of each year, PLUG traditionally unveils one or more major partners or customers. With the company due to present at Goldman Sachs’ Energy Conference in the first week of January, Plug could announce the news that will boost PLUG stock and other clean energy companies, as well as EV makers.Further, Plug Power has said that it expects its margins to improve throughout the year as its green hydrogen production ramps, and its joint venture with Renault is expected to start delivering vehicles in 2023. Additionally, PLUG, like TSLA, is expected to get a big lift from new tax credits that will kick in starting in January. Those developments could also boost PLUG stock and the names that trade with it.Shoals (SHLS)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comAnother battleground name in the clean energy sector, Shoals (NASDAQ:SHLS), markets equipment used in solar-energy systems. Investor’s Business Daily gives SHLS a very high Composite Rating of 93, with an extremely elevated Relative Strength, or RS, rating of 94. The RS score measures a stock’s performance versus that of the entire market over the last year.Before the market in general and TSLA stock in particular weakened in the middle of December, SHLS stock was rallying sharply, as it surged 18% between Dec. 7 and Dec. 15, reaching $28.15. The latter price was about 15% below its 52-week high of $32.43. If the market and the clean-energy sector rebound next year, there’s a good chance that SHLS will be off to the races once again.Like TSLA and PLUG, SHLS is expected to get a big lift from new tax credits that will kick in starting next month. In Shoals’ case, higher tax credits for solar energy should boost the demand for its products in the U.S. Meanwhile, and the company should also get a lift from the EU’s tremendous efforts to increase its utilization of solar energy.Xpeng (XPEV)Xpeng (XPEV) car dealership at night with white company logo on display above EVsSource: shutterstock.com/Robert WayXpeng (NYSE:XPEV) stock was really soaring before the mid-December downturn, as the shares of the Chinese electric-vehicle maker climbed nearly 70% in just a few days between Nov. 20 and Dec. 2. I attributed the jump to optimism about the automaker’s new, high-end SUV, the G9, along with bullishness on its autonomous-vehicle initiatives.During Xpeng’s third-quarter earnings conference call, held on Nov. 30, its CEO, He Xiaopeng, expressed his belief that the EV would “soon” be among the three best-selling, high-end electric SUVs in China. On the autonomous front, He noted that the automaker intends to introduce its “full-scenario advanced driver assistance product” in the third quarter of 2023, and the G9 is undergoing self-driving tests on “public roads.” The CEO stated that “we plan to be the first to realize autonomous driving with cost-effective mass-produced vehicles.”Strong sales of the G9 and major strides in autonomous driving could easily make XPEV stock a big, rapid winner once again in 2023.Bionano (BNGO)Bionano Genomics (BNGO) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the backgroundSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.comBionano (NASDAQ:BNGO) is another battleground stock that saw a huge rally thwarted by the market’s mid-December malaise and, I believe, by a determined effort by short sellers. It is worth noting that, as of Dec. 15, nearly 50 million of the 291 million BNGO stock were being shorted.The shares surged from $1.90 on Nov. 29 to $2.21 on Dec. 12. During that time period, the trading volume of BNGO stock tended to be much higher than average. For example, on Dec. 6, the shares jumped 8% to $2.16 on a trading volume of nearly 17 million, well above their average volume over the last three months of 7.69 million. Starting on Dec. 12, the stock began to decline on above-average trading volume.The high volumes, together with the sharp moves, indicate a tug-of-war between longs and shorts was going on during the first few weeks of this month, with bulls winning in the first half of the struggle and bears emerging victorious in the latter half.As I noted in a recent article, “Studies continue to highlight the ability of Bionano’s optical genomic mapping (OGM) tools to greatly advance scientific research and help enhance the condition of a multitude of patients.” Moreover, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has started to reimburse insurers for certain uses of Bionano’s Saphyr tool, which analyzes DNA’s structural variations.As Saphyr continues to prove that it can greatly enhance scientists’ research of diseases and save many lives and as more insurers agree to reimburse scientists and healthcare professionals for the use of Saphyr, Bionano’s financial results should greatly improve in 2023. As a result, the bulls will probably start emerging victorious again.MGM Resorts (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comMGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) stock has been relatively resilient during the market’s recent downturn, falling 13% from its Dec. 15 close of $37.64.The casino owner is the best, purest player in Las Vegas in the stock market, and Vegas is expected to get a big boost this year from the resumption of business travel, in-person conferences, and international travel. MGM should benefit tremendously financially from all of those developments.Additionally, in March, Sin City will host the NCAA basketball tournament and a major NASCAR race. Also importantly, MGM expects its sports-gambling joint venture, BetMGM, to become profitable in 2023. Additionally, Barry Diller, who has successfully turned around many companies, has a 16.5% stake in MGM stock.With all of these strong, positive catalysts and with MGM stock changing hands at a trailing price-earnings ratio of just 112, MGM is definitely one of the most exciting stocks to watch.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in PLUG,BB, SHLS, BNGO, XPEV, and MGM.

That compares with nearly 2.3 trillion rupees this year, the third official added.The officials declined to be named because the information was not public.The finance ministry declined to comment, while the food and fertiliser ministries did not immediately reply to requests for comment.A large part of the savings will come from the end of a COVID 19-era free food scheme, which will be replaced with a lower-spending programme, the first two officials said.That will effectively halve the free rations available to the poor in a year with a series of state elections, while general elections loom in 2024.The government is eager to tame its fiscal deficit, which is targeted at 6.4% of GDP for the current fiscal year.That is far above the average of 4% to 4.5% over the past decade, excluding the pandemic years when spending surged and the ratio peaked at 9.3%.The government plans to shave at least half a percentage point from the ratio in 2023/24, the first two officials said.The subsidy numbers will be announced on Feb. 1, when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the 2023/24 federal budget in parliament.The three officials said the latest subsidies estimates for 2023/24 may be adjusted when a final round of discussions takes place, by mid-January.The reduction in fertiliser subsidies is also driven by expectations of lower crude oil prices and the government's revised gas procurement policy for fertiliser companies, which came into effect earlier this month, two of the officials said.

She also warned that 2023 will be tougher than last year for major economies.Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a more cautious tone than markets were expecting in his New Year’s address, warning of more challenges as the country enters a new phase of its COVID-19 response. Beijing had begun relaxing anti-COVID measures in December, following a year of strict restrictions on activity.But this has resulted in an unprecedented spike in infections, which is likely to delay a full reopening this year.While the Chinese leader also estimated that the Chinese economy grew more than expected in 2022, markets expect this trend to be largely reversed in early-2023 as the country faces an overwhelming number of COVID-19 infections.Brent oil futures fell 0.8% to $85.34 a barrel in early Asian trade, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.7% to $79.72 a barrel. Still, both contracts gained 8.3% and 4.5%, respectively, in 2022, after logging wild price swings through the year.Crude markets were encouraged by the prospect of tightening global supply, after major producer Russia said it will block exports to any countries that abide by recently-imposed U.S. and European price caps on the country’s oil shipments.Weakness in the dollar also helped crude markets rally in recent sessions, as markets priced in the possibility of even smaller rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2023. The central bank is widely expected to hike interest rates by 25 basis points when it meets in February, amid increasing signs that U.S. inflation has peaked.Story continuesRelated ArticlesOil slips after year-end rally as growth concerns weighOil slides after IMF says slowing global growth engines portend tougher 2023Gold closes in on 6-mth high, markets look to smaller Fed rate hikes]"

The dollar index was last up 1% at 104.69.The euro was the worst-performing currency against the dollar, falling by the most since late September, after German regional inflation data showed consumer price pressures eased sharply in December, thanks in large part to government measures to contain natural gas bills for households and businesses.Data on U.S. payrolls this week are expected to show the labour market remains tight, while EU consumer prices could show some slowdown in inflation as energy prices ease.""Energy base effects will bring about a sizeable reduction in inflation in the major economies in 2023, but stickiness in core components, much of this stemming from tight labour markets, will prevent an early dovish policy 'pivot' by central banks,"" analysts at NatWest Markets wrote in a note.They expect interest rates to top out at 5% in the United States, 2.25% in the EU and 4.5% in Britain and to stay there for the entire year. Markets, on the other hand, are pricing in rate cuts for late 2023, with fed fund futures implying a range of 4.25 to 4.5% by December.""The thing that makes me nervous about this year is that we still do not know the full impact of the very significant monetary tightening that's taken place across the advanced world,"" Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering said.Story continues""It takes a good year, or 18 months, for the full effect to kick in,"" he said.Central banks have expressed concern about rising wages, even as consumers have struggled to keep up with the soaring cost of living and companies are running out of room to protect their profitability by raising their own prices.But, Pickering said, the labour market tends to lag the broader economy by some time, meaning that there is a risk that central banks could be raising interest rates by more than the economy can withstand.""What central banks are inducing is essentially excess cyclicality, which is - they overstimulated in 2021 and triggered an inflationary boom and then overtightened in 2022 and triggered a disinflationary recession. It’s exactly the opposite of what you want central banks to do,"" he said.Investors will get their first insight into central bank thinking later this week when the Federal Reserve releases the minutes from its December policy meeting.The minutes will likely show many members saw risks that interest rates would need to go higher for longer, but investors are conscious of how much they've risen already.On the markets, European shares rose thanks to gains in classic defensive sectors, such as healthcare and food and beverages. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk, Astrazeneca and Roche were among the biggest positive weights on the STOXX 600, along with NestleThe STOXX, which lost 13% in 2022, rose 1.1%. The FTSE 100 , the only major European index not to trade on Monday, rose 1.3%.U.S. stock index futures gained between 0.4-0.5% , pointing to an upbeat start at the opening bell.Markets have for a while priced in an eventual U.S. easing, but they were badly wrong-footed by the Bank of Japan's shock upward shift in its ceiling for bond yields.The BOJ is now considering raising its inflation forecasts in January to show price growth close to its 2% target in fiscal 2023 and 2024, according to the Nikkei.Such a move at its next policy meeting on Jan. 17-18 would only add to speculation of an end to ultra-loose policy, which has essentially acted as a floor for bond yields globally.The policy shift has boosted the yen across the board, with the dollar losing 5% in December and the euro 2.3%.The yen took a breather on Tuesday, easing 0.3% against the dollar to 130.96.

That compares with nearly 2.3 trillion rupees this year, the third official added.The officials declined to be named because the information was not public.The finance ministry declined to comment, while the food and fertiliser ministries did not immediately reply to requests for comment.A large part of the savings will come from the end of a COVID 19-era free food scheme, which will be replaced with a lower-spending programme, the first two officials said.That will effectively halve the free rations available to the poor in a year with a series of state elections, while general elections loom in 2024.The government is eager to tame its fiscal deficit, which is targeted at 6.4% of GDP for the current fiscal year.That is far above the average of 4% to 4.5% over the past decade, excluding the pandemic years when spending surged and the ratio peaked at 9.3%.The government plans to shave at least half a percentage point from the ratio in 2023/24, the first two officials said.The subsidy numbers will be announced on Feb. 1, when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the 2023/24 federal budget in parliament.The three officials said the latest subsidies estimates for 2023/24 may be adjusted when a final round of discussions takes place, by mid-January.The reduction in fertiliser subsidies is also driven by expectations of lower crude oil prices and the government's revised gas procurement policy for fertiliser companies, which came into effect earlier this month, two of the officials said.

Markets, on the other hand, are pricing in rate cuts for late 2023, with Fed fund futures implying a range of 4.25 to 4.5% by December.""The thing that makes me nervous about this year is that we still do not know the full impact of the very significant monetary tightening that's taken place across the advanced world,"" Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering said.Story continues""It takes a good year, or 18 months, for the full effect to kick in,"" he said.Central banks have expressed concern about rising wages, even as consumers have struggled to keep up with the soaring cost of living and companies are running out of room to protect their profitability by raising their own prices.But, Pickering said, the labour market tends to lag the broader economy by some time, meaning that there is a risk that central banks could be raising interest rates by more than the economy can withstand.""What central banks are inducing is essentially excess cyclicality, which is - they overstimulated in 2021 and triggered an inflationary boom and then overtightened in 2022 and triggered a disinflationary recession. It’s exactly the opposite of what you want central banks to do,"" he said.Investors will get their first insight into central bank thinking when the Federal Reserve releases the minutes from its December policy meeting later this week.The minutes will likely show many members saw risks that interest rates would need to go higher for longer, but investors are conscious of how much they've risen already.On the markets, European shares rose in early trading, with gains in energy stocks such as BP and Shell. The STOXX 600, which lost 13% in 2022, rose 0.6%. The FTSE 100, the only major European index not to trade on Monday, rose 1.4%.U.S. stock index futures gained between 0.4-0.5% , pointing to an upbeat start at the opening bell.Markets have for a while priced in an eventual U.S. easing, but they were badly wrong-footed by the Bank of Japan's shock upward shift in its ceiling for bond yields.The BOJ is now considering raising its inflation forecasts in January to show price growth close to its 2% target in fiscal 2023 and 2024, according to the Nikkei.Such a move at its next policy meeting on Jan. 17-18 would only add to speculation of an end to ultra-loose policy, which has essentially acted as a floor for bond yields globally.The policy shift has boosted the yen across the board, with the dollar losing 5% in December and the euro 2.3%.The yen took a breather on Tuesday, holding roughly steady against the dollar at 130.47. The dollar earlier touched a six-month low of 129.52 yen, while the euro fell to its lowest in three months at 137.45 yen.In commodities, oil and copper edged up, in spite of the strength of the dollar, although concern about demand in China, the world's second largest economy, kept gains in check.A batch of surveys had showed China's factory activity shrank at the sharpest pace in nearly three years as COVID infections swept through production lines.""China is entering the most dangerous weeks of the pandemic,"" warned analysts at Capital Economics.Brent crude rose 0.3% to $86.19 a barrel, while U.S. crude gained 0.5% to trade around $80.63, while London Metal Exchange copper prices were up about 0.9% at $8,452 a tonne.(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Bradley Perrett and Sam Holmes)]"

(NYSE:CRM) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/79-ownership-shares-salesforce-inc-120033587.html,1672747233,STORY,['CRM'],"[If you want to know who really controls Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 79% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Salesforce. View our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Salesforce. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Salesforce's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Salesforce. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.1%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.5% of the company stock. Furthermore, CEO Marc Benioff is the owner of 2.8% of the company's shares.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Salesforce, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$4.2b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Salesforce. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

PVH, Signet Jewelers SIG, Unum Group UNM, Aercap AER and Sterling Infrastructure STRL.5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Buy in the New YearValue investors have, over the years, preferred price-to-earnings ratio or P/E as a means to identify value stocks. However, in the case of loss-making companies that have a negative price-to-earnings ratio, the price-to-sales or P/S ratio is considered in determining their true value.However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. PVH Corp., Signet Jewelers, Unum Group, Aercap and Sterling Infrastructure are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:PVH Corp. specializes in designing and marketing branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, handbags and related products.PVH Corp. has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

For more such companies, go to 5 Most Influential Companies to Invest In.An average human these days seems to be continually under the influence of major companies. You wake up in the morning thanks to the alarm set on your smartphone, commute to your office via Uber or your own car courtesy of a major car company, order a snack in your office thanks to food delivery services operated by major companies, enjoy a late-night movie on a streaming service operated by streaming giants like Netflix or Amazon, and the list goes on and on. While corporate America often invites scorn of the masses, the fact is that these businesses and companies have brought prosperity to the common household. For example, a discussion paper by McKinsey last year outlined that the value added from businesses of any size or formality including corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships accounts for 72 percent of GDP in OECD countries. The discussion paper focused on OECD businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion and tried to identify how money from these businesses flow to a common household.The McKinsey report outlined an interesting figure: thanks to the economic impact of corporations, the top ten percent of households in the United States increased their share of capital income to 66 percent in 2018, from 59 percent in 1995, and received 30 percent of their income through the capital income pathway. However, the pattern broke outside the US. The figure for the share of capital income stood at 26 percent in Germany and 23 percent in Japan. That’s because population in the two countries rely heavily on pensions instead of major corporations.Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyFor this article, we first took a look at Time’s most influential companies for 2022 list.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) Stock's Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Decent: Will The Market Correct The Share Price In The Future?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paychex-inc-nasdaq-payx-stocks-132905630.html,1672666145,STORY,['PAYX'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Paychex's (NASDAQ:PAYX) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.3% over the past month. But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Paychex's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Paychex How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Paychex is:46% = US$1.5b ÷ US$3.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.46 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Paychex's Earnings Growth And 46% ROETo begin with, Paychex has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 15% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Paychex's moderate 8.6% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then compared Paychex's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is PAYX worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PAYX is currently mispriced by the market.Is Paychex Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While Paychex has a three-year median payout ratio of 80% (which means it retains 20% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Moreover, Paychex is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 76% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 45%.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Paychex has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

This company, which is in the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This agribusiness giant has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 26.92%.For the most recent quarter, ADM was expected to post earnings of $1.42 per share, but it reported $1.86 per share instead, representing a surprise of 30.99%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.75 per share, while it actually produced $2.15 per share, a surprise of 22.86%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor ADM, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.ADM currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.17%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) so let's look a bit deeper.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Synopsys:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$9.4b - US$2.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, Synopsys has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10% generated by the Software industry. View our latest analysis for Synopsys roceIn the above chart we have measured Synopsys' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Synopsys here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEThe trends we've noticed at Synopsys are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 18%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 76% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.The Bottom LineTo sum it up, Synopsys has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 256% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our  FREE intrinsic value estimation   that compares the share price and estimated value.While Synopsys may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Synthex / AbodeSouthwest Airlines capped off its 2022 with the unenviable distinction of cancelling more than 15,000 flights in total during the week of Christmas, the result of a system failure caused by several issues that were exacerbated by a nationwide winter storm.It was an unmitigated disaster for the Dallas-based airline, with the story leading news sites and network TV news broadcasts day after day, a public relations disaster that showcased its deficiencies in keeping its technology up to date.As the debacle was being scrutinized heavily in the media each step of the way, the airline’s CEO, Bob Jordan, made several statements and appearances in an attempt to get ahead of the unfolding crisis and improve public perception.Southwest Incoming CEO Bob JordanMeanwhile, the issues that other airlines faced during the storm were quickly remedied, no system shutdown needed.The primary reason for the major issue at Southwest was its outdated optimization technology, which the airline has outgrown over the past couple of decades. Company executives have admitted to prioritizing other things over investing in technology for operations, despite warnings from staff and some close calls previously. Paired with a staff shortage, the issue became too much for Southwest’s system to handle.“This one clearly pushed it over the cliff,” said Robert Mann, airline industry veteran and president of aviation consultancy R.W. Mann &amp; Co. “While they’re working this problem out, they’ve got to be absolutely certain that this never happens again.”But whether this can happen again is a legitimate question for the entire airline industry.Being behind technologically is a common criticism experts make of the aviation industry. Will it result in other meltdowns similar to Southwest’s?The airline’s disaster over the holidays should serve as a reminder for other carriers to take stock of their operations to ensure nothing like this happens again, and when it comes to looking where to cut costs, leave the technology alone.Story continuesNow the question is what Southwest will do next.What went wrong with the technology?There is always a backlog of updates that need to happen in the airline industry, but they get pushed aside in a system where safety and regulatory issues are paramountIt appears that was the case for Southwest — to the extreme.Unions said they had been warning Southwest of tech inadequacies for years and that the problem could have been avoided if the company would have invested in its own operations. Southwest had invested in some new technology, mostly customer-facing applications like self-service capabilities, as outlined in a public filing in early 2022. The filing also said the company had deferred a “significant number of technology projects” during the pandemic, though it did finish the “long-awaited milestone” of establishing a single system for all aircraft maintenance and record-keeping.Jordan told employees in a memo obtained by CNN that the airline has a lack of tools, and there has been talk internally about the need to modernize further.The main piece of failing tech was the airline optimization software called SkySolver, which is supposed to assign crew to flights using a complicated mathematical system. Southwest has grown beyond the capabilities of that old technology, which it began using when it was much smaller.On top of that, the airline flight crew has no front-end technology to input its whereabouts into that system, meaning the crew has to call a crew scheduler on the phone to share that information.The shortcomings of that system and its inability to catch up with the problem snowballed into the mass cancellation, which was needed to allow the system to reset.“As good as these companies are, as good as their brand halos seem to be, they all have warts that maybe people don’t see every day, but boy, they become pretty clear when you have a problem that involves them,” Mann said.How did an employee shortage contribute to the problem?Hand-in-hand with the tech issues, Southwest had a lack of workers that led to the CEO declaring a company state of operational emergency in Denver.The airline has been relying on employee overtime to staff operations. The union representing ground workers at Southwest said many of the employees had worked up to 18-hour days during the holiday season, and some experienced frostbite.The company sent a memo to its Denver ramp agents on Dec. 21 threatening their jobs if they did not comply with the operational emergency rules.“Looking particularly at that memo to the Denver staff, I think that’s illustrative of a serious cultural failure,” Mann said.During a time when the entire industry is facing a worker shortage, he believes that approach was counteractive.“This should have been done the way many other carriers did it, particularly after last summer. A lot of them decided to use a carrot, not a stick. They would be able to offer incentives for peak demand,” Mann said. “They don’t actually pay very much on those incentives, but at the end of the day, they get people to volunteer for work on their vacation days. The result is you take the stress level right out of the airline, and you get better results.What solutions will Southwest make?An immediate solution to keep a backlog from occurring would be to put a front end on the optimization system so employees don’t have to use the phone to update their whereabouts. Long term, the company would need to either build or contract an optimization system that it can grow into over its next phase of development, not one that it will outgrow again.It would likely take months to implement a new system.Southwest said in an emailed statement on New Year’s Eve:“It’s too soon to share a look ahead (beyond what’s been posted to SWAMedia.com) as we focus on our Operation over the holiday weekend. That work and analysis is a priority, and will be done in the coming weeks and months ahead.”Southwest posted some comments on Dec. 31 that it said were made by Jordan to employees, including, “We’ll move forward with lessons learned here, as we always do. We have plans to invest in tools and technology and processes, but there will be immediate work to understand what happened.”The airline will also need a plan to have more staff on hand.In response to a question about employee attraction and retention, the airline stated, “We’re proud to be an employer of choice and hired more than 17,000 new employees in 2022 with more hiring planned in 2023.”What’s at stake if Southwest gets this wrong again, or another airline stumbles?The federal government including the department of transportation has already said it is investigating the issue.Financially, Southwest is a stable company. It had said in December that it was going to start paying dividends to investors again, the first to do so post-pandemic.So, a financial failure likely isn’t the immediate concern, but it could be if business goes bad. The public typically has a short memory, even in situations like this, so Southwest has that going for it.“The brand damage has been done here in a big way. And so developing the trust of your employees, developing the trust of your customers, is going to be important, and you cannot afford another lost ship kind of moment with either of them.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's lofty.Philip Morris International hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Philip Morris International.How Is Philip Morris International's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as Philip Morris International's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 2.4%. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 17% in total. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 2.5% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.2% growth per year, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.With this information, we find it concerning that Philip Morris International is trading at a P/E higher than the market. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Philip Morris International's P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Philip Morris International's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 1 warning sign for Philip Morris International that you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Philip Morris International.

It has amassed assets over $436.64 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap BlendWith more potential comes more risk, and small cap companies, with market capitalization below $2 billion, epitomizes this way of thinking.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.31%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 19.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Sep 22 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYU2) accounts for about 2.19% of total assets, followed by Usd U.s. Dollar and Sm Energy Co (SM).The top 10 holdings account for about 5.52% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskGSSC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.Story continuesThe ETF has added about 0% so far this year and is down about -16.81% in the last one year (as of 01/03/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $50.18 and $67.49.The ETF has a beta of 0.97 and standard deviation of 30.37% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1278 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GSSC is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the iShares Core S&amp;P SmallCap ETF (IJR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 ETF has $52.28 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P SmallCap ETF has $64.88 billion.

SLB, Halliburton Co. HAL, RPC Inc. RES and ProPetro Holding Corp. PUMP.Industry: Oilfield ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2033802/4-oilfield-services-stocks-to-gain-from-the-prospering-industrySince the beginning of this year, the number of drillers in oil patches has increased significantly. Drilling activities will continue to rise since the crude pricing environment remains highly favorable. Thus, with explorers returning to prolific oil resources, demand for oilfield services will stay solid, making the outlook for the Zacks Oil and Gas- Field Services industry promising.Among the frontrunners in the industry that will possibly make the most of the improving business scenario are Schlumberger Ltd., Halliburton Co., RPC Inc. and ProPetro Holding Corp.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry comprises companies that primarily engage in providing support services to exploration and production players. These companies help in manufacturing, repairing and maintaining wells, drilling equipment, leasing of drilling rigs, seismic testing, as well as transport and directional solutions, among others.Also, the companies help upstream energy players locate oil and natural gas and drill and evaluate hydrocarbon wells. Hence, oilfield services businesses are positively correlated to expenditures from upstream firms.Furthermore, with countries worldwide investing heavily in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, a few oilfield service companies are extending their reach beyond the hydrocarbon fields and capitalizing on contracts for manufacturing equipment used in LNG facilities to decrease carbon emissions.3 Trends Defining Oilfield Services Industry's FutureHigh Oil Price: The price of West Texas Intermediate crude is trading higher than the $75-per-barrel mark, reflecting a handsome pricing environment. The high commodity price is favorable for exploration and production activities, which will boost demand for oilfield services since oilfield service players assist drillers in efficiently setting up oil wells.Story continuesDigital Solutions: Oilfield service players are creating value for clients through digital solutions. With the introduction of a digital platform strategy, companies belonging to the industry are not only accelerating returns but also reducing cycle time. From increasing productivity and efficiency, oilfield service players are also reducing costs and carbon emissions, thereby optimizing cashflows.Growth in International &amp; North American Markets: Given the favorable upstream business scenarios, it is highly likely that capital spending will ramp up in both North American and international markets. Thus, demand for oilfield services will continue to grow this year and beyond, securing higher earnings.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services is a 23-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #27, which places it in the top 11% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year.The industry has surged 56.1% over this period against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 22.3% and the broader sector’s 31.1% rally.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes not just equity into account but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non-cash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, the industry is currently trading at 9.81X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.41X and sector’s 3.13X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 12.06X, as low as 0.97X, with a median of 7.55X.4 Oilfield Services Stocks Moving Ahead of the PackSchlumberger Ltd.: Schlumberger is a well-known name in transforming the oil and gas industry with the employment of its cutting-edge solutions. With its quantifiably proven solutions, SLB is lowering emissions and its impacts. Over the past 30 days, Schlumberger, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2022 and 2023, respectively.ProPetro Holding Corp: The business scenario for ProPetro Holding is bright, given the current favorable oilfield service demand. Thus, it secures handsome cashflows as it is a leading provider of pressure pumping and other complementary services.For 2022 and 2023, Zacks #2 Ranked ProPetro Holding is likely to see earnings growth of 145.3% and 814.8%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Halliburton Co.: Halliburton is also a leading oilfield service player, capitalizing on improving demand for oilfield services. HAL is expecting continued growth in revenues in North America. Halliburton, with a Zacks Rank of 2, is also projecting activities to improve across the world, securing lucrative cashflows.RPC Inc: RPC is a leading energy name offering a wide range of oilfield services to key exploration and production players. It has a conservative balance sheet and a proven business model that can sail through numerous oilfield cycles.With a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold), RPC has strong capabilities in executing multi-stage completion activities in unconventional wells.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

This company, which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This world's largest oilfield services company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 19.77%.For the most recent quarter, Schlumberger was expected to post earnings of $0.55 per share, but it reported $0.63 per share instead, representing a surprise of 14.55%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.40 per share, while it actually produced $0.50 per share, a surprise of 25%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Schlumberger, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Schlumberger currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.38%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 20, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more such companies, go to 5 Most Influential Companies to Invest In.An average human these days seems to be continually under the influence of major companies. You wake up in the morning thanks to the alarm set on your smartphone, commute to your office via Uber or your own car courtesy of a major car company, order a snack in your office thanks to food delivery services operated by major companies, enjoy a late-night movie on a streaming service operated by streaming giants like Netflix or Amazon, and the list goes on and on. While corporate America often invites scorn of the masses, the fact is that these businesses and companies have brought prosperity to the common household. For example, a discussion paper by McKinsey last year outlined that the value added from businesses of any size or formality including corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships accounts for 72 percent of GDP in OECD countries. The discussion paper focused on OECD businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion and tried to identify how money from these businesses flow to a common household.The McKinsey report outlined an interesting figure: thanks to the economic impact of corporations, the top ten percent of households in the United States increased their share of capital income to 66 percent in 2018, from 59 percent in 1995, and received 30 percent of their income through the capital income pathway. However, the pattern broke outside the US. The figure for the share of capital income stood at 26 percent in Germany and 23 percent in Japan. That’s because population in the two countries rely heavily on pensions instead of major corporations.Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyFor this article, we first took a look at Time’s most influential companies for 2022 list.

In an article posted in New York Post, Mr. Fisher highlighted that in 1966, inflation was also at a high level, along with concerns related to a possible recession. Furthermore, the US Federal Reserve was increasing the benchmark interest rates to combat the raging inflation while the war in Vietnam was escalating. In 1966, the S&amp;P 500 Index experienced a decline of 22%. Similar to the market conditions in 2022, the downfall in 1966 started in January, and the market bottomed out in October. The market staged a comeback in the fourth quarter of 1966 and recorded a gain of 6% for the three-month period, followed by a YoY rise of 24% in 1967. The comeback is again similar to the 7.2% gain experienced by the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 1 this year.In one of his talks with Fox Business, Mr. Fisher said that the YoY growth in loans had touched 11.5%, indicating that the US economy is unlikely to enter a recession now. However, Mr. Fisher underscored the significance of stock compound growth in bearish markets and emphasized how long-term investment in portfolios might contribute to high returns for investors during an economic downturn. Some of the popular companies included in Ken Fisher’s Q3 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Ken Fisher's Top 15 Growth Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe have selected the top 15 growth stocks from the Q3 2022 portfolio of Fisher Asset Management. These stocks are actively gaining market share in their respective industries and have multiple growth catalysts to offer. Analysts expect these stocks to offer strong long-term returns to investors.Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Growth Stock Picks15. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 142Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $510,429,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.38%Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a San Francisco, California-based company that provides ride-hailing and food delivery services.Story continuesThe company holds a 72% share in the US ride-hailing industry. Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs believes that in the current macroeconomic situation, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is more focused on generating better bottom-line numbers and would be more controlled in making investments. The analyst added that themes like ordering food online for delivery and pickup have become more normalized after the COVID-19 pandemic and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a key player that can leverage this theme to support its growth momentum.RiverPark Funds shared its outlook on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Uber was our top contributor for the quarter on better-than-expected 2Q results, and 3Q EBITDA guidance that was well ahead of Street estimates. The company reported 33% Gross Bookings growth from both the continued recovery of Mobility Gross Bookings, up 55% year over year, and the continuation of Delivery Gross Bookings growth, up 7% year over year. Overall, revenue grew 105% year over year to $8 billion, generating $364 million of adjusted EBITDA, up $873 million year over year. Management guided to 25%-30% gross bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA of $440-$470 million for 3Q. Significantly, FCF was positive at $382 million, up $780 million year over year, and remains on track to be positive for the year allowing the company to self-fund future growth.UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the expectation of substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its more than 120 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as grocery delivery, truck brokerage (the company had $1.8 billion in Freight revenue for 2Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $10 billion of cash and investments against $9 billion of debt, the company today has an enterprise value of $57 billion indicating that UBER trades at only 1.5x next year’s estimated revenue.”14. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $672,960,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.5%Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a San Jose, California-based company that designs, develops, and manufactures a wide variety of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.On December 14, Ross Seymore at Deutsche Bank increased the target price for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock from $575 to $590 and reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst highlighted that investors would be looking for a bottom in terms of fundamentals and share price in the semiconductor sector in 2023. Experts believe Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered stellar Q4 2022 results that outperformed consensus estimates. The company also provided stronger-than-expected guidance for 2023. Broadcom Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) end markets performed well overall, and its strong cash flows enabled a sizable 12% increase in dividends. The stock offers a dividend yield of 3.33% as of December 30.ClearBridge Investments discussed its stance on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“However, ClearBridge portfolio companies are responding by supporting their workforces and showing resilience in adapting and thriving. Semiconductor companies ClearBridge owns and engages with have been successful in advancing vaccinations in their global supply chains. In Malaysia, for example, Broadcom has taken part in PIKAS, a public-private partnership vaccination program focusing on the workforce in critical manufacturing sectors. By the summer of 2021 Broadcom was able to get over 90% of workers in its Penang factory at least one dose of vaccine, and roughly 73% fully vaccinated. Companies in the program also pay the administration cost for vaccinations including cases where the employee is no longer employed by the company before full immunization of the employee.”13. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $830,364,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.62%Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a Fremont, California-based provider of equipment required for wafer fabrication in the semiconductor industry founded in 1980.On December 12, Sidney Ho at Deutsche Bank upgraded Lam Research Corporation’s (NASDAQ:LRCX) stock from a Hold to a Buy rating and also increased the target price by 30% from $400 to $520. The analyst highlighted that amongst the large-cap semiconductor equipment manufacturer, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) has the greatest memory exposure. The stock suffered in 2022 due to spending cuts by memory suppliers and export restrictions in China. However, the analyst anticipates a rebound in fortunes in 2024 as the spending on the memory industry is unsustainably low for 2023.Here’s what Vulcan Value Partners said about Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Lam Research Corp. designs and manufactures equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors. Recent supply chain issues have negatively impacted the industry and has resulted in chip shortages. The industry is performing well, exceeding our expectations, and Lam Research’s fundamentals remain strong. The long-term secular drivers of demand and growth in the industry continue to be very powerful. Lam Research is experiencing increasing returns on capital, higher margins, and more stable results.”12. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1,228,825,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.94%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a Santa Clara, California-based company known for manufacturing leading processors, graphic processing units (GPUs), and other applications, tools, and software.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock was selected as the ‘Top pick’ in the semiconductor space by Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley on December 15. The analyst has assigned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) a Buy rating along with a target price of $77. Experts anticipate Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to experience growth and gain market share in the cloud computing and server business in the coming quarters.Here’s what L1 Capital International said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The share price of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was weak during the quarter and weakened further in early October when the pre-announced revenue was significantly below prior guidance, reflecting an acute slowdown in the PC market. Data centre related revenue grew strongly, albeit below our expectations, while gaming and embedded revenue was in line with our base case.Geopolitical risks have increased for the semiconductor sector, with the U.S. Government announcing restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. Despite near term headwinds, AMD is well positioned for the medium term, with a technology lead over Intel in servers for data centres and rapidly gaining share in the PC/notebook sectors. Its gaming and embedded applications continue to grow strongly. AMD is a very capital light business, with manufacturing outsourced. After expending nearly $5b on research and development, AMD generates around $5b of free cashflow. With a net cash balance sheet, we expect management will accelerate buyback activity at a share price well below fair value.The share price of our more cyclical businesses, in particularly the building products companies which have exposure to the U.S. residential, repair and renovation and infrastructure sectors, were broadly flat for the quarter. Rapidly escalating mortgage rates and rapidly reducing affordability will have a pronounced negative effect on near term new residential construction activity. We believe these cyclical pressures are well understood and are more than reflected in current share prices. Overall, we strongly believe share prices are overly reflecting near-term challenges and our portfolio of companies are now meaningfully undervalued.”11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,415,171,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.06%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose, California-based software company known for providing creative, document, and marketing management solutions.On December 16, J. Parker Lane at Stifel increased the price target on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from $375 to $400 and kept a Buy rating on the stock. Lane shared that the company finished FY22 on a high as it reported a “record net new Digital Media quarter.” Furthermore, the management maintained the bullish guidance outlined during the analyst day in October. The analyst thinks the investors’ focus is likely to remain on the company's $20 billion acquisition of Figma, announced in September 2022, and its impact on the product roadmap for Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).Here’s what Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), the content creation and publishing software provider, was the largest detractor for the quarter. So far in 2022, Adobe has achieved record revenues with strength in all its businesses, as the acceleration toward digital has continued to drive content creation across industries. During the quarter, however, the company’s shares declined after announcing its plans to acquire Figma, a web‐first collaborative interface design platform, for $20 billion. What at first glance may seem like a steep price, Figma’s web‐based, multi‐player platform could accelerate the delivery of Adobe’s Creative Cloud technologies on the web, increasing Adobe’s reach and total addressable market. Management expects the deal to close in 2023 and the transaction to be accretive by the end of the third year of integration. As is the case with any significant acquisition, we will take our time to understand this deal’s rationale and follow management’s ability to take Figma to “new heights.” This has been the case with previous acquisitions, including Marketo and Magento (although each at a much smaller purchase price). In general, we admire management teams that are able to recognize the evolving needs of their clients and are unafraid of “competing with themselves” by developing new offerings. We will continue to study this acquisition and better understand the desire of content creators to collaborate over the web.”10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1,469,685,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.1%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara-California-based company founded in 1993 that invented the graphic processing unit (GPU). The company is a key player in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).Rajvindra Gill at Needham raised the target price for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 15% from $200 to $230 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock on December 19. The analyst highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock as his top pick for 2023 and added it to the Conviction list for the investment firm. Gill also added that the data center segment could face volatility in 2023, but NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers are shifting towards the H100 architecture.Here’s what Baron Funds said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,520,711,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.13%PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based operator of digital wallets and money management tools through its online payment system that operates in over 200 countries and supports 25 currencies.Ramsey El-Assal at Barclays increased the target price for PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) from $100 to $108 and reiterated an Overweight rating on December 12. Experts believe that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) could experience better top-line and bottom-line margins due to more partnerships and less investment in venture capital. The fintech companies are now expected to generate higher returns due to rising benchmark interest rates. This is expected to make the companies focus on their core competencies and not compete against their industry peers at all levels.Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”8. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,574,217,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.18%Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a Los Gatos, California-based digital streaming service provider with a presence in 190 countries and a subscriber count of 223.09 million as of 2022.Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer gave Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock a target price of $365, along with an Outperform rating on December 20. The analyst believes that the stock price performance of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be driven by the increasing number of subscribers. The subscriber count can be gauged by the viewership numbers shared by the digital streaming company from time to time. The analyst is confident that Netflix, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) new ad-based streaming service will not miss ad revenue targets in the short term.Here’s what Artisan Partners said about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals were two of our top contributors. Shares of Netflix got some relief after being under pressure in the first half of 2022. Media and entertainment stocks in general have been out of favor as investors grapple with the long-term economics of streaming services and slowing subscriber growth—what should be viewed as a normal feature of a maturing market. Our view is streaming is a scale and intellectual property business that will result in a few large winners, and we believe Netflix will be among this group. We initiated our position in Netflix in Q1 after shares fell by more than half due to concerns about subscriber growth and increasing competition from streaming upstarts. The stock then suffered a second down leg in April after the company reported subscriber losses for the first time in its history. Then in July, the company reported its second consecutive quarter of subscriber losses, but the nearly 1 million subscribers lost were much lower than the 2 million that management had forecast, and shares rallied on the news. For patient investors, there is reason for optimism that subscriber growth will turn around. The company has plans to crack down on password sharing and is launching a lower cost advertising supported tier. Our investment case is focused on an undemanding valuation, massive scale, a continued shift in time and attention from linear TV to streaming, and a financial condition which gives management the flexibility to operate unconstrained during a transition period for the business. We also believe Netflix can leverage its massive global scale of 200+ million subscribers into positive free cash flow though steady pricing increases and content spending controls.”7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 177Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,604,616,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.2%Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a Menlo Park, California-based technology conglomerate that owns leading social media and instant messaging platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan upgraded Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock from a Neutral to an Overweight rating and increased the price target on the stock from $115 to $150 on December 16. The analyst highlighted that the stock price of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lost 65% of its value YTD due to the amendments in the privacy policies by Apple, increased competition from TikTok, and other similar issues. However, the analyst anticipates the adverse impact of these developments to ease in the following year. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has also shown signs of improved control over costs, which is expected to give a boost to the company’s margins.ClearBridge Investments discussed its outlook on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks, underperformed in the third quarter (-15.9%) and is the Strategy’s largest detractor year to date. Meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer Alphabet, which we don’t own, as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e-commerce environment in early 2021, negative impacts from Apple’s privacy changes and rising expenses.While we have trimmed our position close to 20%, we remain invested as we do not think the stocks’ valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long-term earnings and free cash flow generation potential. Despite current revenue headwinds, we believe Meta is well-positioned to navigate industrywide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the Reels short-form video format will monetize in the coming years, helping to re-accelerate revenue growth.We also welcome Meta’s implementation of cost-cutting measures, which should help uncover the company’s high underlying profitability. Lastly, we see Meta’s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long-duration investors.”6. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1,722,650,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.29%Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a Hsinchu, Taiwan-based operator of semiconductor foundry.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is working on expanding its footprint in the European market by establishing a foundry in Dresden, Germany. The company is in the process of establishing a foundry in the US state of Arizona that will begin commercial production in 2024. The famous electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already placed an order with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), which will be produced at the company’s new facility.RiverPark Funds discussed its stance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Taiwan Semiconductor detracted from performance despite a business performance that saw revenue accelerate to over +30% growth. The Company is one of the few fabs in the world that is capable of manufacturing leading-edge integrated circuits (IC). The Company’s leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly by Apple, which has become an integrated circuit powerhouse over the past decade.The Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”In addition to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Ken Fisher also has a stake in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as of Q3 2022.

Netflix (NFLX), which belongs to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this internet video service has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 28.63%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Netflix came out with earnings of $3.10 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11 per share, representing a surprise of 46.92%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.20 per share, delivering a surprise of 10.34%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Netflix, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Netflix has an Earnings ESP of +30.32% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 19, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Banco do Brasil S.A. BDORY, Deutsche Telekom AG DTEGY and Phillips 66 PSX.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:3 Bargain Stocks You Wouldn't Want to Pass UpThe best stocks for you at any given time may not be the ones that everyone else seems to be buying.Because everyone isn’t making the same adjustments to their portfolios that you are. They haven’t got in when you have and they’re not getting out when you are. And because everyone else doesn’t have the same investment goals. Or the same attitude to risk.But whatever may be your personal situation with respect to your portfolio, or investment goals or risk appetite, some stocks are just too cheap to pass up.By cheap I don’t mean the absolute dollar value. Because when you pay for a penny stock, there’s no guarantee that it will generate solid profits or appreciate in value. It may not even be a particularly well-run business.What I mean by cheap is that at their current value, these stocks have low downside potential.Being large caps, they’re in any case less volatile. They’re well-run operations with experienced management. Their estimates have already been adjusted for the expected softening of the economy next year and the bad news is already priced in. In fact, they’ve been beaten so far down that current prices undervalue their sales and earnings growth potential.Analysts are optimistic about their long term (3-5 year) potential, irrespective of what might happen in the next year or so. And they also pay a dividend that can tide you over in case 2023 turns out to be tougher than we all expect right now.Story continuesSo here’s the list-Banco do Brasil S.A.Banco do Brasil S.A. provides banking products and services for individuals, companies and public sector operators in Brazil and internationally. The company operates through Banking, Investments, Fund Management, Insurance (Insurance, Pension, and Capitalization), Payment Methods and Other segments.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has a Value Score of A. Value scores are generally allotted to shares that are undervalued based on various valuation criteria. These often include a consideration of the company’s growth potential.In this case, Banco do Brasil’s price/sales (P/S) ratio is 0.47. A P/S of 1 indicates a fair valuation. A valuation of 0.47 means that investors are currently undervaluing its sales. The company’s price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio is 0.19 whereas a fair value would have been 1. Therefore, investors are significantly undervaluing its earnings growth potential.Unlike many other risky plays, analysts expect Banco do Brasil to generate earnings growth of 17.78% in the long term.

It is worth considering Phillips 66 (PSX), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry.This oil refiner has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 22.04%.For the last reported quarter, Phillips 66 came out with earnings of $6.46 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.98 per share, representing a surprise of 29.72%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $5.92 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.77 per share, delivering a surprise of 14.36%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Phillips 66 lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Phillips 66 has an Earnings ESP of +0.58% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

75,cee430db-27c6-3db1-b181-b1ca06e29d61,QCOM,2023-01-03,Wall Street Analysts Think Qualcomm (QCOM) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-qualcomm-143002896.html,1672669802,STORY,['QCOM'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Qualcomm (QCOM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Qualcomm currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.74, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.74 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.7% and 5.9% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for QCOMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for QCOMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Qualcomm here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Qualcomm, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is QCOM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $10.19.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Qualcomm. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Qualcomm with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Expedia Group How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Expedia Group is:15% = US$563m ÷ US$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15.Does Expedia Group Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Expedia Group has a lower ROE than the average (23%) in the Hospitality industry.roeThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high.  Our risks dashboard should have the 2 risks we have identified for Expedia Group.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesExpedia Group's Debt And Its 15% ROEExpedia Group does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.68. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

Lockheed Martin (LMT), which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This aerospace and defense company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9.39%.For the most recent quarter, Lockheed was expected to post earnings of $6.58 per share, but it reported $6.87 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.41%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.74 per share, while it actually produced $1.99 per share, a surprise of 14.37%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Lockheed lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Lockheed has an Earnings ESP of +0.23% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Boeing’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Boeing What Is Boeing Worth?According to my valuation model, Boeing seems to be fairly priced at around 0.46% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Boeing today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $189.61, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Boeing’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Boeing?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. In Boeing's case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 60%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? BA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on BA, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

87,0c495194-2e92-3295-9803-4291dfc3598c,SO,2023-01-03,"With 63% institutional ownership, The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/63-institutional-ownership-southern-company-120040802.html,1672747240,STORY,['SO'],"[Every investor in The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Southern. See our latest analysis for Southern ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Southern?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Southern does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Southern's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Southern is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.7%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.0% by the third-largest shareholder.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of SouthernWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Southern Company insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$163m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Southern (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

CEO Chip Bergh.Gap Inc. has been on the hunt for a successor for Sonia Syngal since July.The RealReal has been led by co-interim CEOs since June, when founder Julie Wainwright stepped down abruptly.Under Armour Inc. was set to be part of that list until naming Marriott president Stephanie Linnartz as its next CEO just before Christmas.More from WWDUp Close with The RealReal's 'Joy of Making and Creating' Recollection 04A Closer Look at Yeezy Gap Engineered by Balenciaga's Second DropIn Rising China, Global Retailers See Upward TrajectoryThere’s always some C-suite churn in fashion as companies make course corrections and CEOs plot their careers and retirements. But the executive exodus last year speaks to the dramatic changes in the market.The pandemic stop and start, the supply chain turmoil and finally ultra-high inflation and the very real threat of recession have made everything harder.In some cases the crowd of interim CEOs might be able to use their perch to make quick changes to right the ship before handing over control.At Kohl’s, for instance, Burlington veteran Tom Kingsbury is leading as interim CEO and is expected to move to get and keep the company’s inventory in line. And VF, which is being run by lead independent director and former Clorox CEO Benno Dorer, is rumored to be considering the sale of Jansport, potentially giving it some more breathing room as it refinances debt and turns around Vans.But soon decisions are going to have to be made.Story continuesAnd just who is running the show might make all the difference in the world, especially since new CEOs occasionally come in looking to lead big-time transformations with big-time risk.CEO searches are also harder today since the modern corporate chief has to be a multitasker. It is no longer enough to be good at retail or good at e-commerce, but brands of all stripes need to be good at both and figure out how to bring the two sides of the business together with the right balance.The trick this year will be getting it all right in the midst of a consumer slowdown, at best, and possibly a severe recession.]"

Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Owning real estate for passive income is one of the biggest investing myths — but it can work if you're smart. Find out how in 2 easy steps“People are less happy about the state of affairs than they were when things were way tougher,” Munger said earlier this year.“It’s weird for somebody my age, because I was in the middle of the Great Depression when the hardship was unbelievable.”Best known as Berkshire Hathaway’s vice chairman and Buffett’s long-time business partner, Munger also serves as the chairman of Daily Journal, a newspaper publisher with a sizable stock portfolio of its own.So if you’re hoping some of Munger’s blunt realism will rub off on you this year, why not borrow some of his investing picks too? If these three stocks can keep the 99-year-old investing veteran happy, maybe they’ll work for you too.Bank of AmericaDaily Journal held 2.3 million shares of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) at the end of 2022, worth approximately $76.2 million at the time. Occupying 44% of the portfolio, that makes the bank the largest publicly traded holding at Munger’s firm.With economic turmoil forecast for this year, it’s a savvy holding for Munger. While many sectors fear rising interest rates, banks look forward to them. That’s because banks lend money at higher rates than they borrow, then pocket the difference.When interest rates increase, the spread of a bank’s earnings widens.And it just so happens that Bank of America has steadily been upping its payout to shareholders.Story continuesLast summer, Bank of America boosted its quarterly dividend by 5% to 22 cents per share — and that’s after the company’s 17% dividend increase in July 2021.At the current share price, the bank offers an annual yield of 3.1%.Buffett likes the company, too, as Bank of America happens to be the second-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway.Read more: UBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classWells FargoWith approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is another heavyweight player in America’s financial services industry.

93,aff2128e-e114-3801-858a-492cfe5e3a5c,PFE,2023-01-03,The Year of the Tripledemic,News Direct,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tripledemic-100000722.html,1672740000,STORY,"['ICVX', 'PFE', 'GLAXF', 'GSK']","[Naples, FL --News Direct-- RazorPitch/BIXTCOVID-19 may have lost its daily news headline status, but the disease rages on with 2700 weekly deaths in the U.S. and millions of Americans chronically disabled from long-COVID, 4 million of which are being kept from work. This winter time, a terrible year for RSV as well as a potentially worse flu season could add insult to injury especially when one considers the fact that COVID-19 leaves some people with an impaired immune system similar to what HIV does to cause AIDS. The multiplication of disease could amplify the risks of influenza and RSV to result in more severe cases of these diseases which may result in increased deaths and morbidity. And that isn’t something our country nor the world can afford. There are already reports of Tamiflu generics being in short supply, and it’s just barely the New Year. Fortunately, there are several biotech and pharma companies advancing solutions for RSV, flu, and COVID, including two that may have a solution for all three of these viruses that are currently plaguing the U.S. However, deciding which ones are worth an investment in is not necessarily an easy task.5 Biotech and Pharma Companies Spearheading Viral TripledemicThe first company that everyone thinks of when considering COVID-19 solutions is Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). With the Comirnaty COVID vaccine and 3CL inhibitor Paxlovid, the company’s COVID antiviral, the company is in a market-leading position for COVID, raking in tens of billions in revenues for both products. What is less well-known is that Pfizer is also on a roll with RSV. The company announced in November that its RSV vaccine candidate used in maternal immunization for infants was effective against infant death, making it likely the first available maternal vaccine to protect against infant RSV death. The vaccine is also effective in older adults. And if that weren’t already enough, the company acquired ReViral and its RSV therapeutics for $525 million, including upfront and milestone payments, with an expectation that the therapeutics would bring in $1.5 billion to Pfizer. ReViral’s main candidate is a fusion inhibitor sisunatovir which is in phase 2. Pfizer is also initiating a phase 3 study for its influenza vaccine, making it a leader in the tripledemic. Indeed, its 2022 COVID revenue is expected to be over $50 billion.Story continuesBig Pharma competitors GSK (NYSE: GSK) and Roche are also key players in the tripledemic race. Roche was the initial innovator of the influenza antiviral blockbuster, Tamiflu, but the company has made recent progress with COVID, too. The company is well known for its IL-6 inhibitor (an anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody) approval in severe COVID-19. For next steps against influenza, the company has developed a new therapeutic called baloxavir marboxil, aka Xofluza, which unfortunately has some severe drawbacks in causing drug resistance mutations at quite a high rate such that it’s not necessarily a good choice for kids. This could derail its blockbuster follow-up to the Tamiflu success seen years ago. Roche is certainly outshined by Pfizer in the Tripledemic race.GSK’s progress is more straightforward. Known for its prowess in the antiviral space, GSK was granted a priority review and PDUFA date of May 23, 2023 from the FDA due to its RSV vaccine candidate achieving a high 82.6% efficacy in its pivotal trial. The company has early stage monoclonal antibodies and vaccines against influenza, as well as late-stage studies for COVID-19 vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. What’s missing are antiviral candidates for the diseases, and so while one might call GSK a leader in the tripledemic, they are also outshined by Pfizer.One smaller company, Icosavax (NASDAQ: ICVX), is advancing vaccine candidates for all three diseases, but the one drawback is that they’re not past phase 1 for any of their candidates.The company’s secret sauce lies in its VLP (virus-like particle), which allows viral proteins to be assembled more similarly to an actual virus and is supposed to improve the immune response compared to vaccines that use these proteins alone, like mRNA vaccines. The company recently hit the headlines with positive phase 1 clinical trial results for its RSV vaccine with sustained neutralizing antibody responses through 6 months; durability of response was a key reason for developing VLP vaccines. Icosavax is moving forward with this vaccine in combination with its hMPV virus-like particles as the only vaccine for the elderly population targeting the two leading causes of pneumonia. ICVX is particularly well funded with $229 million in current assets reported at the end of Q3 2022, which appears sufficient to support the company for more or less than 2 years based on their current burn rate.Unfortunately, for common yearly diseases like COVID, influenza, and RSV, vaccines are only a partial answer. Another small pharma company, Bioxytran Inc. (OTCMKTS: BIXT), might have antiviral treatment solutions for all three viruses. Bioxytran recently released slam-dunk results from their ProLectin-M antiviral, which had a 100% response rate reducing the viral load of COVID-19 patients to undetectable levels in just a few days, effectively curing every single patient on the drug. These results are unprecedented and quite possibly the best COVID antiviral results ever recorded. The company’s drugs are made using carbohydrate chemistry which usually means a benign safety profile. Unbeknownst to most investors, the company appears to be working on or considering treating other viruses including influenza and RSV, and if BIXT can show its RSV and influenza antivirals work like its COVID antiviral, then the company would have multiple potential blockbuster products. ProLectin-M is a phase 3 ready drug with results expected in 2023.ConclusionThese leading tripledemic companies are focusing on the current and future problems facing the nation. But when it comes to investment risk and reward, there are two clear winners. With respect to the bigger pharma companies with established sales, Pfizer is by far the undisputed COVID-19 champion with a forward P/E ratio of ~8x compared with GSK at ~11 and Roche at ~14. Market leadership typically comes with a premium price tag so Pfizer is clearly the best value when looking at market leadership and forward price/earnings ratios.However, multi-bagger returns are unlikely to be seen with big pharma. Bioxytran, however, appears to be a smaller biotech that could return multiples to investors. Big Pharma is licensing COVID-19 antiviral candidates from various biotech companies for hundreds of millions in deal value, and some of these companies are already worth that in market capitalization. When considering the value of each of the companies, Bioxytran stands out with just a $50 million market capitalization and a phase 3 ready COVID-19 antiviral that appears to best Paxlovid in effectiveness. This compares favorably to Icosavax’s $350 million market cap based on three phase 1 assets. With positive phase 3 results or a pharma licensing agreement, BIXT shares could see a rerating higher, potentially to the much more reasonable $350 million dollar range, or 7x the current price.Investors might consider a dual investment in PFE and BIXT to take advantage of the tripledemic and bolster portfolio returns.Razorpitch Inc. is a marketing communications and investor relations firm serving private, pre-IPO, and public companies.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to Ken Fisher’s Top 5 Growth Stock Picks.The founder of Fisher Asset Management, Ken Fisher, believes that the market circumstances in 2023 will be similar to those in 1967. In an article posted in New York Post, Mr. Fisher highlighted that in 1966, inflation was also at a high level, along with concerns related to a possible recession. Furthermore, the US Federal Reserve was increasing the benchmark interest rates to combat the raging inflation while the war in Vietnam was escalating. In 1966, the S&amp;P 500 Index experienced a decline of 22%. Similar to the market conditions in 2022, the downfall in 1966 started in January, and the market bottomed out in October. The market staged a comeback in the fourth quarter of 1966 and recorded a gain of 6% for the three-month period, followed by a YoY rise of 24% in 1967. The comeback is again similar to the 7.2% gain experienced by the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 1 this year.In one of his talks with Fox Business, Mr. Fisher said that the YoY growth in loans had touched 11.5%, indicating that the US economy is unlikely to enter a recession now. However, Mr. Fisher underscored the significance of stock compound growth in bearish markets and emphasized how long-term investment in portfolios might contribute to high returns for investors during an economic downturn. Some of the popular companies included in Ken Fisher’s Q3 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Ken Fisher's Top 15 Growth Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe have selected the top 15 growth stocks from the Q3 2022 portfolio of Fisher Asset Management. These stocks are actively gaining market share in their respective industries and have multiple growth catalysts to offer. Analysts expect these stocks to offer strong long-term returns to investors.Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Growth Stock Picks15. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 142Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $510,429,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.38%Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a San Francisco, California-based company that provides ride-hailing and food delivery services.Story continuesThe company holds a 72% share in the US ride-hailing industry. Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs believes that in the current macroeconomic situation, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is more focused on generating better bottom-line numbers and would be more controlled in making investments. The analyst added that themes like ordering food online for delivery and pickup have become more normalized after the COVID-19 pandemic and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a key player that can leverage this theme to support its growth momentum.RiverPark Funds shared its outlook on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Uber was our top contributor for the quarter on better-than-expected 2Q results, and 3Q EBITDA guidance that was well ahead of Street estimates. The company reported 33% Gross Bookings growth from both the continued recovery of Mobility Gross Bookings, up 55% year over year, and the continuation of Delivery Gross Bookings growth, up 7% year over year. Overall, revenue grew 105% year over year to $8 billion, generating $364 million of adjusted EBITDA, up $873 million year over year. Management guided to 25%-30% gross bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA of $440-$470 million for 3Q. Significantly, FCF was positive at $382 million, up $780 million year over year, and remains on track to be positive for the year allowing the company to self-fund future growth.UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the expectation of substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its more than 120 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as grocery delivery, truck brokerage (the company had $1.8 billion in Freight revenue for 2Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $10 billion of cash and investments against $9 billion of debt, the company today has an enterprise value of $57 billion indicating that UBER trades at only 1.5x next year’s estimated revenue.”14. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $672,960,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.5%Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a San Jose, California-based company that designs, develops, and manufactures a wide variety of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.On December 14, Ross Seymore at Deutsche Bank increased the target price for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock from $575 to $590 and reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst highlighted that investors would be looking for a bottom in terms of fundamentals and share price in the semiconductor sector in 2023. Experts believe Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered stellar Q4 2022 results that outperformed consensus estimates. The company also provided stronger-than-expected guidance for 2023. Broadcom Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) end markets performed well overall, and its strong cash flows enabled a sizable 12% increase in dividends. The stock offers a dividend yield of 3.33% as of December 30.ClearBridge Investments discussed its stance on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“However, ClearBridge portfolio companies are responding by supporting their workforces and showing resilience in adapting and thriving. Semiconductor companies ClearBridge owns and engages with have been successful in advancing vaccinations in their global supply chains. In Malaysia, for example, Broadcom has taken part in PIKAS, a public-private partnership vaccination program focusing on the workforce in critical manufacturing sectors. By the summer of 2021 Broadcom was able to get over 90% of workers in its Penang factory at least one dose of vaccine, and roughly 73% fully vaccinated. Companies in the program also pay the administration cost for vaccinations including cases where the employee is no longer employed by the company before full immunization of the employee.”13. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $830,364,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.62%Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a Fremont, California-based provider of equipment required for wafer fabrication in the semiconductor industry founded in 1980.On December 12, Sidney Ho at Deutsche Bank upgraded Lam Research Corporation’s (NASDAQ:LRCX) stock from a Hold to a Buy rating and also increased the target price by 30% from $400 to $520. The analyst highlighted that amongst the large-cap semiconductor equipment manufacturer, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) has the greatest memory exposure. The stock suffered in 2022 due to spending cuts by memory suppliers and export restrictions in China. However, the analyst anticipates a rebound in fortunes in 2024 as the spending on the memory industry is unsustainably low for 2023.Here’s what Vulcan Value Partners said about Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Lam Research Corp. designs and manufactures equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors. Recent supply chain issues have negatively impacted the industry and has resulted in chip shortages. The industry is performing well, exceeding our expectations, and Lam Research’s fundamentals remain strong. The long-term secular drivers of demand and growth in the industry continue to be very powerful. Lam Research is experiencing increasing returns on capital, higher margins, and more stable results.”12. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1,228,825,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.94%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a Santa Clara, California-based company known for manufacturing leading processors, graphic processing units (GPUs), and other applications, tools, and software.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock was selected as the ‘Top pick’ in the semiconductor space by Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley on December 15. The analyst has assigned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) a Buy rating along with a target price of $77. Experts anticipate Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to experience growth and gain market share in the cloud computing and server business in the coming quarters.Here’s what L1 Capital International said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The share price of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was weak during the quarter and weakened further in early October when the pre-announced revenue was significantly below prior guidance, reflecting an acute slowdown in the PC market. Data centre related revenue grew strongly, albeit below our expectations, while gaming and embedded revenue was in line with our base case.Geopolitical risks have increased for the semiconductor sector, with the U.S. Government announcing restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. Despite near term headwinds, AMD is well positioned for the medium term, with a technology lead over Intel in servers for data centres and rapidly gaining share in the PC/notebook sectors. Its gaming and embedded applications continue to grow strongly. AMD is a very capital light business, with manufacturing outsourced. After expending nearly $5b on research and development, AMD generates around $5b of free cashflow. With a net cash balance sheet, we expect management will accelerate buyback activity at a share price well below fair value.The share price of our more cyclical businesses, in particularly the building products companies which have exposure to the U.S. residential, repair and renovation and infrastructure sectors, were broadly flat for the quarter. Rapidly escalating mortgage rates and rapidly reducing affordability will have a pronounced negative effect on near term new residential construction activity. We believe these cyclical pressures are well understood and are more than reflected in current share prices. Overall, we strongly believe share prices are overly reflecting near-term challenges and our portfolio of companies are now meaningfully undervalued.”11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,415,171,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.06%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose, California-based software company known for providing creative, document, and marketing management solutions.On December 16, J. Parker Lane at Stifel increased the price target on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from $375 to $400 and kept a Buy rating on the stock. Lane shared that the company finished FY22 on a high as it reported a “record net new Digital Media quarter.” Furthermore, the management maintained the bullish guidance outlined during the analyst day in October. The analyst thinks the investors’ focus is likely to remain on the company's $20 billion acquisition of Figma, announced in September 2022, and its impact on the product roadmap for Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).Here’s what Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), the content creation and publishing software provider, was the largest detractor for the quarter. So far in 2022, Adobe has achieved record revenues with strength in all its businesses, as the acceleration toward digital has continued to drive content creation across industries. During the quarter, however, the company’s shares declined after announcing its plans to acquire Figma, a web‐first collaborative interface design platform, for $20 billion. What at first glance may seem like a steep price, Figma’s web‐based, multi‐player platform could accelerate the delivery of Adobe’s Creative Cloud technologies on the web, increasing Adobe’s reach and total addressable market. Management expects the deal to close in 2023 and the transaction to be accretive by the end of the third year of integration. As is the case with any significant acquisition, we will take our time to understand this deal’s rationale and follow management’s ability to take Figma to “new heights.” This has been the case with previous acquisitions, including Marketo and Magento (although each at a much smaller purchase price). In general, we admire management teams that are able to recognize the evolving needs of their clients and are unafraid of “competing with themselves” by developing new offerings. We will continue to study this acquisition and better understand the desire of content creators to collaborate over the web.”10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1,469,685,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.1%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara-California-based company founded in 1993 that invented the graphic processing unit (GPU). The company is a key player in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).Rajvindra Gill at Needham raised the target price for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 15% from $200 to $230 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock on December 19. The analyst highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock as his top pick for 2023 and added it to the Conviction list for the investment firm. Gill also added that the data center segment could face volatility in 2023, but NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers are shifting towards the H100 architecture.Here’s what Baron Funds said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,520,711,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.13%PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based operator of digital wallets and money management tools through its online payment system that operates in over 200 countries and supports 25 currencies.Ramsey El-Assal at Barclays increased the target price for PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) from $100 to $108 and reiterated an Overweight rating on December 12. Experts believe that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) could experience better top-line and bottom-line margins due to more partnerships and less investment in venture capital. The fintech companies are now expected to generate higher returns due to rising benchmark interest rates. This is expected to make the companies focus on their core competencies and not compete against their industry peers at all levels.Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”8. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,574,217,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.18%Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a Los Gatos, California-based digital streaming service provider with a presence in 190 countries and a subscriber count of 223.09 million as of 2022.Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer gave Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock a target price of $365, along with an Outperform rating on December 20. The analyst believes that the stock price performance of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be driven by the increasing number of subscribers. The subscriber count can be gauged by the viewership numbers shared by the digital streaming company from time to time. The analyst is confident that Netflix, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) new ad-based streaming service will not miss ad revenue targets in the short term.Here’s what Artisan Partners said about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals were two of our top contributors. Shares of Netflix got some relief after being under pressure in the first half of 2022. Media and entertainment stocks in general have been out of favor as investors grapple with the long-term economics of streaming services and slowing subscriber growth—what should be viewed as a normal feature of a maturing market. Our view is streaming is a scale and intellectual property business that will result in a few large winners, and we believe Netflix will be among this group. We initiated our position in Netflix in Q1 after shares fell by more than half due to concerns about subscriber growth and increasing competition from streaming upstarts. The stock then suffered a second down leg in April after the company reported subscriber losses for the first time in its history. Then in July, the company reported its second consecutive quarter of subscriber losses, but the nearly 1 million subscribers lost were much lower than the 2 million that management had forecast, and shares rallied on the news. For patient investors, there is reason for optimism that subscriber growth will turn around. The company has plans to crack down on password sharing and is launching a lower cost advertising supported tier. Our investment case is focused on an undemanding valuation, massive scale, a continued shift in time and attention from linear TV to streaming, and a financial condition which gives management the flexibility to operate unconstrained during a transition period for the business. We also believe Netflix can leverage its massive global scale of 200+ million subscribers into positive free cash flow though steady pricing increases and content spending controls.”7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 177Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,604,616,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.2%Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a Menlo Park, California-based technology conglomerate that owns leading social media and instant messaging platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan upgraded Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock from a Neutral to an Overweight rating and increased the price target on the stock from $115 to $150 on December 16. The analyst highlighted that the stock price of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lost 65% of its value YTD due to the amendments in the privacy policies by Apple, increased competition from TikTok, and other similar issues. However, the analyst anticipates the adverse impact of these developments to ease in the following year. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has also shown signs of improved control over costs, which is expected to give a boost to the company’s margins.ClearBridge Investments discussed its outlook on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks, underperformed in the third quarter (-15.9%) and is the Strategy’s largest detractor year to date. Meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer Alphabet, which we don’t own, as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e-commerce environment in early 2021, negative impacts from Apple’s privacy changes and rising expenses.While we have trimmed our position close to 20%, we remain invested as we do not think the stocks’ valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long-term earnings and free cash flow generation potential. Despite current revenue headwinds, we believe Meta is well-positioned to navigate industrywide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the Reels short-form video format will monetize in the coming years, helping to re-accelerate revenue growth.We also welcome Meta’s implementation of cost-cutting measures, which should help uncover the company’s high underlying profitability. Lastly, we see Meta’s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long-duration investors.”6. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1,722,650,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.29%Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a Hsinchu, Taiwan-based operator of semiconductor foundry.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is working on expanding its footprint in the European market by establishing a foundry in Dresden, Germany. The company is in the process of establishing a foundry in the US state of Arizona that will begin commercial production in 2024. The famous electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already placed an order with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), which will be produced at the company’s new facility.RiverPark Funds discussed its stance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Taiwan Semiconductor detracted from performance despite a business performance that saw revenue accelerate to over +30% growth. The Company is one of the few fabs in the world that is capable of manufacturing leading-edge integrated circuits (IC). The Company’s leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly by Apple, which has become an integrated circuit powerhouse over the past decade.The Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”In addition to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Ken Fisher also has a stake in Amazon.com, Inc.

For more such companies, go to 5 Most Influential Companies to Invest In.An average human these days seems to be continually under the influence of major companies. You wake up in the morning thanks to the alarm set on your smartphone, commute to your office via Uber or your own car courtesy of a major car company, order a snack in your office thanks to food delivery services operated by major companies, enjoy a late-night movie on a streaming service operated by streaming giants like Netflix or Amazon, and the list goes on and on. While corporate America often invites scorn of the masses, the fact is that these businesses and companies have brought prosperity to the common household. For example, a discussion paper by McKinsey last year outlined that the value added from businesses of any size or formality including corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships accounts for 72 percent of GDP in OECD countries. The discussion paper focused on OECD businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion and tried to identify how money from these businesses flow to a common household.The McKinsey report outlined an interesting figure: thanks to the economic impact of corporations, the top ten percent of households in the United States increased their share of capital income to 66 percent in 2018, from 59 percent in 1995, and received 30 percent of their income through the capital income pathway. However, the pattern broke outside the US. The figure for the share of capital income stood at 26 percent in Germany and 23 percent in Japan. That’s because population in the two countries rely heavily on pensions instead of major corporations.Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyFor this article, we first took a look at Time’s most influential companies for 2022 list.

For more such companies, go to 5 Most Influential Companies to Invest In.An average human these days seems to be continually under the influence of major companies. You wake up in the morning thanks to the alarm set on your smartphone, commute to your office via Uber or your own car courtesy of a major car company, order a snack in your office thanks to food delivery services operated by major companies, enjoy a late-night movie on a streaming service operated by streaming giants like Netflix or Amazon, and the list goes on and on. While corporate America often invites scorn of the masses, the fact is that these businesses and companies have brought prosperity to the common household. For example, a discussion paper by McKinsey last year outlined that the value added from businesses of any size or formality including corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships accounts for 72 percent of GDP in OECD countries. The discussion paper focused on OECD businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion and tried to identify how money from these businesses flow to a common household.The McKinsey report outlined an interesting figure: thanks to the economic impact of corporations, the top ten percent of households in the United States increased their share of capital income to 66 percent in 2018, from 59 percent in 1995, and received 30 percent of their income through the capital income pathway. However, the pattern broke outside the US. The figure for the share of capital income stood at 26 percent in Germany and 23 percent in Japan. That’s because population in the two countries rely heavily on pensions instead of major corporations.Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyFor this article, we first took a look at Time’s most influential companies for 2022 list. We scanned the list and picked only those companies that are also considered solid investments by elite hedge funds. How did we do that?

Over the last year, inflation hit a 40-year high. There were fears of a recession materializing, and those fears have persisted . Nearly 63% of U.S. consumers were living paycheck to paycheck. Markets were crushed. Home sales began to fall at the fastest rate in decades. Retail sales dropped, and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes became far too aggressive. Some of the biggest stocks in the market plummeted. The good news is some of 2022’s biggest losers could be among 2023’s biggest winners. Here’s a list of seven top stocks to buy on the dip.TGTTarget$148.37AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$64.20NFLXNetflix$291DDOGDatadog$72.64TSLATesla$121.50ARKKARK Innovation ETF$30.60SQBlock$61.50Target (TGT)Source: ShutterstockSince January, Target (NYSE:TGT) plummeted from about $227.50 to $148.37. But that’ll happen amid sky-high inflation and with many Americans living paycheck to paycheck.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEven worse, Target’s third quarter earnings per shares came in below analysts’ average estimate. Specifically, it reported EPS of $1.54, which was below the average outlook of $2.16.The company’s margins sank,  and TGT lowered its Q4 guidance. Target’s operating income fell almost 50% to $1 billion. The only good news was that the retailer’s revenue jumped to $26.5 billion, which was slightly above the mean estimate of $26.4 billion.However, don’t write the stock off just yet. For one, Target has a solid dividend  yield of 2.91%, and it also just recently increased its quarterly dividend to $1.08 a share.Secondly, its latest disasters will be temporary. Target still has a strong history of earnings growth, and just reported its 22nd consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases. Also worth noting is that research firm Bernstein just initiated coverage of the shares with an “outperform” rating on the stock and a price target of $190.Story continuesThe firm believes that Target’s fundamentals are still sound, so consider TGT one of the best stocks to buy on the dip.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Another one of the top stocks to buy on a dip is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which was crushed over the last year. After starting 2022 at around $151.65, AMD now trades at $64.20. The stock’s steep decline was caused by the stock market’s weakness, inflation, fears of recession, price target cuts on the stock by analysts, and plunging PC demand. That’s the bad news. The good news is that the future looks far brighter for AMD.It appears the worst-case scenario has been priced into the stock. Further, UBS upgraded AMD to a “buy” rating, with a price target of $95 a share. Investment bank Baird also just upgraded the beaten-down tech name to “outperform” with a price target of $100. The firm believes the company’s newest chips could increase its competitive advantage.In addition, Morgan Stanley named AMD its “top pick” heading into 2023. It has an “overweight” rating on the stock, with a price target of $77.Netflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockThe shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were clobbered over the last year. After starting the year at about $610, it collapsed to less than $200.The stock’s tumble came as COVID-19 lockdowns were terminated,  enabling consumers to return to movie theatres and restaurants, and as the company began to post underwhelming subscriber numbers. Making things worse, in April Netflix reported that it had lost net subscribes for the first time in ten years and watched as $50 billion was wiped off its market cap.Fortunately, that appears to have been the bottom for Netflix, as the company reported very strong Q3 results.Not only did it add 2.4 million subscribers in Q3 (above its own guidance of 1 million), but it stated that it expected to add another 4.5 million net new subscribers during Q4.NFLX also posted Q3 revenue of $7.93 billion and EPS of $3.10 a share, which came in ahead of the company’s previous forecast of $7.84 billion and $2.14 a share.For Q4 Netflix sees revenue of $7.78 billion and earnings of 36 cents a share. Even more impressively, analysts are upgrading the stock again.A former NFLX bear, CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon, gave NFLX a double-upgrade to a “buy” rating and increased his price target to $310. He likes the company’s new revenue streams from advertising, the lower price of its new ad-supported tier, and the increased  control that it’s supporting over shared subscription accounts.Now it’s also one of the top stocks to buy on the dip.Datadog (DDOG)Businessman is drawing a growing virtual hologram stock bar chart on dark blue background representing value stocksSource: Costello77 / ShutterstockDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) didn’t have a great year either. But I’d use its weakness as an opportunity to buy the stock, especially since DDOG is a leader in the $62 billion “observability” market.After all, observability is essential. It provides companies with insight into their metrics, traces and logs. It can also help determine when an attack occurred, provide insight into what attackers did while inside the company and help firms improve their security in the future.The company also continues to show signs of growth. In the third quarter, DDOG posted 61% year-over-year revenue growth, propelling its top line to $437 million. Even its net loss dropped to $14 million from $40 million during the same period a year earlier.DDOG had a net retention rate of more than 130%, which is extremely high for a software company. Billionaires are buying the beaten-down stock, including Stanley Druckenmiller, who purchased 790,000 of its shares.DDOG is trading at its lowest valuation in years and is another one of the strong stocks to buy on a dip.Tesla (TSLA)Interior of the Tesla Model 3Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the most hated stock on the Street. Since January, the EV stock has dropped more than 50%.Recently the shares have been plummeting on Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, which is leading to fears that he’s not paying as much attention to Tesla as in the past.There are also concerns that Tesla’s growth is slowing , sparked by the company’s announcement of a temporary halt at its Chinese factory and the $7,500 discount it’s giving to U.S. consumers .Despite all of the negativity, Tesla is still showing signs of life. In fact, its stock was up about 10% on Thursday after Elon Musk told reportedly staffers that, “Long-term, I believe very much that Tesla will be the most valuable stock on Earth.”Perhaps, with Tesla, it’s time to take Baron Rothschild’s advice: “The time to buy is when there’s blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own.” Or even Sir John Templeton’s advice to buy when others are excessively pessimistic.ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK)Illustration of an ETF in multiple sectors.Source: SWKStock / ShutterstockWe can even look at one of the worst-performing, most hated ETFs of 2022, the ARK Innovation ETF(NYSEARCA:ARKK). After starting the year around $97, the ETF now trades at $30.60, where it may be a buy.That’s because the valuation of many of the fund’s holdings are becoming too cheap to ignore. With an expense ratio of 0.75%, the fund’s top, severely undervalued holdings include Tesla, Roku(NASDAQ:ROKU), Block (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), and even Nvidia.While I’m not suggesting that you load up the truck with ARKK, it may be a good idea to take a small position in the name, given how undervalued many of its largest holdings have become.Block Inc. (SQ)The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.comBlock also had a terrible year. Since January, it fell from about $160 to $61.20, where it appears to have bottomed out. More importantly, the company just posted solid earnings.In its most recent quarter, SQ said its  gross profits grew 38% year-over-year to $1.57 billion. The gross profit from its Cash App was up 51% YOY to $774 million. And the gross profit of its Square seller business climbed 29% to $783 million. Also, in Q3, its total net revenue climbed 17% to $4.52 billion.Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane is a fan of the stock now, too. “Even as market volatility and concerns surrounding macro headwinds have weighed on SQ’s shares, we remain positive on the company’s fundamental trajectory heading into FY23,” he wrote, according to TipRanks.com.“In particular, we believe SQ will continue pulling levers to drive margin expansion as the company increases focus on reining in [its operating spending] while still investing for long-term growth.”On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for CSX The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At CSXIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Chairman, John Zillmer, sold US$516k worth of shares at a price of US$32.25 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$30.98. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. John Zillmer was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does CSX Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that CSX insiders own 0.08% of the company, worth about US$56m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At CSX Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by CSX insiders. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Markets, on the other hand, are pricing in rate cuts for late 2023, with Fed fund futures implying a range of 4.25 to 4.5% by December.""The thing that makes me nervous about this year is that we still do not know the full impact of the very significant monetary tightening that's taken place across the advanced world,"" Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering said.Story continues""It takes a good year, or 18 months, for the full effect to kick in,"" he said.Central banks have expressed concern about rising wages, even as consumers have struggled to keep up with the soaring cost of living and companies are running out of room to protect their profitability by raising their own prices.But, Pickering said, the labour market tends to lag the broader economy by some time, meaning that there is a risk that central banks could be raising interest rates by more than the economy can withstand.""What central banks are inducing is essentially excess cyclicality, which is - they overstimulated in 2021 and triggered an inflationary boom and then overtightened in 2022 and triggered a disinflationary recession. It’s exactly the opposite of what you want central banks to do,"" he said.Investors will get their first insight into central bank thinking when the Federal Reserve releases the minutes from its December policy meeting later this week.The minutes will likely show many members saw risks that interest rates would need to go higher for longer, but investors are conscious of how much they've risen already.On the markets, European shares rose in early trading, with gains in energy stocks such as BP and Shell. The STOXX 600, which lost 13% in 2022, rose 0.6%. The FTSE 100, the only major European index not to trade on Monday, rose 1.4%.U.S. stock index futures gained between 0.4-0.5% , pointing to an upbeat start at the opening bell.Markets have for a while priced in an eventual U.S. easing, but they were badly wrong-footed by the Bank of Japan's shock upward shift in its ceiling for bond yields.The BOJ is now considering raising its inflation forecasts in January to show price growth close to its 2% target in fiscal 2023 and 2024, according to the Nikkei.Such a move at its next policy meeting on Jan. 17-18 would only add to speculation of an end to ultra-loose policy, which has essentially acted as a floor for bond yields globally.The policy shift has boosted the yen across the board, with the dollar losing 5% in December and the euro 2.3%.The yen took a breather on Tuesday, holding roughly steady against the dollar at 130.47.

Rising interest rates had weighed heavily on metal markets in the past year.Spot gold prices rose 0.4% to $1,831.67 an ounce, while gold futures climbed 0.6% to $1,837.85 an ounce by 19:45 ET (00:45 GMT). Both instruments were trading close to their strongest levels since late-June.The yellow metal caught a flurry of bids towards the end of December, amid growing speculation that the Fed will enact an even smaller interest rate hike in February. Markets are now pricing in an over 90% chance that the central bank will hike rates by 25 basis points in its first meeting for the year, after it raised rates by a relatively smaller 50 basis points in December.This also helped gold outperform most risk-driven assets for the year, even as strength in the dollar and rising Treasury yields sapped safe-haven demand for the yellow metal.Other precious metals fared far better than gold in 2022. Platinum prices added over 10% amid concerns over supply shortages stemming from U.S. sanctions on Russian producers, while silver prices rose more than 4% on expectations of increased demand.Focus this week now turns to the release of the minutes of the Fed’s December meeting, due on Wednesday. Markets will be watching for any more signals from the central bank on whether it intends to further slow its pace of interest rate hikes in the coming months.Among industrial metals, copper prices jumped 0.6% to $3.8425 a pound, also benefiting from a weaker dollar.The red metal marked strong gains in recent sessions on bets that an economic reopening in China will help fuel a recovery in demand. The country is the world’s largest importer of copper.Story continuesCopper prices slumped nearly 12% in 2022 as economic growth in China was ground to a halt by COVID-related disruptions. But the country has now relaxed most of its strict anti-COVID measures.While this resulted in an unprecedented spike in local COVID infections, markets are betting on an eventual economic recovery as more facets of the country reemerge from nearly three years of lockdowns.Related ArticlesGold closes in on 6-mth high, markets look to smaller Fed rate hikesOil slides after IMF says slowing global growth engines portend tougher 2023Bolivia farm region blocks borders, grain transport as protests lead to clashes]"

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Verizon CommunicationsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Advisor, Tamara Erwin, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.77 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$39.40. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Tamara Erwin.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Verizon Communications insiders own about US$30m worth of shares. That equates to 0.02% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Does This Data Suggest About Verizon Communications Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Verizon Communications shares in the last quarter. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Verizon Communications insiders. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Verizon Communications you should be aware of.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to read about some more widely held stocks by individuals, go directly to 5 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.Investors at the stock market have not had the best of times in 2022. There is a strong possibility of a recession in the United States economy in early 2023 and the IMF predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% this year, the weakest pace since 2001 as GDP growth is projected to be only 1%. A tight labor market and rising wages will likely remain a key concern for businesses in the coming months. It is projected that the Fed will likely continue to raise interest rates in 2023. According to recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) research, it has been projected that core PCE inflation in 2023 will be 3.5%. The central bank will likely raise interest rates by at least another 0.5 percentage points by March 2023 to reach its goal. Various high-ranking Fed officials have recently signaled that they would like to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance throughout 2023.However, the investor exodus from the stock market has also created buying opportunities. As one of the oldest and best-performing investment vehicles in the United States - the benchmark indexes have rarely delivered back-to-back negative returns in consecutive years - investors are excited about the possibility of earnings season offsetting some of the blowback from rising rates. The possibility of peak inflation and a continued downward trend in prices has also boosted investor interest in the market. Some of the top stocks that could benefit from this recovery momentum include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Retail investors, who have become an important market force in recent years, are also likely to make a strong comeback at the market in light of easing concerns around inflation. Investments in high-growth stocks are thus projected to rise up exponentially in the coming months. Story continuesPhoto by Chris Liverani on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we picked the most popular stocks among retail investors. The companies listed below, from number 15 to number 11, were taken from the Modern Invest Summit Report. The report is based on a survey of 2,500 retail investors. The firms from number 10 to number 1 were taken from the Robinhood Investor Index. Robinhood is one of the most popular stock trading applications worldwide with a userbase of more than 23 million, as of the end of June 2022. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge funds having stakes in it as of the end of the third quarter. As you will see, it turns out that the top 5 stocks in this list are also extremely popular among hedge funds. This shows that hedge funds and retail investors agree about the long-term worth of these stocks.Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals15. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SEDG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We are well-positioned to participate in the accelerating energy transition. High and rising utility costs combined with policy support are driving increased penetration of home solar plus storage systems in Europe. Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries. This phenomenon is accelerating revenue growth for these companies.” 14. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45  First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) provides global photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions. On October 27, First Solar announced the third quarter results of 2022. The company reported net sales of $629 million and recorded 16.6 GW DC of net bookings since the previous earnings call. Year-to-date net bookings were 43.7 GW DC.On November 10, Argus analyst Bill Selesky maintained a Buy rating on First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) stock and raised the price target to $176 from $123, highlighting that the company's operating deficit was principally caused by the quarter's noticeably higher logistical costs.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in First Solar, Inc.

(NYSE:VZ) with 8 million shares worth more than $304.6 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Mawer Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged behind the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been impacted as the wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”12. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66     Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemical operations worldwide. Chevron’s Texaco Exploration &amp; Production reported that total oil and gas production in January 2022 was 5,09.62 boe/d. The oil production in 2022 stood at 3,682.74 bd.On December 19, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd maintained an Overweight rating on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock and lowered the price target to $199 from $206, highlighting markets with structural supply constraints and continuous capital discipline continue to provide duration visibility to the current cycle.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 66 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $27 billion in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), compared to 59 in the preceding quarter worth $26 billion.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) was one of them.

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh maintained a Neutral rating on Micron Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”10. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15  Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) a technology and automotive company, develops electric vehicle (EV) technologies. On December 21, Lucid Group announced that it has begun deliveries of Lucid Air in Europe. The first customers of their electric vehicle were from Germany and the Netherlands. The company launched in Europe with the limited production of two versions of Dream Editions. Lucid group traded higher after the news.On December 15, BofA analyst John Murphy resumed coverage of Lucid Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:LCID), compared to 16 in the preceding quarter worth $173.7 million.9. GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17    GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is a specialty retailer that provides games and entertainment products through its e-commerce properties and various stores in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. On December 7, GameStop posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting losses per share of $0.31, missing the market estimates by $0.03. The revenue over the period was $1.19 billion, down 8.5% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and missing the market estimates by $160 million.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) with 2 million shares worth more than $252 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Bireme Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Amazingly, GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is one of our only short positions to not fall in 2022. The stock trades at an $11.5b market cap, exceeding its pre-pandemic peak by billions of dollars. This is even though revenue is down 30% from the peak, gross margins are down 1500 bps, and the company has generated a negative free cash outflow of $700m in the last four quarters (we had to double-check that number because it is so high).Wall Street has consistently revised downward their estimates of Gamestop’s profitability, making its stock price stability in 2022 even more perplexing. Analysts currently estimate an EBITDA loss of around $400m, markedly worse than their estimates as of 2/3/22 of a loss of $60m. Their recently launched NFT marketplace will do nothing to fix their core business and comes about a year too late to be relevant in the NFT space. Instead, we see this as another example of a meme stock company hoping it can ape its way into a new business model, utilizing the popularity of the stock to drive new lines of business. We are not optimistic and think the $11.5b market cap drastically overestimates the capability of Gamestop to pivot into something more profitable. We find it unlikely that Gamestop books a GAAP profit ever again.”8. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18  AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) engages in the theatrical exhibition business. On December 22, AMC Entertainment announced a flotation of financial transactions.

Riley analyst Eric Wold maintained a Neutral rating on AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) stock and lowered the price target to $7.50 from $11, highlighting that with continued uncertainties surrounding film slate timing and production delays, the exhibition sector is taking a more cautious approach.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 18 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $120.6 million in AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), compared to 16 in the preceding quarter worth $407 million.7. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26  NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) designs, develops, manufactures, and sells smart electric vehicles in China. On January 1, NIO announced a record monthly delivery of 15,815 vehicles in December 2022, up 50.8% year over year. Deliveries consisted of 6,842 premium smart electric SUVs and 8,973 premium smart electric sedans. NIO delivered 40,052 vehicles in the fourth quarter, which was up 60% year-over-year.On December 29, China Renaissance analyst Yiming Wang maintained a Hold rating on NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stock and lowered the price target to $10.40 from $12.30, highlighting that the company's fourth-quarter deliveries are being delayed by ongoing COVID issues, which led to a reduction in delivery guidance.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 26 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $518.9 million in NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), compared to 25 in the preceding quarter worth $873.9 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Horos Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“At the beginning of April, the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors, provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed, as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over, and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”6. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47  Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of Ford trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles worldwide. On December 15, Ford Motors and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, a Chinese energy storage company, were looking at a plan to build a plant in Michigan or Virginia. The companies are building a plant to provide iron phosphate batteries for electric models.On November 30, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli maintained a Neutral rating on Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stock and raised the price target to $14 from $13, noting that the models were updated based on third-quarter results.   At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 47 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.2 billion in Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $608.8 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Leaven Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), have recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6% [2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.Suggested Articles:10 Best Uranium Stocks To Buy11 Best TaaS Stocks To Invest In11 Best Recycling Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

For more such companies, go to 5 Most Influential Companies to Invest In.An average human these days seems to be continually under the influence of major companies. You wake up in the morning thanks to the alarm set on your smartphone, commute to your office via Uber or your own car courtesy of a major car company, order a snack in your office thanks to food delivery services operated by major companies, enjoy a late-night movie on a streaming service operated by streaming giants like Netflix or Amazon, and the list goes on and on. While corporate America often invites scorn of the masses, the fact is that these businesses and companies have brought prosperity to the common household. For example, a discussion paper by McKinsey last year outlined that the value added from businesses of any size or formality including corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships accounts for 72 percent of GDP in OECD countries. The discussion paper focused on OECD businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion and tried to identify how money from these businesses flow to a common household.The McKinsey report outlined an interesting figure: thanks to the economic impact of corporations, the top ten percent of households in the United States increased their share of capital income to 66 percent in 2018, from 59 percent in 1995, and received 30 percent of their income through the capital income pathway. However, the pattern broke outside the US. The figure for the share of capital income stood at 26 percent in Germany and 23 percent in Japan. That’s because population in the two countries rely heavily on pensions instead of major corporations.Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyFor this article, we first took a look at Time’s most influential companies for 2022 list.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to Ken Fisher’s Top 5 Growth Stock Picks.The founder of Fisher Asset Management, Ken Fisher, believes that the market circumstances in 2023 will be similar to those in 1967. In an article posted in New York Post, Mr. Fisher highlighted that in 1966, inflation was also at a high level, along with concerns related to a possible recession. Furthermore, the US Federal Reserve was increasing the benchmark interest rates to combat the raging inflation while the war in Vietnam was escalating. In 1966, the S&amp;P 500 Index experienced a decline of 22%. Similar to the market conditions in 2022, the downfall in 1966 started in January, and the market bottomed out in October. The market staged a comeback in the fourth quarter of 1966 and recorded a gain of 6% for the three-month period, followed by a YoY rise of 24% in 1967. The comeback is again similar to the 7.2% gain experienced by the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 1 this year.In one of his talks with Fox Business, Mr. Fisher said that the YoY growth in loans had touched 11.5%, indicating that the US economy is unlikely to enter a recession now. However, Mr. Fisher underscored the significance of stock compound growth in bearish markets and emphasized how long-term investment in portfolios might contribute to high returns for investors during an economic downturn. Some of the popular companies included in Ken Fisher’s Q3 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Ken Fisher's Top 15 Growth Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe have selected the top 15 growth stocks from the Q3 2022 portfolio of Fisher Asset Management. These stocks are actively gaining market share in their respective industries and have multiple growth catalysts to offer. Analysts expect these stocks to offer strong long-term returns to investors.Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Growth Stock Picks15. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 142Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $510,429,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.38%Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a San Francisco, California-based company that provides ride-hailing and food delivery services.Story continuesThe company holds a 72% share in the US ride-hailing industry. Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs believes that in the current macroeconomic situation, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is more focused on generating better bottom-line numbers and would be more controlled in making investments. The analyst added that themes like ordering food online for delivery and pickup have become more normalized after the COVID-19 pandemic and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a key player that can leverage this theme to support its growth momentum.RiverPark Funds shared its outlook on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Uber was our top contributor for the quarter on better-than-expected 2Q results, and 3Q EBITDA guidance that was well ahead of Street estimates. The company reported 33% Gross Bookings growth from both the continued recovery of Mobility Gross Bookings, up 55% year over year, and the continuation of Delivery Gross Bookings growth, up 7% year over year. Overall, revenue grew 105% year over year to $8 billion, generating $364 million of adjusted EBITDA, up $873 million year over year. Management guided to 25%-30% gross bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA of $440-$470 million for 3Q. Significantly, FCF was positive at $382 million, up $780 million year over year, and remains on track to be positive for the year allowing the company to self-fund future growth.UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the expectation of substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its more than 120 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as grocery delivery, truck brokerage (the company had $1.8 billion in Freight revenue for 2Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $10 billion of cash and investments against $9 billion of debt, the company today has an enterprise value of $57 billion indicating that UBER trades at only 1.5x next year’s estimated revenue.”14. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $672,960,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.5%Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a San Jose, California-based company that designs, develops, and manufactures a wide variety of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.On December 14, Ross Seymore at Deutsche Bank increased the target price for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock from $575 to $590 and reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst highlighted that investors would be looking for a bottom in terms of fundamentals and share price in the semiconductor sector in 2023. Experts believe Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered stellar Q4 2022 results that outperformed consensus estimates. The company also provided stronger-than-expected guidance for 2023. Broadcom Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) end markets performed well overall, and its strong cash flows enabled a sizable 12% increase in dividends. The stock offers a dividend yield of 3.33% as of December 30.ClearBridge Investments discussed its stance on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“However, ClearBridge portfolio companies are responding by supporting their workforces and showing resilience in adapting and thriving. Semiconductor companies ClearBridge owns and engages with have been successful in advancing vaccinations in their global supply chains. In Malaysia, for example, Broadcom has taken part in PIKAS, a public-private partnership vaccination program focusing on the workforce in critical manufacturing sectors. By the summer of 2021 Broadcom was able to get over 90% of workers in its Penang factory at least one dose of vaccine, and roughly 73% fully vaccinated. Companies in the program also pay the administration cost for vaccinations including cases where the employee is no longer employed by the company before full immunization of the employee.”13. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $830,364,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.62%Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a Fremont, California-based provider of equipment required for wafer fabrication in the semiconductor industry founded in 1980.On December 12, Sidney Ho at Deutsche Bank upgraded Lam Research Corporation’s (NASDAQ:LRCX) stock from a Hold to a Buy rating and also increased the target price by 30% from $400 to $520. The analyst highlighted that amongst the large-cap semiconductor equipment manufacturer, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) has the greatest memory exposure. The stock suffered in 2022 due to spending cuts by memory suppliers and export restrictions in China. However, the analyst anticipates a rebound in fortunes in 2024 as the spending on the memory industry is unsustainably low for 2023.Here’s what Vulcan Value Partners said about Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Lam Research Corp. designs and manufactures equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors. Recent supply chain issues have negatively impacted the industry and has resulted in chip shortages. The industry is performing well, exceeding our expectations, and Lam Research’s fundamentals remain strong. The long-term secular drivers of demand and growth in the industry continue to be very powerful. Lam Research is experiencing increasing returns on capital, higher margins, and more stable results.”12. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1,228,825,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.94%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a Santa Clara, California-based company known for manufacturing leading processors, graphic processing units (GPUs), and other applications, tools, and software.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock was selected as the ‘Top pick’ in the semiconductor space by Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley on December 15. The analyst has assigned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) a Buy rating along with a target price of $77. Experts anticipate Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to experience growth and gain market share in the cloud computing and server business in the coming quarters.Here’s what L1 Capital International said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The share price of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was weak during the quarter and weakened further in early October when the pre-announced revenue was significantly below prior guidance, reflecting an acute slowdown in the PC market. Data centre related revenue grew strongly, albeit below our expectations, while gaming and embedded revenue was in line with our base case.Geopolitical risks have increased for the semiconductor sector, with the U.S. Government announcing restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. Despite near term headwinds, AMD is well positioned for the medium term, with a technology lead over Intel in servers for data centres and rapidly gaining share in the PC/notebook sectors. Its gaming and embedded applications continue to grow strongly. AMD is a very capital light business, with manufacturing outsourced. After expending nearly $5b on research and development, AMD generates around $5b of free cashflow. With a net cash balance sheet, we expect management will accelerate buyback activity at a share price well below fair value.The share price of our more cyclical businesses, in particularly the building products companies which have exposure to the U.S. residential, repair and renovation and infrastructure sectors, were broadly flat for the quarter. Rapidly escalating mortgage rates and rapidly reducing affordability will have a pronounced negative effect on near term new residential construction activity. We believe these cyclical pressures are well understood and are more than reflected in current share prices. Overall, we strongly believe share prices are overly reflecting near-term challenges and our portfolio of companies are now meaningfully undervalued.”11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,415,171,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.06%Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose, California-based software company known for providing creative, document, and marketing management solutions.On December 16, J. Parker Lane at Stifel increased the price target on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from $375 to $400 and kept a Buy rating on the stock. Lane shared that the company finished FY22 on a high as it reported a “record net new Digital Media quarter.” Furthermore, the management maintained the bullish guidance outlined during the analyst day in October. The analyst thinks the investors’ focus is likely to remain on the company's $20 billion acquisition of Figma, announced in September 2022, and its impact on the product roadmap for Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).Here’s what Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), the content creation and publishing software provider, was the largest detractor for the quarter. So far in 2022, Adobe has achieved record revenues with strength in all its businesses, as the acceleration toward digital has continued to drive content creation across industries. During the quarter, however, the company’s shares declined after announcing its plans to acquire Figma, a web‐first collaborative interface design platform, for $20 billion. What at first glance may seem like a steep price, Figma’s web‐based, multi‐player platform could accelerate the delivery of Adobe’s Creative Cloud technologies on the web, increasing Adobe’s reach and total addressable market. Management expects the deal to close in 2023 and the transaction to be accretive by the end of the third year of integration. As is the case with any significant acquisition, we will take our time to understand this deal’s rationale and follow management’s ability to take Figma to “new heights.” This has been the case with previous acquisitions, including Marketo and Magento (although each at a much smaller purchase price). In general, we admire management teams that are able to recognize the evolving needs of their clients and are unafraid of “competing with themselves” by developing new offerings. We will continue to study this acquisition and better understand the desire of content creators to collaborate over the web.”10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1,469,685,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.1%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara-California-based company founded in 1993 that invented the graphic processing unit (GPU). The company is a key player in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).Rajvindra Gill at Needham raised the target price for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 15% from $200 to $230 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock on December 19. The analyst highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock as his top pick for 2023 and added it to the Conviction list for the investment firm. Gill also added that the data center segment could face volatility in 2023, but NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers are shifting towards the H100 architecture.Here’s what Baron Funds said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,520,711,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.13%PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based operator of digital wallets and money management tools through its online payment system that operates in over 200 countries and supports 25 currencies.Ramsey El-Assal at Barclays increased the target price for PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) from $100 to $108 and reiterated an Overweight rating on December 12. Experts believe that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) could experience better top-line and bottom-line margins due to more partnerships and less investment in venture capital. The fintech companies are now expected to generate higher returns due to rising benchmark interest rates. This is expected to make the companies focus on their core competencies and not compete against their industry peers at all levels.Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”8. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,574,217,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.18%Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a Los Gatos, California-based digital streaming service provider with a presence in 190 countries and a subscriber count of 223.09 million as of 2022.Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer gave Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock a target price of $365, along with an Outperform rating on December 20. The analyst believes that the stock price performance of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be driven by the increasing number of subscribers. The subscriber count can be gauged by the viewership numbers shared by the digital streaming company from time to time. The analyst is confident that Netflix, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) new ad-based streaming service will not miss ad revenue targets in the short term.Here’s what Artisan Partners said about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals were two of our top contributors. Shares of Netflix got some relief after being under pressure in the first half of 2022. Media and entertainment stocks in general have been out of favor as investors grapple with the long-term economics of streaming services and slowing subscriber growth—what should be viewed as a normal feature of a maturing market. Our view is streaming is a scale and intellectual property business that will result in a few large winners, and we believe Netflix will be among this group. We initiated our position in Netflix in Q1 after shares fell by more than half due to concerns about subscriber growth and increasing competition from streaming upstarts. The stock then suffered a second down leg in April after the company reported subscriber losses for the first time in its history. Then in July, the company reported its second consecutive quarter of subscriber losses, but the nearly 1 million subscribers lost were much lower than the 2 million that management had forecast, and shares rallied on the news. For patient investors, there is reason for optimism that subscriber growth will turn around. The company has plans to crack down on password sharing and is launching a lower cost advertising supported tier. Our investment case is focused on an undemanding valuation, massive scale, a continued shift in time and attention from linear TV to streaming, and a financial condition which gives management the flexibility to operate unconstrained during a transition period for the business. We also believe Netflix can leverage its massive global scale of 200+ million subscribers into positive free cash flow though steady pricing increases and content spending controls.”7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 177Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1,604,616,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.2%Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a Menlo Park, California-based technology conglomerate that owns leading social media and instant messaging platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan upgraded Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock from a Neutral to an Overweight rating and increased the price target on the stock from $115 to $150 on December 16. The analyst highlighted that the stock price of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lost 65% of its value YTD due to the amendments in the privacy policies by Apple, increased competition from TikTok, and other similar issues. However, the analyst anticipates the adverse impact of these developments to ease in the following year. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has also shown signs of improved control over costs, which is expected to give a boost to the company’s margins.ClearBridge Investments discussed its outlook on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks, underperformed in the third quarter (-15.9%) and is the Strategy’s largest detractor year to date. Meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer Alphabet, which we don’t own, as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e-commerce environment in early 2021, negative impacts from Apple’s privacy changes and rising expenses.While we have trimmed our position close to 20%, we remain invested as we do not think the stocks’ valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long-term earnings and free cash flow generation potential. Despite current revenue headwinds, we believe Meta is well-positioned to navigate industrywide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the Reels short-form video format will monetize in the coming years, helping to re-accelerate revenue growth.We also welcome Meta’s implementation of cost-cutting measures, which should help uncover the company’s high underlying profitability. Lastly, we see Meta’s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long-duration investors.”6.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, 5 Best Performing Growth Stocks in 2022. Despite rebounding from their October lows, stocks were still down significantly in 2022 and market experts forecast a similar situation in 2023, at least in the beginning. With the Federal Reserve still increasing interest rates and the U.S. economy barrelling into a much-anticipated recession, investors are still uncertain, which will fuel further volatility in 2023. Greg McBride, CFA, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said in a report dated December 28: “Two-in-three economists are forecasting a recession in 2023, yet corporate earnings estimates haven’t come down to reflect that. If the economy continues to slow and quarterly earnings calls in January reveal a dour outlook for the year, corporate earnings estimates will be marked down and the market could have a renewed tumble.”However, some sectors are set to outperform despite a global economic downturn. Higher rates have battered growth stocks this year, but many value stocks have performed well, or at least comparatively better. Gerry Frigon, president and CFO of Taylor Frigon Capital Management, stated: “Stay focused on long-term strategies that seek to capitalize on innovative and growing businesses that are aiding the digital transformation of all enterprises.” This means investors should focus on long-term investment ideas and pick up high quality growth plays that are trading at discounts right now.

Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20YTD Share Price Gain in 2022 as of December 29: 90.99%P/E Ratio as of December 29: 42.55Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL) engages in land and resource management, and water services businesses. The company specializes in oil, gas and related hydrocarbons, power line and utility easements, and subsurface wellbore easements and commercial leases. It is one of the best performing growth stocks in 2022, with shares up nearly 91% year-to-date as of December 29. Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL) reported market beating results for the third quarter of 2022. The company announced Q3 GAAP earnings per share of $16.82, topping analysts’ estimates by $2.44.

Murray Stahl’s Horizon Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $2.6 billion. LRT Capital made the following comment about Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL) in its October investor letter:“Long time readers will know that we rarely invest in commodity businesses. However, there are periods in the market where commodity-based businesses outperform the broad indexes by a wide margin. Therefore, to have balance in the portfolio, we have long searched for a competitively advantaged company in the commodity space. We believe that Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL), meets that criterion. Formed out of assets of formerly bankrupt railroads, TPL controls the largest acreage of land in the Permian basin – the center of the US shale oil industry. The company has two main sources of income: 1) royalties from oil &amp; gas extracted on its properties – essentially a free call option on future oil prices and production; and 2) a water business which develops water resources and sells services to the fracking industry. We see TPL as an effective way to diversify the portfolio into a commodity exposed business that has a history of smart capital allocation and low risk of financial distress during periods of low oil prices. The company has no debt, and $281 million in cash. The company uses most of its cash flows to pay dividends and repurchase shares.”8. NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22YTD Share Price Gain in 2022 as of December 29: 50.05%P/E Ratio as of December 29: 671.00NOV Inc.

The company designs, manufactures, and commercializes systems, components, and products for oil and gas drilling and production, industrial, and renewable energy sectors worldwide. The company operates through three segments – Wellbore Technologies, Completion &amp; Production Solutions, and Rig Technologies. NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) reported a revenue of $1.89 billion in Q3 2022, up 41.0% from the prior-year quarter, beating market estimates by $70 million. NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) is one of the best performing growth stocks this year. On December 9, Raymond James analyst James Rollyson initiated coverage of NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) with an Outperform rating and a $30 price target. A sustained period of underinvestment, paired with high energy transition pressures, set up the current oil supply situation, for ""which there is no short term fix,"" the analyst told investors. Capital discipline and asset rationalization in the oilfield service sector has put a lid on how fast the industry could ramp back up, which ""portends a more bullish set up for a longer cycle with sustained free cash flow generation"" and an extended period of robust margins, the analyst added.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 22 hedge funds were long NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) at the end of September 2022, and Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 36.10 million shares worth $584 million. Here is what Heartland Advisors specifically said about NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Post Covid, the demand for oil has been strong, expected to exceed 100 million barrels a day.  Our sense is that energy service-related companies have entered the early innings of a positive earnings revision cycle, a rarity in the markets.  To take advantage of this, we own NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV), a leading oilfield services company that provides technical expertise, advanced equipment, and operational support for the oil and gas industry. NOV generated $4.6B in EBITDA in 2014, but just $230M last year, which speaks to the under investment in the broader energy patch. NOV’s outlook continues to improve though, as the company is now forecasted to produce over $600M and nearly $900M in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Interestingly, estimates are up ~10% since the start of the year and maintain an upward bias.”7. MRC Global Inc. (NYSE:MRC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22YTD Share Price Gain in 2022 as of December 29: 64.53%P/E Ratio as of December 29: 37.73MRC Global Inc.

With shares climbing nearly 65% year-to-date as of December 29, MRC Global Inc. (NYSE:MRC) is one of the best performing growth stocks in 2022. On November 8, MRC Global Inc. (NYSE:MRC) posted Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42, beating market estimates by $0.11. The revenue came in at $904 million, climbing 32% year-over-year, topping Wall Street consensus by $15.96 million. Stifel analyst Nathan Jones on October 11 maintained a Buy recommendation on MRC Global Inc. (NYSE:MRC) but lowered the price target on the shares to $15 from $16. Large indicators, and the firm's latest surveys, indicate a weakening of short cycle industrial demand, noted the analyst, who headed into Q3 reporting season for the Americas multi-industry group ""cautious on short cycle industrial"" and prefers energy, infrastructure, and water names in general.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 22 hedge funds were long MRC Global Inc.

(NYSE:MRC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“We also closed out of four names during the quarter. We took advantage of the rally of energy stocks to take profits in MRC Global, a distributor of pipes and valves for the exploration and production industry.”6. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.

Robinson Worldwide's (NASDAQ:CHRW) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-worldwides-nasdaq-135340923.html,1672667620,STORY,['CHRW'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide How Fast Is C.H. Robinson Worldwide Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has grown EPS by 24% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note C.H. Robinson Worldwide achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 24% to US$26b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

Robinson Worldwide Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$11b company like C.H. Robinson Worldwide. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they hold US$18m worth of its stock. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Even though that's only about 0.2% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to C.H. Robinson Worldwide, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.C.H. Robinson Worldwide offered total compensation worth US$10m to its CEO in the year to December 2021. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add C.H. Robinson Worldwide To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, C.H. Robinson Worldwide's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night.

For more such companies, go to 5 Most Influential Companies to Invest In.An average human these days seems to be continually under the influence of major companies. You wake up in the morning thanks to the alarm set on your smartphone, commute to your office via Uber or your own car courtesy of a major car company, order a snack in your office thanks to food delivery services operated by major companies, enjoy a late-night movie on a streaming service operated by streaming giants like Netflix or Amazon, and the list goes on and on. While corporate America often invites scorn of the masses, the fact is that these businesses and companies have brought prosperity to the common household. For example, a discussion paper by McKinsey last year outlined that the value added from businesses of any size or formality including corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships accounts for 72 percent of GDP in OECD countries. The discussion paper focused on OECD businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion and tried to identify how money from these businesses flow to a common household.The McKinsey report outlined an interesting figure: thanks to the economic impact of corporations, the top ten percent of households in the United States increased their share of capital income to 66 percent in 2018, from 59 percent in 1995, and received 30 percent of their income through the capital income pathway. However, the pattern broke outside the US. The figure for the share of capital income stood at 26 percent in Germany and 23 percent in Japan. That’s because population in the two countries rely heavily on pensions instead of major corporations.Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyFor this article, we first took a look at Time’s most influential companies for 2022 list.

If you want to read about some more widely held stocks by individuals, go directly to 5 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.Investors at the stock market have not had the best of times in 2022. There is a strong possibility of a recession in the United States economy in early 2023 and the IMF predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% this year, the weakest pace since 2001 as GDP growth is projected to be only 1%. A tight labor market and rising wages will likely remain a key concern for businesses in the coming months. It is projected that the Fed will likely continue to raise interest rates in 2023. According to recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) research, it has been projected that core PCE inflation in 2023 will be 3.5%. The central bank will likely raise interest rates by at least another 0.5 percentage points by March 2023 to reach its goal. Various high-ranking Fed officials have recently signaled that they would like to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance throughout 2023.However, the investor exodus from the stock market has also created buying opportunities. As one of the oldest and best-performing investment vehicles in the United States - the benchmark indexes have rarely delivered back-to-back negative returns in consecutive years - investors are excited about the possibility of earnings season offsetting some of the blowback from rising rates. The possibility of peak inflation and a continued downward trend in prices has also boosted investor interest in the market. Some of the top stocks that could benefit from this recovery momentum include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Retail investors, who have become an important market force in recent years, are also likely to make a strong comeback at the market in light of easing concerns around inflation. Investments in high-growth stocks are thus projected to rise up exponentially in the coming months. Story continuesPhoto by Chris Liverani on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we picked the most popular stocks among retail investors. The companies listed below, from number 15 to number 11, were taken from the Modern Invest Summit Report. The report is based on a survey of 2,500 retail investors.

High and rising utility costs combined with policy support are driving increased penetration of home solar plus storage systems in Europe. Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries. This phenomenon is accelerating revenue growth for these companies.” 14. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45  First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) provides global photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions. On October 27, First Solar announced the third quarter results of 2022. The company reported net sales of $629 million and recorded 16.6 GW DC of net bookings since the previous earnings call.

(NYSE:VZ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged behind the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been impacted as the wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”12. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66     Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemical operations worldwide. Chevron’s Texaco Exploration &amp; Production reported that total oil and gas production in January 2022 was 5,09.62 boe/d.

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh maintained a Neutral rating on Micron Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”10. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15  Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) a technology and automotive company, develops electric vehicle (EV) technologies. On December 21, Lucid Group announced that it has begun deliveries of Lucid Air in Europe.

(NASDAQ:LCID) stock with a Buy rating and $21 price target, noting that the company reported third-quarter results recently and raised $1.5 billion of capital through a common stock sale.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 15 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $99.5 million in Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), compared to 16 in the preceding quarter worth $173.7 million.9. GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17    GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is a specialty retailer that provides games and entertainment products through its e-commerce properties and various stores in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. On December 7, GameStop posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting losses per share of $0.31, missing the market estimates by $0.03. The revenue over the period was $1.19 billion, down 8.5% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and missing the market estimates by $160 million.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) with 2 million shares worth more than $252 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Bireme Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Amazingly, GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is one of our only short positions to not fall in 2022. The stock trades at an $11.5b market cap, exceeding its pre-pandemic peak by billions of dollars. This is even though revenue is down 30% from the peak, gross margins are down 1500 bps, and the company has generated a negative free cash outflow of $700m in the last four quarters (we had to double-check that number because it is so high).Wall Street has consistently revised downward their estimates of Gamestop’s profitability, making its stock price stability in 2022 even more perplexing. Analysts currently estimate an EBITDA loss of around $400m, markedly worse than their estimates as of 2/3/22 of a loss of $60m. Their recently launched NFT marketplace will do nothing to fix their core business and comes about a year too late to be relevant in the NFT space. Instead, we see this as another example of a meme stock company hoping it can ape its way into a new business model, utilizing the popularity of the stock to drive new lines of business. We are not optimistic and think the $11.5b market cap drastically overestimates the capability of Gamestop to pivot into something more profitable. We find it unlikely that Gamestop books a GAAP profit ever again.”8. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18  AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) engages in the theatrical exhibition business. On December 22, AMC Entertainment announced a flotation of financial transactions.

(NYSE:NIO) stock and lowered the price target to $10.40 from $12.30, highlighting that the company's fourth-quarter deliveries are being delayed by ongoing COVID issues, which led to a reduction in delivery guidance.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 26 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $518.9 million in NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), compared to 25 in the preceding quarter worth $873.9 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Horos Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“At the beginning of April, the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors, provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed, as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over, and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”6. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47  Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of Ford trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles worldwide.

Here is what the fund said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), have recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6% [2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.Suggested Articles:10 Best Uranium Stocks To Buy11 Best TaaS Stocks To Invest In11 Best Recycling Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3% in the week, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.December is usually one of the best months for the market, but this year, there was no Santa Claus rally. Wall Street fell on apprehensions of a still hawkish Fed looking to continue its tight monetary policy to curb inflation, a suddenly escalating Russia-Ukraine war and rising covid cases in China.The S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4% in 2022 and is in the bear market territory, falling 20% below its record high. The Nasdaq Composite is down 33.1%, with growth stocks getting a beatdown. Dow has fared relatively better with a “modest” 8.8% fall. All eyes will be on the Fed in the days and weeks to come and the direction it gives to the economy. Its failure to achieve a soft landing might have cataclysmic repercussions for the market.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

If you want to read about some more widely held stocks by individuals, go directly to 5 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.Investors at the stock market have not had the best of times in 2022. There is a strong possibility of a recession in the United States economy in early 2023 and the IMF predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% this year, the weakest pace since 2001 as GDP growth is projected to be only 1%. A tight labor market and rising wages will likely remain a key concern for businesses in the coming months. It is projected that the Fed will likely continue to raise interest rates in 2023. According to recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) research, it has been projected that core PCE inflation in 2023 will be 3.5%. The central bank will likely raise interest rates by at least another 0.5 percentage points by March 2023 to reach its goal. Various high-ranking Fed officials have recently signaled that they would like to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance throughout 2023.However, the investor exodus from the stock market has also created buying opportunities. As one of the oldest and best-performing investment vehicles in the United States - the benchmark indexes have rarely delivered back-to-back negative returns in consecutive years - investors are excited about the possibility of earnings season offsetting some of the blowback from rising rates. The possibility of peak inflation and a continued downward trend in prices has also boosted investor interest in the market. Some of the top stocks that could benefit from this recovery momentum include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Retail investors, who have become an important market force in recent years, are also likely to make a strong comeback at the market in light of easing concerns around inflation. Investments in high-growth stocks are thus projected to rise up exponentially in the coming months. Story continuesPhoto by Chris Liverani on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we picked the most popular stocks among retail investors. The companies listed below, from number 15 to number 11, were taken from the Modern Invest Summit Report. The report is based on a survey of 2,500 retail investors. The firms from number 10 to number 1 were taken from the Robinhood Investor Index. Robinhood is one of the most popular stock trading applications worldwide with a userbase of more than 23 million, as of the end of June 2022. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge funds having stakes in it as of the end of the third quarter. As you will see, it turns out that the top 5 stocks in this list are also extremely popular among hedge funds. This shows that hedge funds and retail investors agree about the long-term worth of these stocks.Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals15. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SEDG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We are well-positioned to participate in the accelerating energy transition. High and rising utility costs combined with policy support are driving increased penetration of home solar plus storage systems in Europe. Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries. This phenomenon is accelerating revenue growth for these companies.” 14. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45  First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) provides global photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions. On October 27, First Solar announced the third quarter results of 2022.

(NYSE:VZ) with 8 million shares worth more than $304.6 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Mawer Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged behind the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been impacted as the wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”12. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66     Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemical operations worldwide. Chevron’s Texaco Exploration &amp; Production reported that total oil and gas production in January 2022 was 5,09.62 boe/d.

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh maintained a Neutral rating on Micron Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”10. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15  Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) a technology and automotive company, develops electric vehicle (EV) technologies. On December 21, Lucid Group announced that it has begun deliveries of Lucid Air in Europe.

On December 7, GameStop posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting losses per share of $0.31, missing the market estimates by $0.03. The revenue over the period was $1.19 billion, down 8.5% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and missing the market estimates by $160 million.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) with 2 million shares worth more than $252 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Bireme Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Amazingly, GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is one of our only short positions to not fall in 2022. The stock trades at an $11.5b market cap, exceeding its pre-pandemic peak by billions of dollars. This is even though revenue is down 30% from the peak, gross margins are down 1500 bps, and the company has generated a negative free cash outflow of $700m in the last four quarters (we had to double-check that number because it is so high).Wall Street has consistently revised downward their estimates of Gamestop’s profitability, making its stock price stability in 2022 even more perplexing. Analysts currently estimate an EBITDA loss of around $400m, markedly worse than their estimates as of 2/3/22 of a loss of $60m. Their recently launched NFT marketplace will do nothing to fix their core business and comes about a year too late to be relevant in the NFT space. Instead, we see this as another example of a meme stock company hoping it can ape its way into a new business model, utilizing the popularity of the stock to drive new lines of business. We are not optimistic and think the $11.5b market cap drastically overestimates the capability of Gamestop to pivot into something more profitable. We find it unlikely that Gamestop books a GAAP profit ever again.”8. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18  AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) engages in the theatrical exhibition business. On December 22, AMC Entertainment announced a flotation of financial transactions.

In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”6.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), have recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6% [2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.Suggested Articles:10 Best Uranium Stocks To Buy11 Best TaaS Stocks To Invest In11 Best Recycling Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

(NASDAQ:HAS) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Hasbro The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$721.1mUS$855.0mUS$953.4mUS$1.04bUS$1.10bUS$1.16bUS$1.21bUS$1.26bUS$1.29bUS$1.33bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Est @ 11.51%Est @ 8.65%Est @ 6.65%Est @ 5.25%Est @ 4.27%Est @ 3.58%Est @ 3.10%Est @ 2.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$660US$716US$731US$727US$709US$683US$652US$618US$583US$548(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.6bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.0%) = US$19bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$19b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$7.7bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$14b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$61.0, the company appears quite good value at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hasbro as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.308. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for HasbroStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Paccar (PCAR), which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This truck maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 12.16%.For the most recent quarter, Paccar was expected to post earnings of $2.01 per share, but it reported $2.21 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.95%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.81 per share, while it actually produced $2.07 per share, a surprise of 14.36%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Paccar lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Paccar currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.51%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

For more such companies, go to 5 Most Influential Companies to Invest In.An average human these days seems to be continually under the influence of major companies. You wake up in the morning thanks to the alarm set on your smartphone, commute to your office via Uber or your own car courtesy of a major car company, order a snack in your office thanks to food delivery services operated by major companies, enjoy a late-night movie on a streaming service operated by streaming giants like Netflix or Amazon, and the list goes on and on. While corporate America often invites scorn of the masses, the fact is that these businesses and companies have brought prosperity to the common household. For example, a discussion paper by McKinsey last year outlined that the value added from businesses of any size or formality including corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships accounts for 72 percent of GDP in OECD countries. The discussion paper focused on OECD businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion and tried to identify how money from these businesses flow to a common household.The McKinsey report outlined an interesting figure: thanks to the economic impact of corporations, the top ten percent of households in the United States increased their share of capital income to 66 percent in 2018, from 59 percent in 1995, and received 30 percent of their income through the capital income pathway. However, the pattern broke outside the US. The figure for the share of capital income stood at 26 percent in Germany and 23 percent in Japan. That’s because population in the two countries rely heavily on pensions instead of major corporations.Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyFor this article, we first took a look at Time’s most influential companies for 2022 list.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-mondelez-international-120047326.html,1672747247,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.73bUS$4.04bUS$4.45bUS$4.92bUS$5.19bUS$5.40bUS$5.58bUS$5.75bUS$5.90bUS$6.05bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.01%Est @ 3.40%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.47% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$3.5kUS$3.6kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$138bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$138b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$74bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$110b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$66.7, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mondelez International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Mondelez InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Mondelez International, we've put together three relevant factors you should consider:Risks: For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Mondelez International (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does MDLZ's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

For more such companies, go to 5 Most Influential Companies to Invest In.An average human these days seems to be continually under the influence of major companies. You wake up in the morning thanks to the alarm set on your smartphone, commute to your office via Uber or your own car courtesy of a major car company, order a snack in your office thanks to food delivery services operated by major companies, enjoy a late-night movie on a streaming service operated by streaming giants like Netflix or Amazon, and the list goes on and on. While corporate America often invites scorn of the masses, the fact is that these businesses and companies have brought prosperity to the common household. For example, a discussion paper by McKinsey last year outlined that the value added from businesses of any size or formality including corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships accounts for 72 percent of GDP in OECD countries. The discussion paper focused on OECD businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion and tried to identify how money from these businesses flow to a common household.The McKinsey report outlined an interesting figure: thanks to the economic impact of corporations, the top ten percent of households in the United States increased their share of capital income to 66 percent in 2018, from 59 percent in 1995, and received 30 percent of their income through the capital income pathway. However, the pattern broke outside the US. The figure for the share of capital income stood at 26 percent in Germany and 23 percent in Japan. That’s because population in the two countries rely heavily on pensions instead of major corporations.Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyFor this article, we first took a look at Time’s most influential companies for 2022 list.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Coca-Cola has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola peKeen to find out how analysts think Coca-Cola's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Coca-Cola's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Coca-Cola's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 12% last year. The latest three year period has also seen a 26% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.5% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.2% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it interesting that Coca-Cola is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Our examination of Coca-Cola's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola that you need to be mindful of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Coca-Cola, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6.27%.For the last reported quarter, UnitedHealth came out with earnings of $5.79 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45 per share, representing a surprise of 6.24%.

In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.UnitedHealth has an Earnings ESP of +0.28% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 13, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Estée Lauder Companies'  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:35% = US$2.2b ÷ US$6.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Estée Lauder Companies' Earnings Growth And 35% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Estée Lauder Companies has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 18% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 18% net income growth seen by Estée Lauder Companies over the past five years. growthStory continuesNext, on comparing Estée Lauder Companies' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 19% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Estée Lauder Companies fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Estée Lauder Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 35% (implying that the company retains 65% of its profits), it seems that Estée Lauder Companies is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Estée Lauder Companies has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 38%. Regardless, the future ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is predicted to rise to 55% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Estée Lauder Companies' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive O'Reilly Automotive's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that O'Reilly Automotive has managed to grow EPS by 25% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note O'Reilly Automotive achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 9.3% to US$14b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of O'Reilly Automotive's forecast profits?Story continuesAre O'Reilly Automotive Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$53b company like O'Reilly Automotive. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$544m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Does O'Reilly Automotive Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?You can't deny that O'Reilly Automotive has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Before you take the next step you should know about the 3 warning signs for O'Reilly Automotive (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that we have uncovered.Although O'Reilly Automotive certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Principal Financial Group's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Principal Financial Group is:55% = US$5.3b ÷ US$9.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.55 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Principal Financial Group's Earnings Growth And 55% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Principal Financial Group has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 13% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Principal Financial Group was able to see a decent net income growth of 10.0% over the last five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Principal Financial Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 39%. Still, forecasts suggest that Principal Financial Group's future ROE will drop to 11% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Principal Financial Group's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide American Water Works Company with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for American Water Works Company American Water Works Company's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, American Water Works Company has grown EPS by 27% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Despite consistency in EBIT margins year on year, American Water Works Company has actually recorded a dip in revenue.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$48m. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 0.2% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like American Water Works Company, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.American Water Works Company's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$2.4m in the year prior to December 2021. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is American Water Works Company Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into American Water Works Company's strong EPS growth. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes American Water Works Company look rather interesting indeed.

There was no disruption to Schneider’s customers during the transition. The move is also a pivotal step in the carrier’s plans to double its intermodal size by 2030 and continue to reduce its carbon footprint.The supply chain leader has one of the largest intermodal fleets in North America, including more than 28,000 company-owned containers which accompany a fully deployed company-owned chassis fleet. Schneider now has access to more rail lanes as well as direct connections on transcontinental freight due to the partnership between the Union Pacific and CSX networks.""We believe the move in the West means we can offer our customers a distinct differentiator in the market,"" said Schneider Executive Vice President and Group President of Transportation and Logistics Jim Filter. ""The combination of more coast-to-coast connections and being the first fully asset-based carrier with company drivers, company-owned containers, and company-owned chassis to operate on the railroad will result in more consistent service and less time in transit. We see huge benefits with Union Pacific to successfully deliver a positive service experience for our customers and drivers.""Schneider and Union Pacific are working collectively to improve driver efficiency at terminals, further reducing delays in transit. The railroad’s additional lane options and consistent rail departure frequency provides customers with more options, better reliability, and ultimately greater control over the supply chain.Story continues""This is the beginning of a partnership built on a shared commitment to provide more sustainable intermodal services and reduce our carbon footprints,"" said Union Pacific Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales Kenny Rocker. ""We look forward to future growth as we leverage Union Pacific’s extensive network and Schneider’s innovative logistics offerings to provide unparalleled customer service.""""In addition to offering our customers more possibilities, the transition to Union Pacific is a crucial piece in furthering our sustainability goals,"" said Filter.Moving freight by rail has significant environmental benefits. One ton of freight can be moved 500 miles by rail on the equivalent of a single gallon of fuel. Working with Union Pacific provides a reduction in idling time and increased route optimization that leads to a cut in vehicle emissions. Additionally, Schneider announced in 2022 that it would be adding 92 battery electric vehicles to its intermodal operations in southern California, giving customers even more ways to cut emissions.Learn more about Schneider’s leadership in intermodal at: https://schneider.com/freight-shipping-solutions/intermodal.To learn more about sustainability at Schneider, visit: https://schneider.com/company/corporate-responsibility/sustainability.About SchneiderSchneider is a premier provider of transportation, intermodal and logistics services.
