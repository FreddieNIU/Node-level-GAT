For more top stocks, head on over to Bank of America's 5 Stock Picks for 2023. 2023 is turning out to be an interesting year for the stock market. After major technology and growth firms suffered massive losses on the market last year, within a month they have registered surprising gains that have questioned the pessimistic sentiment emanating from several quarters. For instance, while Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares were among the worst performers of 2022, year to date, the stock has appreciated by a massive 86%. Yet, Tesla isn't the only company making waves on the market. Two others, namely Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) lost more than half of their market capitalization last year. But lo and behold, as we settle into 2023, the duo's shares are up by 47% and 51%, respectively. Quite a turnaround if you ask us, but still a long way to go to retake previous heights.For the market as a whole, there are two key questions - both tightly related - that are on everyone's minds. 2022 was marked by the Federal Reserve's all out approach to battle inflation. This fight, fueled by rising interest rates, generates worries that the economy might head into a recession. So a debate on recession and interest rates continues to rage, and even investment banks have picked their sides. For instance, while The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that a recession can be avoided, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is of the opinion that it is possible one will strike the economy later this year. Another optimist among us is President Joe Biden, who in a fresh interview given to PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff, shared that not only does he not see a recession this year, but next year as well. President Biden simply responded to a question asking his thoughts on a recession this year by stating:No. Or next year. From the moment I got elected, how many of the experts are saying within the next six months is going to be recession?Story continuesHowever, analysts at the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) would like to disagree with the President. Not only do they believe that a recession is highly likely this year, but their strategy to deal with the uncertain economic outlook entails investing in bonds for the first half of this year and then switching to equities later on. The financial firm's sentiment on recession is as follows:A recession is all but inevitable in the U.S., Euro Area and UK: Expect a mild U.S. recession in the first half of 2023 with a risk that it starts later. Europe likely sees recession this winter [2022] with a shallow recovery thereafter as real incomes and likely overtightening pressure demand.Yet, since it's a sell side firm, Bank of America still has its favorite pick of stocks, and out of these, some of the best performing ones in 2023 so far are Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC).Bank of America's 15 Stock Picks for 2023Copyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We scoured the Internet to find out which stocks are Bank Of America's favorite picks for 2023.

4,47198e25-97c8-3f2b-8a88-2c0ae6eca486,NUE,2023-02-11,Nucor's (NYSE:NUE) three-year total shareholder returns outpace the underlying earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucors-nyse-nue-three-total-110052136.html,1676113252,STORY,['NUE'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) share price has soared 248% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 18% gain in the last three months. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.While the stock has fallen 7.1% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Nucor There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Nucor was able to grow its EPS at 94% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 52% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 5.46 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Nucor has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling Nucor stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Nucor, it has a TSR of 274% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Nucor has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 41% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 22%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Nucor better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Nucor (1 is concerning)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including SAP SE (SAP), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) and TC Energy Corp. (TRP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of SAP have declined -1.4% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s decline of -9.7%. The company’s performance is affected due to continued softness in software licenses and the support business segment, coupled with supply chain constraints, global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability. Also, increasing research &amp; development and sales &amp; marketing expenses to cope with intensifying competition in the cloud space are concerns.However, SAP’s Q1 performance benefited from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new ""Rise with SAP"" solution) across all regions. There is momentum in SAP’s business technology platform, particularly the S/4HANA solutions.The company’s restructuring plan is expected to better align its operating models and go-to-market approach with its accelerated cloud transformation. Frequent product launches like SAP Build and strategic collaborations bode well.(You can read the full research report on SAP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Northrop Grumman’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. -8.1%). The company continues to witness strong demand for its products, driven by programs like F-35, Triton and SABR radar Global Hawk. Solid U.S. budgetary provisions make the analyst confident about a solid contract inflow from the Pentagon. Northrop also holds a strong solvency position.However, a comparative analysis of the stock’s trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture. The prolonged impact of COVID-19 may cause extended disruptions in its supply chain. High inflation rates across the U.S. might also hurt the stock. It expects further impacts related to the conflict in Ukraine and economic sanctions imposed on Russia.(You can read the full research report on Northrop Grumman here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Calgary, Alberta-based TC Energy have underperformed the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry over the past year (-22.1% vs. +4.0%). The company is witnessing continued timing and cost overrun issues over large construction projects, plus the cancellation of Keystone XL, are major overhangs.Story continuesMoreover, further share price appreciation will likely be tied to the progress on its debt reduction front, which sits at a massive C$40.92 billion. Therefore, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.Nevertheless, TC Energy is predominantly a natural gas pipeline operator, with operations spanning Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. A quality stock with industry-leading wide-moat assets, TC Energy has a secured portfolio of C$34 billion in growth projects.This should support the company’s stated dividend growth commitment of 3-5% annually in the future. TC Energy’s takeover of its TC Pipelines unit last year has helped it to improve corporate governance and lower the cost of capital.(You can read the full research report on TC Energy here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Nucor Corp.

(EXR) and MGM Resorts International (MGM).Mark VickerySenior EditorNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Yet, a development boom in many markets might intensify competition.MGM Resorts (MGM) Banks on Sport Betting, Traffic Woes Stay Per the Zacks analyst, MGM Resorts is likely to benefit from sports betting expansion, asset light strategy and non-gaming activities. However, subdued visitation in Macau region remain concerns.Increasing Transaction Fees Aids Cboe Global Market (CBOE) Per the Zacks analyst, Cboe Global is set to grow on increasing transaction fees driven by trading volume growth given strength in its proprietary products. However, rising expenses concerns.Pro-Investor Steps Aid Robert Half (RHI), Liquidity HurtsThe Zacks analyst is impressed by Robert Half's commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends &amp; buybacks. However, decreasing current ratio is worrisome.Investments, Permian Assets Aid Plains All American (PAA)Per the Zacks analyst Plains All American Pipelines will gain from systematic investments to expand its operation and its wide presence in Permian Basin through organic projects and JVs.Masimo (MASI) Rides on a Slew of Positive Study OutcomesThe Zacks analyst is upbeat about Masimo's products being subject of various studies over the past few months despite its operation in a highly competitive market.Litigation Woes Hurt Bausch (BHC) Amid Business SeparationPer the Zacks Analyst, Bausch's decision to separate eye health business makes sense but the patent litigation for Xifaxan and an earlier-than-expected generic entry will adversely impact sales.New UpgradesNucor (NUE) Gains on Strong Demand, Expansion ActionsPer the Zacks analyst, Nucor will benefit from strong demand in its major end markets. Efforts to boost production capacity through several growth projects will also drive profitability.CNA Financial (CNA) Poised to Grow on Improving PremiumsPer the Zacks analyst, CNA Financial is poised to row on rising premiums driven by compelling product portfolio, better retention, improving pricing, and new business growth.Deckers' (DECK) Omni-Channel Expansion Efforts on TrackPer the Zacks analyst, Deckers has been constantly developing its e-commerce portal to capture higher sales. Direct-to-consumer net sales rose 18.7% during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.New DowngradesNuStar Energy (NS) Hurt by High Long-Term DebtThe Zacks analyst believes that NuStar Energy's high long-term debt of $3.3 billion is a concern, as it restricts the partnership's financial freedom to tap into growth opportunities.High SG&amp;A Costs and Capex to Clip Advance Auto's (AAP) FCFAdvance Auto's rising SG&amp;A costs and capex, needed to support its store expansion efforts, are likely to weigh on its margins and free cash flow, per the Zacks analyst.NVIDIA (NVDA) Hurt by Weakening Demand, High Inventory LevelPer the Zacks analyst, NVIDIA is hurt by weakening demand for its chips across the gaming and data center end-markets.

The 8th most populous state in the country, Georgia is one of only 15 states with a AAA rating. It is home to many major companies some of which are the biggest companies in the world in their own industries. The state is also home to the busiest airport in the world in Atlanta both in terms of aircraft traffic and passenger traffic in the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport while it is also home to one of the biggest seaports in North America.25 biggest Georgia companies and stocksCopyright: sepavo / 123RF Stock PhotoAtlanta, the capital of Georgia, is one of the most important global cities in the world not just because of having the biggest airport but being home to many major industries which include finance, insurance, technology, real estate manufacturing, logistics and communications. The biggest producer of pecans in the world, Georgia is home to a major agricultural industry and is among the biggest blueberry producers in the country too.In the last one year, Georgia has seen its unemployment rate decline by 0.3%, from 3.3% in November 2021 to 3% in November 2022 which is the 14th best rate for any state. However, even this is not as good as the 2.8% that the state reached for three straight months but with a recession imminent, a slight increase shouldn't be seen as something outlier. Before the pandemic struck, Georgia's unemployment rate was at a historic low of 3.1% before climbing to 12.6% in just two months when the effect of the pandemic was fully felt. Clawing this back to 3% shows the progress the state has made in recovering from the pandemic which should help it navigate economic headwinds heading into 2023.Story continuesTo encourage businesses and their growth in Georgia, which includes various tax credits that allow you to reduce tax credits and is considered to be the first state in the Southeast to use single-factor appointment, which means that the corporate tax rate will be calculated only based on sales made inside Georgia.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Massachusetts would be 32nd largest economy in the world based on a 2021 GDP of $641 billion, which makes it bigger than Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Austria. The economy of Massachusetts is strongly based on technological research and development as well as the service sector, which dictates a major switch from its preindustrial economy which was largely dependent on agriculture and maritime trade. That is not to say that agriculture isn't an important contributor as it definitely is; it's just that it isn't as significant to the state's economy as it used to be. The pharmaceutical industry has a major presence in the state as well and several of the biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks are pharma / biotech companies.Education has always been considered important in Massachusetts and this should come as no surprise considering the fact that the oldest and one of the most prestigious ranked universities in Harvard University is located in the state. In addition, the state is considered to be a pioneer in kindergarten and secondary education as well, and this historic focus on education is no double linked to the success of the state in various metrics including being among the biggest states in the country.25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocksMarcio Jose Bastos Silva/Shutterstock.comIn November 2022, the unemployment rate of Massachusetts was 3.4%, which ranks it 22nd among all U.S. states. According to Boston Indicators, Massachusetts started to drop into recession after the Covid-19 pandemic hit but posted a quick and strong recovery which was needed after unemployment increased to a record 16% in April 2020. Even in 2022, the unemployment rate has continued to drop as it was 3.9% in 2021, and over half a million jobs have been regained since 2020. However, there are still challenges remaining relating to unemployment which includes an outflux of workers, and higher unemployment for minorities.Story continuesRight now, Massachusetts is moving more slowly than other New England states as the aforementioned labor outflux has exacerbated labor supply issues while higher interest rates have negatively impacted high growth companies such as tech and research and development, which we mentioned were the main sectors in the state. On the other hand, the professional services sector, which employs the highest number of people in the state, has posted a strong recovery in 2022.To encourage growth of businesses, Massachusetts provides several tax and other benefits including tax credits for cleaning up contaminated property, credits for investing in housing development projects, tax credits for taxpayers and businesses which make cash contributions to investment projects, and the Economic Development Incentive Program Credit to create and stimulate business within Massachusetts.The 25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks have a combined revenue of $486 billion and a market cap exceeding $1.22 trillion with three companies worth more than $100 billion headquartered in the state. To determine these companies, we obtained the 25 largest companies in the state from Fortune 500 based on revenue and determined their market cap from Yahoo finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap, and where the company wasn't listed, assigned it a ranking based on revenue alone.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.State Street Corporation in FocusState Street Corporation (STT) is headquartered in Boston, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 19.29% since the start of the year. The company is paying out a dividend of $0.63 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.72% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.06% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.58%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.52 is up 5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, State Street Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.44%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. State Street Corporation's current payout ratio is 34%, meaning it paid out 34% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for STT for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.53 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 15.11%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that STT is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Minnesota Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Minnesota would be the 53rd biggest economy in the world with a GDP of $412 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This means that the state's GDP is bigger than Egypt, Denmark and Singapore. 27 companies headquartered in Minnesota are in the Fortune 500. Currently, Minnesota is a major contributor to agriculture in the U.S. and is the country's biggest producer of green peas, sweet corn and sugar beets and is home to major food processing companies which then turn crops into the finished product.While Minnesota's economy has evolved, some industries which have dominated the last couple of centuries are still important contributors to the economy of the the state such as forestry. Further, even though iron ores are mostly depleted in a state which produced a large portion of total iron production in the world, taconite mining is still an important contributor to Minnesota's economy. Retail is another industry which has maintained a strong presence and some of the most popular retail chains in addition to being among the biggest retailers in the country, with thousands of locations maintained across the country.25 biggest Minnesota companies and stocksPixabay/Public DomainIn June 2022, Minnesota's unemployment rate was just 1.8%, among the best in the country but it has declined in the last six months and in November 2022, unemployment in the state increased to 2.3%, though it is still the second lowest unemployment rate in the country right now, with only Utah outperforming Minnesota in this measure. Despite the slight increase in the past 6 months, there shouldn't really be a major cause for concern since the unemployment rate has been historically low and is still well below the average. Whether this continues in 2023 amid a recession still remains to be seen. According to DEED commissioner Steve Grove stated that Minnesota's economy has grown much faster than most other states in 2022 and has seen fourteen straight months of jobs growth while its labor participation rate being 67.9% in November.Story continuesTo attract businesses to the state, Minnesota provides various incentives, grants and tax credits which could change the composition of the biggest Minnesota companies and stocks in the future. The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development provides various such incentives including angel tax credit schemes, Urban Initiative Loan Program, Minnesota Job Creation Funding, Small Business Administration Financing Programs, Indian Business Loan Program and State Small Business Credit Initiative.

Global nitrogen demand is expected to have remained strong, driven by higher commodity futures prices and high levels of planted acres in North America in the fourth quarter. High agricultural production in India and Brazil is expected to have boosted urea demand in the fourth quarter.The company is also likely to have gained from higher nitrogen prices on the back of lower supply resulting from reduced operating rates globally due to higher energy prices. Higher nitrogen prices are likely to have aided the company’s sales and margins in the quarter.However, higher natural gas costs, partly stemming from elevated natural gas costs in Europe, are likely to have increased the cost of sales and affected the company’s margins in the fourth quarter.Story continuesCF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Things in that department probably won't get better anytime soon, and what's worse -- we're likely on the brink of a global recession. We need relief, and for many of us, that will come, at least in part, in the form of discounts on retail goods.Check Out: 9 Dollar Tree Items To Stock Up On This SummerImportant: 7 Things You Should Never Do When Planning for RetirementEnter Walmart, which is diving into August with a big splash of sales. Shoppers can find prices slashed on a variety of products -- from summer essentials like grills to back-to-school must-haves. GOBankingRates consulted deals experts to learn about 10 of the biggest deals at Walmart in August. Let's have a look.SolStock / Getty ImagesDorm Furniture""August is also off to college time, and for incoming freshmen that can mean having to buy dorm essentials for their first year away from home,"" said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. ""Fortunately, Walmart will have you covered with things like mini fridges for under $100 that will be perfect for stowing in dorm rooms and holding drinks and snacks, as well as 3-drawer plastic carts with wheels to help keep things organized.""Take Our Poll: Do You Tip for Service?united photo studio / Shutterstock.comCookwareYou'll also find affordable cookware sets, such as an 18-piece set from Tramontina for around $45, reusable stainless steel water bottles for less than $20 and even affordable furniture to make things a little cozier.For perspective, a set of Tramontina cookware goes for $300 at Williams Sonoma.Suwanb / iStock.comLuggage""If your student is headed off to college, it may be a good time to pick up some new luggage to help them ferry items more efficiently,"" Ramhold said. ""Even if they aren't getting on a plane, roller luggage may be a good investment and you can find smaller duffel suitcases for around $25 at Walmart, and 3-piece sets for as little as $35 as well.""Story continuesLuggage is infamously pricey. Duffel suitcases sell for as much as $300 at Target, while 3-piece sets easily cost over $100.Inside Creative House / Getty Images/iStockphotoTech""Tech deals will include things like printers, Google Chromecast and noise-canceling headphones,"" Ramhold said. ""Walmart already offers these items at great prices, but during the month of August, you'll likely see better discounts.""Right now, printers at Walmart go for an average of $100 or so, Google Chromecast costs $40 and noise-canceling headphones retail for as much as $300, so any sales here will be quite refreshing.mediaphotos / iStock.comGrills""[At Walmart], the savings for grills will likely be better than what we've seen thus far this summer,"" Ramhold said. ""This is an item that demand will be somewhat decreasing for, even though football season is on the horizon and the tailgate parties that come with it, so it'll be a good time to pick up your preferred method of cooking for less.""AlenaMozhjer / Getty Images/iStockphotoSummer Clothing""There are already fashion clearance deals under $15, and those are only expected to get better during August,"" Ramhold said.Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock.comCooling Products (Perfect for Heatwaves)""This isn't a guarantee, especially with much of the country still dealing with a heatwave, but there's a chance that we'll see decent discounts on fans, air conditioners and similar items during August,"" Ramhold said. ""Even with hotter temperatures and a higher demand, these items are still definitely part of the summer-specific category. Because of that, the demand should be winding down, especially as shoppers have likely already purchased these items since the heat waves have been a concern thus far, so discounts in August may be more likely than expected.""Tupungato / Shutterstock.comWalmart's Summer Clearance Sale""Walmart has savings on thousands of items from all product categories right now,"" said BlackFriday.com shopping expert Mackenzie Shand.

Walmart is Edgewell's biggest customer.""(Walmart) said to us, 'From here, our consumer is challenged, we're going to be looking out for consumers, so you're going to have to have really good reasons if you're going to price up from here,"" Little said in an interview.""Because the consumer is now under more pressure, and Walmart is under pressure, that sets up a dynamic where there's probably not a lot of pricing going forward.""Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.Story continuesAt Unilever, the purveyor of Dove soap, Knorr bullion cubes and Hellmann's mayonnaise, finance chief Graeme Pitkethly said Thursday that it was ""not yet past peak pricing,"" even after implementing a record 13.3% average price hike in the fourth quarter of 2022. Unilever estimated net material inflation of $1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in the first half of this year.Procter &amp; Gamble, maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, said on January 19 it would continue to raise prices despite seeing a drop in volumes. It sells more than $10 billion worth of products through Walmart.Rubbermaid-maker Newell Brands said Friday that it would increase some prices, though it expects commodity and transportation costs to fall. Fifteen percent of Newell's sales go to Walmart, according to its regulatory filings.To be sure, Walmart has the upper hand. Its own store brands, Great Value and Equate, compete directly with Unilever's and P&amp;G's product lines in the United States. Forty-three percent of all purchases of store brand packaged goods made online in the U.S. were on Walmart.com, according to the research firm Numerator, which measured transactions for the last quarter of 2022.The clout Walmart holds over suppliers also means that Walmart would likely get the lowest percentage of any price hikes manufacturers implement, according to investors who track the company. ""Walmart is just a conduit (for P&amp;G and Unilever) that uses its enormous size to provide the best deals it can for customers,"" said David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank.""We would think Walmart might emerge with less of a consumer goodwill hit than these other companies in a rising-price environment,"" said Kilnk, whose firm holds more than $45 million in Walmart shares.Walmart previously has stopped ordering products over disputes on pricing.In 2018, Walmart pulled back on ordering Campbell Soup Co's products during the key winter season over a dispute over prices and shelf space promotion.Across the pond, tussles between Britain's largest supermarket chain Tesco and Kraft Heinz led to Heinz baked beans being removed from shelves. At the time, Tesco labeled Heinz's price hikes as ""unjustifiable.""Huggies diaper maker Kimberly-Clark said it was embedding additional pricing this year, while toothpaste maker Colgate said it planned further price hikes in the first half of 2023.""We're trying to figure out with our (dry grocery and consumables) suppliers, what could we do that's different that would help mitigate some of those costs?"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at an investor conference in December.""Unfortunately, some of those suppliers are still pointing us towards more inflation next year on top of the mid-double digits this year. And we don't like that for any reason,"" he said.Shoppers at chains such as Walmart and Kroger were waiting longer to buy new products like bleach and kitty litter, and in some cases trading down to buy smaller sizes, or larger wholesale quantities because they want more value per unit, Clorox's CFO Kevin Jacobsen said February 2.After raising prices four times in 2022, he said, Clorox doesn't ""have any additional plans"" to hike prices this year.

The average household now spends about $200 per month on subscriptions, and 72% of Americans think there are too many subscriptions, according to Telemedia Online. Add soaring inflation to the mix, and it’s easy to see why people are trying to cut as many subscriptions as possible.Costco’s Best Deals? Employee Reveals 10 Standout Buys for Your MoneySee: 3 Signs You’re Serious About Raising Your Credit ScoreThat is perfectly understandable, but not all subscriptions are the same. While many are purely for entertainment or send us things we don’t need, others provide the essentials. At the same time, they bundle things we would have purchased with or without a subscription in the process. In other cases, they are cheaper than similar items you might buy at a store.It can be hard to believe, but it’s absolutely true. This list includes some of the best subscriptions out there that will actually save you money.Amazon PrimeDepending on how you use it, Amazon Prime can save you a good bit of cash every year. That’s because it includes free one-day or even same-day delivery. Plus, you get access to Prime Video and Prime Music — the latter lets you listen to both music and podcasts ad-free.There’s also two-hour grocery delivery and discounts of up to 80% on prescription medications.

There are also discounted rates of $7.49 per month for students and $6.99 per month if you qualify for government assistance.Dollar Shave ClubIf you shave with razor blade cartridges, you might be spending more than necessary.

For instance, a four-pack of Club Series Blades will cost $8.50, and a six-pack is just $10. With Dollar Shave Club, there’s no membership fee — you only pay for the products you order.Story continuesTake Our Poll: Do You Have a Second Job or Backup Plan in Case You Are Laid Off?Imperfect FoodsYou may have heard of Imperfect Foods — the subscription service will send you “ugly” fruits and vegetables at a discount. The average box costs between $11 and $43 for conventional produce and between $15 and $45 for organic produce.If you regularly spend more than that on produce every week, this could be a big money saver. In addition to produce, Imperfect Foods has other kinds of boxes, like dairy packs for $9.99 per week and meat &amp; fish packs for the same price.Nike Training ClubStaying in shape has many benefits that can pay off for your health and perhaps financially too. Unfortunately, the upfront cost of gym memberships and workout equipment can be quite high.Nike Training Club could be a great option if you want to exercise without breaking the bank. The free app has dozens of trainer-led workouts of varying skill and intensity levels.PhiloTV can be an enormous expense, with the average cable plan running upwards of $200. Some cord-cutters have opted to forego live TV completely and instead pair an HD antenna with services like Hulu and Netflix.But if you must have access to live TV, Philo can be a much cheaper alternative than cable. It costs just $25 per month and includes 70+ channels like AMC, BET, Comedy Central, and MTV. Depending on the channel, you can also add movie channels for $3, $6, or $9 per month. Philo also has a 7-day free trial.QuipBrushing your teeth might sound simple, but that doesn’t mean any old toothbrush will do. Quip says it provides “better oral care made simple.” Its products certainly look sleek, but that isn’t exactly our concern here. Of course, we want to save some cash.When you start with Quip, you can buy an electric toothbrush (plus a free tube of toothpaste) for $40. That might seem steep, but once you pay the upfront cost, you pay just $5 every three months for a refill. That includes a brush head and a free battery, mint gum and toothpaste.Walmart+Walmart is already known for its low prices, so you may not realize a Walmart+ subscription can save you even more. It’s true, though — if you shop at Walmart often enough, a subscription can more than pay for itself.A subscription to Walmart+ will cost $12.95 per month. That will get you free shipping on Walmart purchases with no order minimums. Plus, you get free delivery for groceries on orders of over $35. It also includes free streaming of Paramount+ and savings of up to 10 cents per gallon on gas. It’s easy to see how this could be a big money saver for the right customer.More From GOBankingRates10 Best New Items Coming to Dollar Tree in 2023Make the Most of Your Bank and Your MoneyBuild Your Credit Score with These Simple Strategies8 Steps To Improve Your Finances in One YearThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Subscriptions That Will Actually Save You Money]"

18,66b3c3d9-479b-30bb-a468-d12c4d81160d,WMT,2023-02-11,Walmart pushes back as major product suppliers ask for higher prices,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-pushes-back-major-product-140939470.html,1676038179,STORY,['WMT'],"[By Siddharth Cavale and Jessica DiNapoliNEW YORK (Reuters) -Walmart Inc is warning major packaged goods makers that it can no longer stomach their price hikes, pitching its own private-label products to shoppers as less-expensive alternatives to suppliers' name-brand goods.For the world's biggest retailer, which reports earnings Feb. 21, any increase in prices --- even by just a few cents -- can have negative effects, prompting some shoppers to look for bargains at dollar stores or warehouse chains such Costco.Walmart, which touts its ""Everyday Low Price"" policy, raised prices last year on milk, frozen meals and Tide detergent, to name a few, as its suppliers battled soaring costs of everything from chemicals to wheat and fuel.But now with the cost of cardboard cases declining by 40-50%, the cost of transportation falling by 25-30% and the cost of raw materials declining significantly, ""retailers like Walmart will say 'hey you already had three rounds of price hikes last year, why are you giving us another?'"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.Rod Little, CEO of Schick razor maker Edgewell Personal Care Co, told Reuters that it ""will be very difficult"" to pass new price increases through to retailers going forward. Walmart is Edgewell's biggest customer.""(Walmart) said to us, 'From here, our consumer is challenged, we're going to be looking out for consumers, so you're going to have to have really good reasons if you're going to price up from here,"" Little said in an interview.""Because the consumer is now under more pressure, and Walmart is under pressure, that sets up a dynamic where there's probably not a lot of pricing going forward.""Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.At Unilever, the purveyor of Dove soap, Knorr bullion cubes and Hellmann's mayonnaise, finance chief Graeme Pitkethly saidThursday that it was ""not yet past peak pricing,"" even after implementing a record 13.3% average price hike in the fourth quarter of 2022. Unilever estimated net material inflation of $1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in the first half of this year.Story continuesProcter &amp; Gamble, maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, said on January 19 it would continue to raise prices despite seeing a drop in volumes. It sells more than $10 billion worth of products through Walmart.Rubbermaid-maker Newell Brands said Friday that it would increase some prices, though it expects commodity and transportation costs to fall. Fifteen percent of Newell's sales go to Walmart, according to its regulatory filings.To be sure, Walmart has the upper hand. Its own store brands, Great Value and Equate, compete directly with Unilever's and P&amp;G's product lines in the United States. Forty-three percent of all purchases of store brand packaged goods made online in the U.S. were on Walmart.com, according to the research firm Numerator, which measured transactions for the last quarter of 2022.The clout Walmart holds over suppliers also means that Walmart would likely get the lowest percentage of any price hikes manufacturers implement, according to investors who track the company. ""Walmart is just a conduit (for P&amp;G and Unilever) that uses its enormous size to provide the best deals it can for customers,"" said David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank.""We would think Walmart might emerge with less of a consumer goodwill hit than these other companies in a rising-price environment,"" said Kilnk, whose firm holds more than $45 million in Walmart shares.Walmart previously has stopped ordering products over disputes on pricing.In 2018, Walmart pulled back on ordering Campbell Soup Co's products during the key winter season over a dispute over prices and shelf space promotion.Across the pond, tussles between Britain's largest supermarket chain Tesco and Kraft Heinz led to Heinz baked beans being removed from shelves. At the time, Tesco labeled Heinz's price hikes as ""unjustifiable.""Huggies diaper maker Kimberly-Clark said it was embedding additional pricing this year, while toothpaste maker Colgate said it planned further price hikes in the first half of 2023.""We're trying to figure out with our (dry grocery and consumables) suppliers, what could we do that's different that would help mitigate some of those costs?"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at an investor conference in December.""Unfortunately, some of those suppliers are still pointing us towards more inflation next year on top of the mid-double digits this year. And we don't like that for any reason,"" he said.Shoppers at chains such as Walmart and Kroger were waiting longer to buy new products like bleach and kitty litter, and in some cases trading down to buy smaller sizes, or larger wholesale quantities because they want more value per unit, Clorox's CFO Kevin Jacobsen said February 2. [L4N34I3VL]After raising prices four times in 2022, he said, Clorox doesn't ""have any additional plans"" to hike prices this year.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale and Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including SAP SE (SAP), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) and TC Energy Corp. (TRP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of SAP have declined -1.4% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s decline of -9.7%. The company’s performance is affected due to continued softness in software licenses and the support business segment, coupled with supply chain constraints, global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability. Also, increasing research &amp; development and sales &amp; marketing expenses to cope with intensifying competition in the cloud space are concerns.However, SAP’s Q1 performance benefited from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new ""Rise with SAP"" solution) across all regions. There is momentum in SAP’s business technology platform, particularly the S/4HANA solutions.The company’s restructuring plan is expected to better align its operating models and go-to-market approach with its accelerated cloud transformation. Frequent product launches like SAP Build and strategic collaborations bode well.(You can read the full research report on SAP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Northrop Grumman’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. -8.1%). The company continues to witness strong demand for its products, driven by programs like F-35, Triton and SABR radar Global Hawk. Solid U.S. budgetary provisions make the analyst confident about a solid contract inflow from the Pentagon. Northrop also holds a strong solvency position.However, a comparative analysis of the stock’s trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture. The prolonged impact of COVID-19 may cause extended disruptions in its supply chain. High inflation rates across the U.S. might also hurt the stock. It expects further impacts related to the conflict in Ukraine and economic sanctions imposed on Russia.(You can read the full research report on Northrop Grumman here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Calgary, Alberta-based TC Energy have underperformed the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry over the past year (-22.1% vs. +4.0%). The company is witnessing continued timing and cost overrun issues over large construction projects, plus the cancellation of Keystone XL, are major overhangs.Story continuesMoreover, further share price appreciation will likely be tied to the progress on its debt reduction front, which sits at a massive C$40.92 billion. Therefore, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.Nevertheless, TC Energy is predominantly a natural gas pipeline operator, with operations spanning Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. A quality stock with industry-leading wide-moat assets, TC Energy has a secured portfolio of C$34 billion in growth projects.This should support the company’s stated dividend growth commitment of 3-5% annually in the future. TC Energy’s takeover of its TC Pipelines unit last year has helped it to improve corporate governance and lower the cost of capital.(You can read the full research report on TC Energy here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Nucor Corp.

I will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.Bill Hornbuckle : Thank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm proud to announce that MGM Resorts International drove record fourth quarter adjusted property EBITDAR for Las Vegas and regional resorts. What's more, our full year Las Vegas Strip adjusted property EBITDAR increased by more than 80% year-over-year. These outstanding results are evidence of our focus on optimizing growth in our business and operations as well as our strategic vision of becoming the world's premier gaming entertainment company. These outcomes are also a testament to our employees who will go above and beyond every day to take care of our guests and create an amazing, great experiences, which drive loyalty among our customers. Our employees are true heroes of this story, and we need to be celebrated.Story continuesI couldn't be proud of them for delivering these financial results alongside the steady improving guest and record employee satisfaction scores we are enjoying. As we look forward, we expect many of the drivers for our 2022 performance to continue into 2023. Importantly, we are well positioned on weathering a variety of environments, given the inherent long-term benefits of MGM's diverse portfolio. In fact, we have the most diverse offerings in the gaming space. And as such, we are a well-balanced organization that benefits from both scale and a host of premier brand offerings. This distinction -- the distinct pieces of our business that creates this diversification are number one, our number of nine Las Vegas Strip and eight regional domestic properties in the U.S. that cater to all market segments and produced consistently strong profitability; two, our two integrated resorts in Macau, the pre-pandemic generated EBITDAR of over $700 million and are just now beginning to see a very real return to profitability; three, our digital strategy with 50% ownership of BetMGM, one of the leading U.S. digital sports betting and gaming operators.BetMGM is the leader in what is financially the most important segment in the nation, iGaming, and is making overall progress towards its profitability. And our ownership of LeoVegas, which we're using to grow our digital business internationally and extend both MGM's brand and content reach. And ultimately, our balance sheet, allowing significant flexibility to invest in areas with the highest return on capital including New York, Japan, further expanding our digital footprint via LeoVegas and other substantive international opportunities we're pursuing in that space as well as funding and continued share repurchases. In fact, as you know, we have just announced that our Board approved another $2 billion repurchase program. Looking ahead, we see multiple opportunities for growth and momentum in our business, coupling these opportunities with a relentless focus on free cash flow per share, our operating model, our margin control and disciplined expense management, which we believe gives us a great confidence that our best days are ahead of us.Let me walk through the business case for '23, starting with our U.S. properties. First, we are encouraged by the early success of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas as we migrate the business into MGM Resorts infrastructure. On an annualized basis, we have double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDAR compared to the reported 12-month period prior to the acquisition. We are already beginning to produce cross-property play with hundreds of high-end players from The Cosmopolitan database attending MGM Resorts customer events and driving millions and win at our other sister properties. This is a trend that we saw continued for the Lunar New Year celebration at our properties in Las Vegas, and we expect to expand to the mass market as we integrate MGM Rewards into The Cosmopolitan system.Next, we have a strong event calendar in Las Vegas. CES has a 115,000 attendees last month, up from 45,000 in 2022. CONEXPO and CON/AGG next month is setting up to be the best ever. And March Madness, Sweet Sixteen and the Elite 8 games are coming to Las Vegas. Together, the calendar in March is positioned to have us have the best hotel revenue month, we believe, in our history. Additionally, Formula 1 is expected to bring $1 billion in economic value to the city, which we believe we are the best positioned to take advantage of. Las Vegas also has Allegiant Stadium, which has brought 40 events and over 1.5 million visitors to Las Vegas in 2022 and is expected to bring even more visitors, even higher quality events in 2023, driving significant spend, particularly at our South end properties.Another tailwind is the ongoing growth in visitation. The LVCVA expects domestic flight growth capacity to reach 120% of 2019 in the first quarter of 2023, and international recover further with 80% of 2019 available seats. Harry Reid Airport hosted a record 52.6 million passengers in 2022. Outside of our domestic business, we also see tremendous opportunities for growth. Starting with China, fully stated Macau is back. As you well know, COVID restrictions impacted our Macau operations in 2022, causing an operational loss that negatively impacted our overall results. But we are experiencing a rebound in 2023 as our guests are returning in force just that they did in Las Vegas when restrictions were lifted here. In fact, quarter-to-date, we are excited to report that MGM China's combined properties are the highest earning businesses within our company.As part of the concession renewal process, we committed to bring nongaming entertainment events to Macau. Those events were strong drivers to visitation to our property during the Lunar New Year and at the end of January. We see these early results as validation and our confidence in Macau markets recovery and the long-term viability upon which we are retendering commitments were built. And unique to MGM China, we have secured 200 additional tables as part of our new gaming concession, which combined with our premier mass positioning, should allow us to drive market share into low to mid-teens. In fact, during the month of January, our market share was 16%, which compares to high single-digit market shares pre-pandemic. This outstanding performance was driven by the MGM Chinese team, strategic focus delivering full gaming floor renovation, a complete hotel product mix for our targeted customers various marketing efforts in producing strong nongaming events, shows and promotions plus our team's improvement in service levels and operational efficiencies.These collective efforts position us for a long-term growth story in Macau. We've also reason to be optimistic about the growth prospects of our business well into the remainder of this decade, especially in light of the two new gaming licenses that we hope to receive in the near future. We expect to submit our RFA in New York in the first half of this year, and we hope for response in the near future. One advantage we have over the competition in this market is our ability to add tables to our existing casino floor and thus incremental tax revenue for the state almost instantly once approved for license. We expect to spend about two bed in New York inclusive of the license fee. We will fine-tune our program and planning. But right now, we're expecting extensive property improvements such as a significant entertainment offering, new food and beverage opportunities, covered parking and an overall increase in the casino floor space.As you may recall, we also submitted our RFP in Japan for an integrated resort license to operate in Osaka approximately 10 months ago. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for the response from the government, but we are being patient and believe we will hear so soon. MGM Resorts has presented a compelling offer with our partner, ORIX, to develop an integrated resort, which will develop international tourism and growth to that region. We're extremely excited for the ROI opportunity in a market in which we may be the sole operator for some time in the future. Each of the projects I just mentioned are expected to generate returns well above our current free cash flow yield. These are all future capital investment decisions, we weighed upon that same standard.In closing, 2022 was a phenomenal year for MGM Resorts, and we're confident we will see progress into 2023 and beyond. With that, I'll turn this over to Jon for more color on the fourth quarter and the year.MGM Grand, Las Vegasdavid-vives-O7H0w6s9jG0-unsplashJonathan Halkyard : Thanks very much, Bill. Before I dig into the financial results, let me also thank my colleagues here at MGM Resorts for an outstanding quarter and a truly amazing year. I'll now share with you some of the exceptional financial results that we achieved. Las Vegas Strip same-store revenues, and so that's excluding The Cosmopolitan and The Mirage, grew 11% and adjusted property EBITDAR grew 6% in the fourth quarter compared with last year. Fourth quarter occupancy of 91% was up 500 basis points year-over-year and ADR was $260 in the fourth quarter, which grew 30% over last year. Several volume metrics for us set records as well as our Las Vegas slot handle set its seventh consecutive quarterly record in the fourth quarter.Demand in Las Vegas remains strong across all segments, driven by our exceptional entertainment offerings and other customer demand drivers. The strength continued into January, where occupancy was 90% and rooms booked during the month were on record pace with rates up double digits to last year. In the regions, fourth quarter revenues grew 10% and adjusted property EBITDAR grew 3% year-over-year. While EBITDAR was down 1% versus the third quarter, this sequential decline is in line with normal seasonality for the fourth quarter. Importantly, labor expense as a percentage of revenues was flat sequentially and our current headcount remains approximately 20% below 2019 levels, all while we achieved historic highs in NPS and other indicative customer satisfaction.In the fourth quarter, corporate expense, excluding stock compensation, was $113 million, which includes $5 million related to MGM China, global development costs of $6 million and transaction costs of $2 million. Going forward, we expect corporate expense for the full year 2023 to be approximately $380 million to $400 million, a decrease of approximately $30 million to $50 million from 2022. Included in MGM's corporate expense this year is $44 million for MGM China and approximately $37 million in anticipated development expense related to Japan and New York. We intend to invest approximately $800 million in domestic CapEx in 2023, and this compares to the $727 million in CapEx invested in 2022. Maintenance capital will be approximately $600 million of this spend this year.And this year, it includes room remodels in the Bellagio Spa Tower, Borgata's Water Club and the completion of our New York-New York room renovation. Since 2019, we've reduced the average age of our room since renovation by roughly 3.5 years, and our room age will continue to decrease over the coming years as we refresh our room offerings. The remaining CapEx in 2023 is growth capital, projects that include the Mandalay Bay Convention Center remodel, a new pedestrian bridge connecting The Cosmopolitan to Vdara and investments in technology to drive better customer experience, ease and engagement. Finally, on the development front, we expect to contribute $70 million -- $75 million to BetMGM in 2023 and the only material investment in New York this year will be the $500 million license fee, depending upon the timing of the license awards.I'll conclude with just a few comments on our strategy for capital allocation. First and foremost, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet by sustaining adequate liquidity for our enterprise. And as you can see in the presentation that we posted today, we concluded 2022 with $5.3 billion of domestic cash against domestic debt of $4.5 billion. Our resources this year were bolstered by the disposition of The Mirage in December for $850 million in net cash proceeds after tax. Next week, we expect to close on the sale of the Gold Strike in Tunica, which will be in $350 million in net proceeds after tax. Next, we'll prioritize capital investment to deliver the highest return for our shareholders. Our acquisition of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas expanded our reach into the high end of the Las Vegas market.Our acquisition of LeoVegas jump-started our international iGaming strategy. Our new President of Interactive, Gary Fritz and his team are evaluating a number of opportunities in this area, and our shareholders should expect that we'll be deploying more capital to grow the MGM brand internationally in iGaming and in digital content development. And finally, we're going to return capital to shareholders. During 2022, we repurchased 76 million shares for $2.8 billion. Since the beginning of 2021 through yesterday, we've repurchased $124 million for a total of $4.7 billion and have reduced our share count to 375 million shares. And we're not done. As Bill mentioned, our Board of Directors yesterday approved an additional $2 billion share repurchase program.In evaluating our share repurchase strategy, I consider a number of factors, including the liquidity profile of the company as well as the development and M&amp;A opportunities that are before us. But I also consider the free cash flow yield available in our own shares. So as I conclude, consider the following: adjusted property EBITDAR from Las Vegas last year was approximately $3.1 billion and from our regional operations was $1.3 billion. From that, we had adjusted domestic corporate expense of $400 million and cash rent of $1.7 billion on an annualized basis. Consolidated cash interest was $574 million, but that includes $205 million related to MGM China. And cash taxes and domestic CapEx totaled about $750 million. But our company also has significant reservoirs of value that did not contribute cash earnings in 2022.This includes excess cash of over $2.5 billion; our ownership position in MGM China, which yesterday had an approximate value of $2.6 billion; and of course, our stake in BetMGM. It's a lot of numbers, but when taking all of this into account, I see a double-digit yield opportunity in our shares, which is why I see share repurchases as a responsible and accretive use of our capital. Bill, back to you.Bill Hornbuckle : Thanks, Jonathan. I hope the comments that -- you've conveyed the excitement that we all have towards our business this year and ultimately beyond. In all my time with the company, I've never been more excited about our present and future as I am right now. I think we're stronger, more agile, more focused and more determined than ever to win. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.See also 15 Most Progressive Companies in the US and 25 Biggest Companies Headquartered in New York.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Why Microchip Technology (MCHP) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005184.html,1676048405,STORY,['MCHP'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Microchip Technology (MCHP), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Microchip Technology currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if MCHP is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this chipmaker holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor MCHP, shares are up 9.86% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is up 4.93% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.83% compares favorably with the industry's 9.29% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Microchip Technology have increased 15.04% over the past quarter, and have gained 13.29% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 8% and -7.48%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to MCHP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. MCHP is currently averaging 5,076,113 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with MCHP.Over the past two months, 11 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MCHP's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.92 to $5.99 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that MCHP is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Microchip Technology on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Although it is too early to take a decision, market participants have regained confidence on risky assets like equities to some extent after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have rallied 1.7%, 6.3% and 12.6%, respectively.This trend is expected to continue as the rate of inflation and consequently the magnitude of the Fed’s interest rate hike has declined. Buoyed by the early 2023 rally, several stocks have popped. We have selected five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong upside left.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.Story continuesU.S. Economy is CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter’s growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy to expand by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities are the primary reasons the recent for job cuts. Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, the U.S. labor market remains resilient. Nonfarm payrolls in January came in at 517,000 well above the consensus estimate of 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, below the consensus mark of 3.6%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks that have rallied more than 20% year to date.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Global Insurance Companies by Market Cap.Insurance is one of the largest economic sectors in the global economy, with 105 insurers making it to the Forbes Global 2000 List in 2022. According to McKinsey, the pandemic had a substantial impact on the insurance industry: premium growth, which was more than 4% per year between 2010 and 2020, slowed to around 1.2% in 2020. At the same time, profits also declined by 15%.The industry recovered in 2021, with the Allianz Global Insurance reporting that premiums increased by 5.1% worldwide during the year. The sector’s total assets, as reported by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, stood at $44 trillion in 2021 against liabilities of $38 trillion. In 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its impact on oil and gas prices, extreme drought in food-producing parts of the world, and high inflation were all factors that affected consumer decisions about insurance. Although the final numbers are not out yet, Allianz has predicted global insurance premiums to increase by 4.8% in 2022.Biggest Global Insurance Companiesaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashThere are three main segments in the insurance industry: Life, Property and Casualty, and Health.

With a strong corporate fundamental backdrop in place, Texakoma is positioned to take advantage of current market opportunities in the private energy sector.Texakoma's business directives for 2023 focus on increasing its acreage position throughout Texas and Oklahoma. Asset allocation targets will include the acquisition of existing production, undeveloped acreage, and non-operated properties. With a highly skilled geological and engineering staff, decades of experience, strong oilfield relationships, and a strategic focus on directly sourcing potential opportunities, Texakoma has a market advantage over other exploration and production companies.The time is now to capitalize on what direct domestic energy opportunities offer. In a tight supply market where crude oil or natural gas production cannot keep up with global demands, prices will likely increase. JPMorgan has revised its 2023 oil forecast down to $90 per barrel, which is still higher than recent prices of $80 to $85 per barrel. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon calls for more investment in oil and gas, saying, ""We aren't getting this one right. The world needs 100 million barrels effectively of oil and gas every day. And we need it for 10 years.""

Jared Blikre here to break down that move. Jared, what are we seeing?JARED BLIKRE: That's right. Oil-- actually, energy the biggest performing or the greatest performing sector today. It's on the back of WTI crude oil futures. This is a chart going back five days. And this big spike up here is the announcement this morning that Russia is going to be cutting 500,000 barrels a day from its production capacity next month. And that's coming from a level of over 10 million.So we're talking roughly about, what is that, 25% right there. Now, let me take a look at the energy sector. As I said, it's leading today. It's also been leading this week. Let me show you the five-day performance.This is now tech really taking its first dose of medicine this year. And you can see energy outperforming. This reminds me of the last year, because look at this-- energy vastly outperforming everything else. Most of these other green stocks are-- excuse me, ETFs barely green right here.And here's what happened over the last two years. XLE up 100%. So let's move to our energy board and just see what's going on here. Here's what's going on today. Exxon up another 4%. Now, we've had a lot of these-- all the oil majors have released their earnings now, and a common theme is a return of shareholder capital, along with record profits.Let me show you what has gone on with Exxon. And I prepared this last week, but I want to show it once more-- Exxon is raking in record cash. This is a political football right now. And they are number eight on this list here. You can see Apple dominating that list with $122 billion over the last year. That was in 2022.Exxon a bit less than that-- $50 billion less than that, $76. But still, you can see where this is going. Now, let me show you-- let me get back to our heat map here and just talk about some of the other oil majors now. Chevron just announced a buyback of $75 billion.Story continuesIt caused so much controversy that the CEO had to come and say it was overblown. But you take a look at Chevron, it's up 86% over the last two years. If, in fact-- now, here's another thesis-- if, in fact, growth is slowing once again, we're seeing the NASDAQ turn down, guess what? Energy might be outperforming. So I think those are the dynamics in play.Want to keep watching energy. It was a leader last year. And it may be this year again.SEANA SMITH: Certainly very important to keep an eye on. All right, Jared Blikre, thanks so much.]"

Credit and debit card spending was up in January, a growth of about 5% from the numbers that we saw a year ago.So for more on that, we want to bring in Ann Berry founder of Threadneedle Ventures. And Ann, I think a lot of people, when they're trying to figure out whether or not the rally that we've seen since the start of the year, if that's going to continue, hinges on the consumer, the strength of the consumer at this point. What do you think?ANN BERRY: If it does, I'm really nervous because I think there's consumer buoyancy. The way in which the data is being read is really positive. It's the positive spin. Credit card spending's up. You know what it also means? The consumer's taking out more debt. And what I worry about as savings draw down for the rest of this year and that debt load is going up, I don't think it ends very well for the consumer towards the end of this 2023.DAVE BRIGGS: Is there data showing that concern in terms of debt because I mean, yes, to your point, the credit-debit spend is how they're lopping it together, 5.1% increase versus 2.2% the prior month? Aren't the-- isn't the consumer just in better shape than we thought?ANN BERRY: Well, first of all, that number excludes BNPL, right, which is a whole category that no one talks about, which is another form of consumer debt. Small relative to credit card debt--DAVE BRIGGS: Very small and shrinking.ANN BERRY: But it popped over the holiday season. When you looked at holiday spending, it became a little bit more significant. Other kinds of data, record numbers of consumers are tapping their 401(k) right now to pay for medical emergencies and to pay for mortgages. So not every consumer is the same. And I think the hardest-hit, as always, are the ones with very limited savings.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: What about earnings season so far, just given the state of the consumer? I mean, look at consumer staples. We're hearing a bit of a mixed picture just in terms of sometimes consumers are willing to pay those higher prices that companies have raised over the last couple of quarters versus other names, some in the luxury space, that are starting to see a bit of a backlash. People simply aren't spending. What's been your takeaway from earnings season so far?ANN BERRY: Well, it's-- on the consumer side, it's interesting. Luxury really held up as you looked at it over the last couple of years. Two areas tend to do well when the consumer's under pressure, luxury, because the very wealthy tend to be insulated from some of these macro forces, and then value, the Walmarts, the Costcos tend to do very well as-- to do well in these periods.I think we've seen that. I think luxury paring back makes sense. But I think we're going to see value continue to do quite well.DAVE BRIGGS: When you look at a company like Pepsi, we've seen them increase prices beyond the rate of inflation.ANN BERRY: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: And what they're seeing is demand has dropped a little bit. And volume has dropped a little bit. But those price hikes have more than made up for it. So they have no reason to lower prices. What does that mean for the Fed?ANN BERRY: Yeah, I don't think prices are going backwards, by the way. And Chipotle-- it's Chipotle who came out and said, we hiked up prices. They're not going to go up anymore, but they're not coming down either.DAVE BRIGGS: Right.ANN BERRY: And that's important. Inflation is the rate of increase. So I think, as long as we see the increases stop, things can start to stay still. That makes the Fed's life easier. But I don't think we've stopped seeing companies put up their prices yet behind the excuse of ongoing inflation. That cycle's got to break. It's not broken yet.SEANA SMITH: So what does that mean then for equities? Because if you at least look since the start of the year, we've-- we're off to a strong start with the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ. Can we continue that momentum if we don't see substantial improvement in inflation?ANN BERRY: I don't think so because we know-- look, the Fed's been super clear. And I'm actually a little bit confused by what's happened in the market. Jay Powell was super-clear.Rates are going to continue to go up because inflation has not yet come to the point where it needs to come. I just think the sentiment is baked in right now. I think investors are excited to finally see companies come up with plans. Dan Ives just said, here's what was disappointing about Lyft, crickets, there's no strategy. We don't know what execution's going to be.This earnings season, we have seen companies come out with real plans, with concrete paths towards profitability. I think that's why we see a relatively strong market. But I don't understand it in a macro sense.DAVE BRIGGS: In some cases, those plans are being forced by activist investors.ANN BERRY: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: There's been a real increased trend. So we started with Blackwells Capital on Peloton. We had Nelson Peltz who says that is over in regard to Disney. Elliott Management and ThirdPoint with Salesforce, Ryan Cohen with Nordstrom, this is just to mention a few. Is there a common thread here amongst all these activist investor moves we're seeing?ANN BERRY: Well, you've mentioned the ones that have actually affected change. Some of the activists come in. They have change. They don't have change.What's so interesting to me about Disney and now Salesforce, these are businesses with huge amounts of stickiness, with really strong brands, which have historically had pretty good response to their management teams. And yet these activists are coming in and saying, no, we're finding things for you to do.And so what I find interesting about this is they're succeeding in getting change. And it's also raising a broader question of why aren't these teams figuring this out themselves before the activists come in.DAVE BRIGGS: You see the skepticism on my face. And that's because Nelson Peltz.ANN BERRY: Tell me about-- why are you skeptical about Nelson Peltz?DAVE BRIGGS: What did he do there? He didn't affect any change? Bob Iger was going to do this with or without Nelson Peltz.ANN BERRY: How do we know that?DAVE BRIGGS: He took a victory that he had nothing to do with.ANN BERRY: I don't remember--DAVE BRIGGS: He wanted a board seat, and they ignored him. They said, sit over there in the corner.ANN BERRY: I feel the heat. This is great.[LAUGHTER]But when did Bob-- when did Bob Iger specifically come out and say--DAVE BRIGGS: He's been on the job two months.ANN BERRY: But he didn't come out and say, I'm going to take $3 billion of cost out until Nelson Peltz came out and said, here's a specific-- here's what the activists do. And this is what happened with Peloton. Here is a really specific plan with specific actions I want this management team to come up with.Bob Iger came back. I rang the victory lap. I'm a retail-- full disclosure-- shareholder in Disney. When he came back, I was thrilled, right? But he didn't have a plan. He didn't have anything specific until he was, to your point, a little bit of time in the seat.DAVE BRIGGS: You don't think those things were already in motion? You don't think that was Bob Iger's plan? And by the way, the dividend, we don't know how much it is. It was a modest dividend at a later date.ANN BERRY: If what Nelson Peltz did was force communication with the market, so we went from perhaps something is on the come to here's now something specific that we can hang our hat on when it comes to actual earnings forecasts and the outlook, from a shareholder perspective, I like that.DAVE BRIGGS: Sorry to hijack the conversation.SEANA SMITH: I was going to say, how do you look at it, though, from an investor's perspective, right? If there is activist investor involvement, is that an opportunity then, do you think, to get in and buy some of these stocks?ANN BERRY: So it really depends. And to go back to the Disney example because it's so much fun that we get so riled up about it--[LAUGHTER]Here's why I like that situation. Again, it was about specifics. This was the same with Peloton. Here's a very specific plan. It was very analytical. It was very rigorous. And it was very operationally-focused. That I like because then you've got a CEO who's able to respond to something specific.What I don't like as a shareholder is if an activist turns up, makes a bunch of noise, doesn't have something specific to respond to, then that's a distraction for the management team. And that is actually not good for the shareholder. So there are different kinds of approaches.DAVE BRIGGS: So like Ryan Cohen and Alibaba, that one doesn't make any sense to me. You're dealing with the Chinese government. How are you going to enact change?ANN BERRY: Well, in that case-- and I'm not in Alibaba-- that's where I would say that falls in the bucket of saber-rattling. And then it's just going to be one more thing for a CEO to deal with other than creating value.DAVE BRIGGS: I guess I'm just saying, I think Barry McCarthy deserves more credit too in the case of Peloton. He came in. He's been trying everything since starting there, only been on the job about a year.ANN BERRY: Yep.DAVE BRIGGS: I'll stop my rant. But it was a good discussion, a good back-and-forthSEANA SMITH: It was a great discussion.ANN BERRY: But it's a great-- he's a CFO. He's a capital allocator. That's his-- that was his superpower.SEANA SMITH: Well, they certainly are. We're seeing a change at a number of these companies. Ann Berry, always great to have you. Thanks so much for coming in the studio for us.ANN BERRY: Thanks so much for having me on.DAVE BRIGGS: Good to see you.]"

Today, we will discuss our Q4 and year end results, our 2023 outlook, Reinvent SEE 2.0 and our acquisition of Liquibox. After that, we will open up the call for your questions. Starting on Slide 3, the graphic is showing where we are taking packaging with automation, digital and sustainability solutions. We start with our purpose. We are in the business to protect, to solve critical packaging challenges and to make our world better than we found it. This enables our vision to become a world class company, partnering with our customers on automation, digital and sustainability packaging solutions. Moving to Slide 4, we are excited to announce that on February 1, earlier than originally anticipated, we completed our acquisition of Liquibox, a global leader in sustainable packaging for the fluids and liquids industry and the pioneer innovator of bag-in-box solutions.Story continuesFluids and liquids is our fastest growing and highest margin product line within our Cryovac portfolio, is a fast growing, attractive market for us as flexible packaging is disrupting the rigid container market. Liquibox brings to see new competitive capabilities and is highly synergistic with our existing business. The combined Liquibox and Cryovac business in 2023 is expected to exceed $600 million, representing more than 10% of our portfolio. Our plan is to turn the fluids and liquids business into a $1 billion vertical by 2025 with an operating leverage of over 40%. Liquibox will enable us to open significant new opportunities for growth in areas like ready-to-drink liquids, wine and spirits, consumer packaged goods, quick-service restaurants and other attractive spaces as the best suitable and cost-effective alternative to rigid containers.The combined business will leverage upon Cryovac technology for freshness and shelf life extension, broad market access and global footprint. To the question of why now? We have been investing in this attractive space for quite some time. Our team identified Liquibox as a prime target in our M&amp;A pipeline and the most coveted asset in the fluids and liquids space. As the window of opportunity was getting closer, we preempted a potential auction process. We quickly closed the transaction within 3 months, 2 months earlier than originally anticipated. I have appointed Emile Chammas to lead the fluids and liquids vertical, deploying our proprietary integration playbook, delivering on our target revenue ambitions of greater than $1 billion and achieving cost synergies of approximately $30 million before year three.Food processing, processed food, food process, food ingredientsCopyright: wavebreakmediamicro / 123RF Stock PhotoUnder Emile's leadership, SEE's and Liquibox cross-functional teams are highly energized to implement the plans they have been jointly developing. Let's turn to Slide 5, which highlights how we are moving to be a market-driven customer-first company fueled by our iconic brands. Our solutions focus on automation, digital and sustainability create value for our customers by improving their productivity, sustainability and enhancing their competitive advantages while allowing SEE to deliver growth faster than the markets we serve. Our digital online sales have now ramped up to 10% of our total sales in Q4, doubling that from Q3. This digital transformation will be a driving force behind the evolution of our go-to-market strategy and source of new innovation while enabling us to reach more customers effectively and efficiently.Our online sales platform, MySEE empowers us to reach new customers and new geographies for a highly profitable Bubble Wrap inflatable solutions. In the quarter, we converted two of our largest distributors to online partners to make this happen. Our Cryovac's fluids and liquids business grew over 20% in 2022. Now with the addition of Liquibox, we expect this new vertical to be over 10% of our portfolio with a 40% operating leverage. In fresh proteins, we saw retail markets going down in Q4, driven by declining customer spending. Consumers are trading down from premium proteins and customers are working through excess inventory. Leading with SEE automation, we were able to win with major customer conversions. Fulfillment, industrial and especially electronic markets were significantly down in Q4.Destocking amplify this trend. The outlook for these markets is to stay challenged in the first half with a rebound in the second half of 2023. We plan gains from new innovations in automation that were constrained over the past 24 months. Following our investments to double capacity, including our new developments in fiber-based solutions, we are well positioned for growth in the second half of 2023. We are excited about the recent launch of our new line of paper Bubble Wrap mailers and high recycled content Bubble Wrap filler solutions. Moving to Slide 6, following the success of Reinvent SEE, we now advance to the next phase of our transformation with Reinvent SEE 2.0, moving from the best in packaging to a digitally driven world-class automated solutions company.Starting in 2018, Reinvent SEE built and solidified the foundation for the next phase of SEE's journey through development of the SEE operating model and our growth platforms, including leading with automation, digital and sustainability. Reflecting on the last 5 years, we have met or exceeded our operating model targets. Sales growth has compounded at 5% versus our 5% to 7% target. Adjusted EBITDA has been 8% versus our targeted range of 7% to 9%. Adjusted EPS growth has compounded at 18% versus our goal of over 10% and we have averaged 89% free cash flow conversion over the last 3 years. 2022 was challenged on free cash flow with the building of working capital as we fought through supply constraints and volume headwinds. Reinvent SEE 2.0 focuses on high-quality profitable growth and improved productivity.The Liquibox transaction accelerates our growth platforms, highlighting our transformation from product to customer-first solutions approach. Our digital transformation will empower us to attack new areas of opportunity and will drive profitability to accelerating the use of automation in our own operations. By moving the business online, we will focus efforts to grow faster than the markets we serve through a simplified, more digitized organization, reducing our cost structure by $35 million to $45 million over the next 12 to 18 months. Let's now discuss how Reinvent SEE 2.0 will fuel our SEE operating engine. Turning to Slide 7, we have updated the SEE operating model out to 2027 with Reinvent SEE 2.0 targets. On the left side of the slide, we outlined the SEE operating model growth assumptions.In 2023, we expect a flat growth performance despite a 3% market decline. The downturn in the first half will be recovered by a strong second half. Liquibox will add 6% profitable growth to the total SEE for the full year. We are confident our SEE operating engine will convert sales at more than 30% operating leverage, resulting in continued margin expansion. The combination of the SEE operating engine, our high-performance culture, digital transformation, accretive acquisitions and strong free cash flow generation will deliver world class growth and returns in the next 5 years. Let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss Q4 and full year results. In the quarter, on a constant currency basis, net sales were down 4% and adjusted EBITDA was down 7%. Despite the tough environment, we maintained adjusted EBITDA margins above 21%.On a full year basis in constant currency net sales were up 6% and adjusted EBITDA was up 10%. Our margin expanded by 110 basis points, setting a new record in earnings for SEE. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.99 were down 7% compared to a year ago and up 20% for the full year of 2022 on a constant currency basis. Free cash flow through Q4, though disappointing, was a source of cash of $376 million. We continue to invest in our people and our business as we accelerate our journey to world class. Moving to Slide 9, we updated our SEE automation growth plan. Full year 2022 automation sales were up $475 million, up 10% in constant dollars. In Q4, we added a record  in Q4, we had a record quarter with equipment sales up 24% year-over-year, driven by Food Equipment, which was up 30%.We continue to work with our customers to deploy automation solutions that create savings and fast returns by addressing labor shortages, inflation, safety and productivity. Our bookings continue to outpace revenue for 2022 and though supply shortages linger, we expect to deliver double-digit growth in 2023 to achieve revenues greater than $525 million. We are aggressively expanding our SEE automation solutions portfolio and driving faster growth by integrating equipment and technologies like robotics, vision systems, digital printing from our network of strategic suppliers. In 2023, we are expanding our SEE automation solutions and auto bagging, filling and boxing with their respective fiber-based materials. Now, I will turn it over to Chris who will review our financial results in more detail.Christopher Stephens: Thank you, Ted and good morning everyone. Let's start on Slide 10 to review our fourth quarter net sales of $1.4 billion by segment and by region. In constant dollars, net sales were down 4%, with 4% growth in Food, while Protective was down 15%. By region, we grew EMEA by 5%, offset by declines in Americas of 7% and APAC of 3%. In constant dollars, full year net sales were up 6% to $5.6 billion. Food was up 11%, while Protective was essentially flat. By region, we were up 6% in Americas, up 7% in EMEA and up 2% in APAC. On Slide 11, we summarize our Q4 and full year 22 performance, primarily driven by inventory destocking and lower demand in our protective end markets and FX headwinds, we had a challenging fourth quarter with sales down 8% as reported versus Q4 21.However, for the full year, we delivered reported sales growth of 2%. Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $297 million decreased $33 million or 10% compared to last year with margins of 21.1%, down 40 basis points. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew 7% to $1.21 billion with margin expansion of 110 basis points to 21.5%. This performance was driven by positive net price realization, which we define as year-over-year price realization, less inflation on direct material, freight, non-material and labor costs as well as productivity and  as well as productivity gains, which more than offset lower volumes, higher operating costs and unfavorable FX impacts. As it relates to adjusted earnings per diluted share in Q4 of $0.99, our adjusted tax rate was 26.1% compared to 26.2% in the same period last year.On a full year basis, our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.10, with an adjusted tax rate of 25.4% compared to 26.1% in 2021. We had no share repurchase activity in Q4, but repurchased approximately $280 million or 4.5 million shares in 2022. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in Q4 22 was $146.1 million and $147.1 million for the full year. At year end, we had $616 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. Turning to quarterly segment results on Slide 12, starting with Food. In Q4, Food net sales of $874 million were up 4% on an organic basis, which consisted of 7% price realization to help offset inflationary pressures across all cost categories and volume declines of 3%. Food adjusted EBITDA of $202 million in Q4 increased 2% in constant dollars compared to last year with margins at 23.1%, down 20 basis points.Protective Q4 net sales of $532 million were down 14% organically with price realization of 6% being offset by volume declines. We expect market contractions and a negative economic outlook to continue to put pressure across our Protective fulfillment in industrial end markets in the first half of 2023. Protective adjusted EBITDA of $102 million was down 15% in constant dollars in Q4 with margins at 19.2%, only down 10 basis points despite the end-market weakness and customer destocking activity. Looking at Slide 13, we could see full year segment results starting with Food. Food net sales of $3.3 billion were up 11% on an organic basis, which consisted of 13% price realization to help offset inflationary pressures and volume declines of 2% overall.For the year, adjusted EBITDA of $755 million was up 13% in constant dollars with margins of 22.8%, up 70 basis points. Food automation sales for the year, which include equipment, systems, parts and services, account for approximately 8% of segment sales were up high single-digits. Protective net sales of $2.3 billion were up 1% organically with price realization of 12% being offset by volume declines of 11% in the year. Adjusted EBITDA of $466 million was up 9% organically with margins up 20%, up 160 basis points. As for Protective automation sales in the year, which account for approximately 9% of the segment sales, they were up double-digits, fueled by our auto boxing solution. Now, let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 14. Full year free cash flow of $376 million compared to $497 million in the same period a year ago.The $120 million decline was mainly driven by increased inventory, reductions of accounts payable and higher cash taxes, which were partially offset by favorable adjusted EBITDA. With regards to the reduction in accounts payable, we expect this non-structural use of cash in 2022 to benefit 2023 as we monetize working capital to drive growth and de-lever. On Slide 15, we outlined our purpose-driven allocation strategy focused on maximizing value for our shareholders. We maintain a strong balance sheet while driving attractive returns on invested capital and supporting profitable growth initiatives. We capitalize on the strength of our balance sheet by engaging our bank group in Q4 and accessing the bond markets last month to successfully finance the Liquibox acquisition.We expect to delever throughout the year, estimating 3.5x or below by the end of 2023. Let's turn to Slide 16 to review our 2023 outlook. We expect net sales to be in the range of $5.85 billion to $6.1 billion, which at the midpoint assumes mid-single-digit growth on a reported basis and low single-digit growth organic. We expect Liquibox to contribute between $340 million to $360 million in sales in 2023 given 11 months under our ownership. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, which assumes adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 21%. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.80 assuming depreciation and amortization at the midpoint of approximately $275 million, an adjusted effective tax rate between 26% to 27%, net interest expense of approximately $275 million at the midpoint and approximately 146 million average shares outstanding.The lower 2023 adjusted EPS is largely driven by non-operating items such as higher  expense of $0.08 and higher base business interest expense of $0.27. And lastly, we expect 2023 free cash flow in the range of $475 million to $525 million, which implies a free cash flow conversion of greater than 90%. As noted in our earnings release, we have reached a tentative agreement to settle the legacy IRS tax matter related to the Cryovac acquisition from W.R. Grace. Our 2023 free cash flow range excludes any potential cash settlement as a tentative agreement is subject to further review and approval. As it relates to Reinvent 2.0 we plan to include both the costs and the benefits in our adjusted results as we accelerate our digital transformation to drive higher levels of productivity and operating efficiency.As we've highlighted before, in our SEE operating model on Slide 7, our digital transformation will be driving 1% growth over time by broadening our sales reach, making it easier to do business with us and delivering 30 basis point operational efficiency gains. So as we look ahead to 2023, we anticipate continued softness in the first half. We will remain disciplined to drive the necessary actions to preserve our margins and generate strong free cash flow. With the successful integration of Liquibox the strong value creation, we expect this acquisition to have with our Cryovac brand at the midpoint of our 2023 sales guidance, we expect to be in line with our SEE operating model sales target of 5% to 7%. With that, let me now pass the call back to Ted for some closing remarks.Ted Doheny: Thanks, Chris. Before we open up the call for questions, I wanted to share some insights from my travels around the world, as we've increased our face-to-face meetings in the post-COVID environment. I've been able to meet with our employees, our largest customers and see some of our latest automation solutions and action. It was great to see the progress in our own facilities around the world. Our investments in Touchless automation eliminate millions of touches while providing higher quality materials and removing people from harm's web. It's also been uplifting for me to see how embedded we are with our customers and hear firsthand how we help them through incredible challenges in their facilities. It was exciting to see our latest automation solutions in action and hear from our customers how much they value our partnership.Our automation, digital and sustainability focus is driving value with our customers and our internal operations. Finally, I'm really energized by the cultural fit in working relationship with the Liquibox team, as we jointly uncover more opportunities. With that, I will open up the call for questions. Operator, Victor, we would like to open up now for the Q&amp;A session.See also 13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In and 12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

With that, I'll turn the call over to Patrice.Patrice Louvet: Thank you, Corinna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of better-than-expected performance, including through the important holiday season. All three regions contributed positively to revenue growth. And at the same time, we made strong progress on the strategic priorities we outlined last September in our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan. We have multiple levers of growth and a broad lifestyle portfolio of products. Combined with the agility muscle our teams have built over the last several years, this puts us in a position of strength to become the world's leading luxury lifestyle company even amid macro uncertainty. A key element of this strategy is our commitment to brand and product elevation as we have demonstrated over the past five years, and we're doing all this while maintaining flexibility to respond to consumer demand and market dynamics.Story continuesThis translated to another quarter of double-digit AUR growth even as the broader marketplace became more promotional, as anticipated. We also continue to drive a culture of operating and cost discipline, which enabled us to meet our operating margin targets in the period. As our guidance reflected from the start of this fiscal year, the global environment has been choppy. We are encouraged that our core consumer has remained generally resilient, which reflects the growing desirability of our brand. At the same time, we continue to watch our more value-oriented customers and channels carefully. In this environment, we are taking a pragmatic approach to merchandising, pricing and inventory planning. As we navigate ongoing macro uncertainties, we remain steadfast in driving our three strategic pillars of long-term growth and value creation.These are: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few of our third quarter highlights across each of these strategic pillars. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We continue to invest in our most powerful asset, our timeless luxury brand and way of life to inspire and engage our consumers and ultimately, drive lifetime value. We continue to build our brand desirability with consumers while also growing their value perception of our brand. This is enabling us to grow both market share and AUR. In the third quarter, we drove a diverse range of both global and localized brand activations, showcasing the Ralph Lauren lifestyle.We kicked off the quarter with our California Dreaming Fashion Show at the Huntington Library in L.A. This represented our first ever show on the West Coast, where we have historically been underdeveloped and have an opportunity to scale our presence. From there, we launched into holiday with our Gift of Togetherness campaign, featuring friends of the brand like Shalom Harlow and Tyson Beckford. Our local flagship events range from a family-friendly pop-up skating rink in Ginza to live musical performances at Bond Street in London. These campaigns leverage our authentic brand values around family and togetherness combined with unique localized engagement to excite and delight our consumers around the world. For Polo lovers, we offered our 7 Days 7 Drops on our Polo 67 fan app with a limited edition collection of custom-made skis, vintage ski jackets and collectible posters from the RL archive.In Asia, we drove another successful Singles Day event, ranking #2 for men's apparel and #4 for women's apparel on Tmall. The campaign included our first-ever Tmall cat-faced logo collaboration, generating billions of impressions across online and offline channels in China's key cities. And as we continue to lead in gaming and the metaverse, we launched an innovative collaboration with Fortnite, targeted to next-gen consumers with additional exciting partnerships to come for spring and fall '23. Together, these activations are both reengaging existing customers while also attracting younger full-price consumers to our business. In our DTC businesses, we added 1.6 million new consumers this quarter consistent with recent trends. We exceeded 51 million social media followers globally, a high single-digit increase to last year, led by double-digit growth on Instagram.And our online search trends continue to significantly outpace our peers across our top markets globally, driven by our core categories. Moving to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. Across our organization, we are committed to becoming the leading luxury lifestyle company globally. This starts with the work Ralph and our creative teams are doing every day to offer sophisticated, timeless products that meet the needs of our consumers across their modern lifestyles. Ralph Lauren has a unique positioning in the marketplace that has enabled our brands to thrive over 50 years. Our brand stands for much more than a single product or category. It invites our customers to step into their dream of a better life. At the heart of our business is our collection of iconic core products, which represent 70% of sales and remain a consistent driver of our business season after season.Our core products grew high single digits in the third quarter, led by sweaters, seasonal core knits, sweatshirts and suit separates. Our core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include women's, outerwear and our emerging home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low teens in the quarter. Women's represents our single largest long-term opportunity for market share gains and category growth as a company. We are trading her into the brand across categories to drive lifetime value and up to more elevated style with women's AUR up 12% in the third quarter. Highlights from the period included our dedicated head to toe holiday campaigns for both Polo Women's and Lauren, including the expansion of our Polo ID bags in new seasonal fabrications.Other product highlights and special releases this quarter included the official launch of our Polo Originals line, elevating the upper tier of our core brand with high-quality AUR enhancing styles that pay homage to Polo's roots, our exclusive Navy and gold logo collection capsule with influential Japanese retailer BEAMS, and our Fortnite collaboration with core icons featuring the new Llama player logo and our Polo Stadium collection of digital and physical products. Through these dynamic times, we continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to give consumers what they want as their lifestyles evolve. This enables us to flex from stay-at-home sweatshirts to return to work outfits, to wedding dresses and eveningwear. Switching to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem.We continue to invest in our long-term strategy to develop our key city ecosystems around the world in the third quarter with a focus on elevating and connecting all our consumer touch points across every channel. Starting with digital. Third quarter sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, department store dotcom, pure players and social commerce increased high single digits in constant currency. Our Asia digital ecosystem once again delivered the fastest growth globally. This included another strong Singles Day with double-digit new customer acquisition and sales, significantly outperforming our peers even as we grew AUR by 28%. Within our own digital sites, sales grew low double digits globally in the third quarter.As part of our fully connected ecosystems, we also continue to open new physical stores that enable consumers to engage directly with our brands around the world. We opened 55 new stores in concessions, focused on our top cities globally this quarter, with the majority again in Asia, particularly the Chinese Mainland. Our brand momentum and opportunities in China remain strong. We reported third quarter Mainland sales up high single digits in constant currency. This was an encouraging result in light of widespread COVID disruptions following the relaxation of zero COVID policies in the period with over 90% of our stores impacted by foreclosures, reduced trading hours and staffing levels. As our dedicated teams on the ground continue to manage near-term disruptions with agility, we expect the countries reopening to be a net positive as we continue to strengthen our growing presence in this key market.Elsewhere in the region, we continued to drive double-digit constant currency growth across Japan, Korea, Australia and Southeast Asia, where we opened our first Ralph's Coffee experience in Kuala Lumpur this quarter. In addition to our sustained momentum across Asia, we remain bullish on our long-term growth opportunities and ability to strategically drive lifetime value across North America and Europe. In Q3, we opened our largest children's store in the world on Via della Spiga in Milan. Located across from our flagship, we are now able to showcase the full breadth of our luxury lifestyle proposition in this important market. We also launched our first full-price emblematic store in Barcelona, another influential fashion market as we continue to build our connected ecosystems across the region.And finally, touching briefly on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. In the third quarter, we were proud to be recognized on Fast Company's 2022 Brands That Matter list for our collaboration with Morehouse and Spelman Colleges launched last March. This ground-breaking partnership was just one example of our commitment to evolve how we portray the American Dream in the stories we tell and the faces and creators we champion. We were also recognized as one of Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies, moving from #6 last year to #2 this year for our sector. And on the sustainability front, we highlighted our first cradle-to-cradle certified product just a few weeks ago with our luxury gold Cashmere sweater.A first-of-its-kind luxury product to achieve this global standard, this is just one part of our commitment to enable our past and future products to live on responsibly. This sweater is the first of five iconic products that we plan to make C2C certified by 2025. In closing, our strong performance through the first three quarters of the year underscores our consistency and strong execution. This is underpinned by the power of our brand and Ralph Lauren's multiple drivers of long-term sustainable growth and value creation. Ralph and I are proud of our team's continued agility, execution and productivity as we effectively navigate a dynamic global operating environment. Our focus on offense, agility and pragmatism continues to inspire our approach moving forward.Fashion, Brand, Ralph LaurenPhoto by Julia anseele on UnsplashAnd I just want to take a moment to welcome our newest Board member, Wei Zhang, former President of Alibaba Pictures and SVP of Alibaba Group, who joined us this quarter. Her leadership experience across international business development, focusing on China, entertainment, media and corporate social responsibility make her a unique addition to our Board. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.Jane Nielsen: Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We are encouraged by our strong early progress on our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan. We leveraged our multiple strategic drivers and superior operational capabilities to deliver third quarter results ahead of our expectations. We drove another quarter of solid top line growth, with Q3 revenues up 1% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency, above our outlook. All three regions delivered positive revenue growth on both a reported and constant currency basis as well as positive retail comp growth. Operating margin was at the high end of our guidance with strong expense discipline more than offsetting lower-than-expected gross margin. Operating with discipline has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our long-term strategic plan with productivity helping to fuel our investments in sustainable long-term growth.Exiting the quarter, we continue to leverage the strength of our balance sheet, which has served us well through times of uncertainty. We believe our elevated brand, clear strategy and targeted investments combined with our culture of operating discipline and fortress foundation enablers, put us in a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation. Let me take you through our third quarter financial highlights. Total company revenues increased 7% in constant currency, above our low to mid-single-digit outlook, led by double-digit growth in Asia and Europe. Guidance and results included a timing shift with the week between Christmas and New Year's moving back into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year due to the 53rd week in fiscal '22.This benefited this year's Q3 sales by about 130 basis points, which should negatively impact our smaller fourth quarter by an estimated 170 basis points. Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem sales grew high single digits in constant currency and more than 40% on a two-year stack. With our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites, sales grew 10% on top of more than 30% growth last year. We continue to elevate and expand the breadth of our offering online while enhancing the user experience with a rich digital content. We are also driving further improvements in quality of sales with an increase in full price sales penetration and digital margins strongly accretive to our overall profitability in the quarter. Note that the fiscal quarter shift benefited our own digital sales by about 2 points in Q3 and should negatively impact Q4 by about 3 points.We continue to deliver gross margin expansion in constant currency this quarter, consistent with our long-term guidance. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.2%, down 80 basis points to last year on a reported basis, but up 80 basis points in constant currency. The increase was driven by product mix elevation with AUR up 10% on top of 19% growth last year and lower air freight reliance following last year's supply chain disruptions. While we continue to drive our long-term brand elevation strategy, gross margins were below our expectations this holiday driven by: first, targeted outlet promotions in North America to drive conversion with our value-oriented consumers; second, stronger-than-expected post-Christmas sale days, which shifted into the third quarter from Q4 last year; and finally, higher duty costs in Europe.Compared to fiscal '20 pre-pandemic levels, adjusted gross margin was still 300 basis points higher in the third quarter. Our better-than-expected revenues and operating expense discipline in the third quarter also enabled us to deliver operating margins at the top of our guidance range. Adjusted operating margin was 16% on a reported basis and 17.8% in constant currency, representing a 190 basis point constant currency increase to last year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 1%, including a marketing expense decline of 8% over last year's disproportionately back half-weighted spend. Marketing was 7.3% of sales compared to 8.1% in the prior year period. As Patrice mentioned, operational excellence remains a key element of our fortress foundation, and we remain sharply focused on operating expense discipline even as we continue to invest behind our brands and targeted global expansion to drive long-term sustainable growth.Moving to segment performance, starting with North America. Third quarter revenues grew 1% as stronger direct-to-consumer performance more than offset a slight decline in wholesale, as anticipated. The shift of post-Christmas days benefited our performance by about 190 basis points in the quarter. This shift should negatively impact our fourth quarter sales by about 270 basis points. In addition, the absence of last year's 53rd week is expected to negatively impact North America by another 460 basis points in Q4. In North America retail, third quarter comps grew 2% on top of a strong 38% COVID reopening compare last year. While we were encouraged by another quarter of positive comp growth in our full-price stores, this was offset by softer performance in our outlets as anticipated in our guidance.Our outlet AUR was up high single digits, reflecting our ongoing brand and product elevation in the channel. However, we continued to see softness in our value-oriented consumers. We are focused on driving a strong value proposition to the consumer, which includes expanded category assortments, enhanced selling environments and targeted communications. Our fiscal '23 outlook still assumes caution in this channel through the rest of the year. Comps in our owned ralphlauren.com site increased 9% and more than 40% on a two-year stack, driven by strong performance in core product, tailored styles and footwear. Digital AUR increased on continued product mix elevation. In North America wholesale, revenues declined 2% to last year. As we discussed in November, the decline was entirely driven by a customs delay, which resulted in missed Q3 shipment windows, representing about 3 points of negative impact.As expected, we also saw a slowdown in replenishment trends as our partners focus on keeping inventories clean heading into the new year. Outside of this, our positioning in the wholesale channel remains competitively strong. We gained market share across men's, women's and kids in key partners, and our AUR and wholesale grew 10% on continued product elevation. Promotions on our brands at wholesale were largely aligned with our expectations going into the season. Inventories at wholesale are now normalized following last year's supply chain disruption, and we have experienced minimal cancellations to date for spring '23. We still expect wholesale to be up in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, despite our more cautious view on replenishment and our spring '23 inventory buys.Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency. This 13% growth included about 450 basis points of benefit from the post-Christmas timing shift as well as a wholesale allowance benefit recognized in the quarter. We estimate the timing shift will negatively impact the smaller fourth quarter by about 120 basis points in Europe. Q3 European retail comps increased 11% on top of a 55% compare last year. Brick-and-mortar comps also up 11%, benefited from lapping the start of last year's Omicron variant as well as the post-Christmas sales shift into Q3. AUR increased 12% with gains in both brick-and-mortar and digital AUR. Total digital ecosystem grew mid-single digits in the quarter, with low double-digit growth in owned digital commerce and wholesale dotcom more than offsetting softer pure-play results as anticipated.Europe wholesale declined 1% on a reported basis, but grew 11% in constant currency. This was ahead of our expectations, driven by roughly 8 points benefit related to lower-than-anticipated wholesale allowances as well as stronger spring '23 shipments and fill rates, more than offsetting softer reorder trends. Note that our wholesale outlook continues to embed a notable deceleration through Q4 based on challenging compares and macro headwinds. Overall, while our Europe business has performed better than expected through the first 3 quarters of the year, we remain cautious on the remainder of fiscal '23 into fiscal '24, given dynamic macro conditions across the region. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency, a strong result given significant COVID outbreaks in the Chinese Mainland as well as higher infection rates in Japan.Asia retail comps were up 8% with balanced growth across digital commerce and brick-and-mortar stores. By market, third quarter sales in Japan and Korea each increased mid-teens in constant currency. Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia were up more than 25% and 50%, respectively. The Chinese Mainland was up 7%, despite the significant COVID impacts Patrice mentioned, while Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan grew low teens in the quarter. We returned to full operations in the Mainland by mid-January. And while our teams are prepared to manage through further disruptions, we are encouraged by the continued resilience and strength of our consumer and brand momentum in China along with the rest of Asia. Moving on to the balance. Our balance sheet continues to be an important element of our Fortress Foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders even through dynamic times.Through the third quarter, we returned approximately $560 million in the form of our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date. We ended the period with $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory increased 33%, moderating from first half trends as we reduced goods in transit and significantly improved our lead times from last year's global supply chain delays. Inventory growth still reflects earlier timing of receipts, higher product costs and our strategy of product mix elevation. Nevertheless, we still expect to end fiscal '23 with inventory more closely aligned to sales growth. We continue to manage our inventory position fund with the majority still weighted to core and seasonless product.This gives us greater flexibility to adjust future production levels and allocate product to the channels and geographies with the strongest demand. We also continue to make meaningful improvements in transit times as we move through this year. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on the evolving macro environment, including inflationary pressures, disruptions in the global supply chain, COVID-19, foreign currency volatility and the war in the Ukraine. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios, and our guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impacts. For fiscal '23, we are maintaining our full year outlook in constant currency with revenues expected to increase high single digits or about 8% on a 52-week comparable basis.Our outlook continues to assume a challenging consumer backdrop in Europe and North America. We now expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenues by approximately 600 basis points. We expect operating margin of approximately 13.5% to 14% in constant currency compared to our prior outlook of about 14%. This is based on a more modest level of gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as we keep inventories current and align to demand. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 180 basis points. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis last year, both on a reported basis. Gross margin is now expected to be flattish to last year on a constant currency basis.We plan to continue driving stronger AUR and favorable product mix to offset increased product costs. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 150 basis points in fiscal '23. For the fourth quarter, on a 13-week comparable basis, we expect constant currency revenue growth of about mid- to high single digits. On a reported basis, which includes the impact of last year's 53rd week, we expect revenues to be up 1% and 2% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 500 basis points. Our outlook also includes about 170 basis points of negative impact from the week after Christmas shifting into fiscal Q3 from Q4 last year. We expect fourth quarter operating margin of about 5.5% in constant currency.This represents a roughly 190 basis point increase to last year, driven primarily by operating expense leverage as we normalize our cadence of marketing spend versus last year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 160 basis points in the quarter. We expect constant currency gross margins to be about flat in Q4. This implies roughly 50 basis points of expansion on a 13-week comparable basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margin in the quarter by about 140 basis points. We now expect our tax rate in the range of 24% to 25% for the full year and estimate a roughly 29% tax rate for the fourth quarter. Though this could vary widely as Q4 is our smallest quarter and highly dependent on mix and discrete items.And lastly, we now expect capital expenditures in the range of $240 million to $250 million based on the timing of build-out. In closing, our teams around the world are operating with agility and executing strongly, driving continued progress on our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan. This is a testament to the power of our iconic brand that Ralph created over 50 years ago, and the strength of our Fortress Foundation coupled with diversified engines of growth across product categories, geographies and channels.

With Valentine's Day just around the corner, PG&amp;E reminds its customers to make sure metallic balloons are always tied to a weight – as required by California law – and to never release them outdoors.Pacific Gas and Electric Company logo (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)Last year, metallic balloons caused 415 power outages across PG&amp;E's service area in Northern and Central California, disrupting electric service to more than 210,000 homes and businesses. Unlike latex helium balloons, metallic balloons can stay inflated and floating for two to three weeks – posing a hazard to power lines and equipment even days after being released outside.""On Valentine's Day, nothing puts a damper on a romantic evening faster than a widespread power outage. If your February 14 plans include metallic balloons, please keep them tied down with a weight. If they contact our overhead lines they can disrupt electric service to an entire neighborhood, cause significant property damage and potentially result in serious injuries,"" said Jeff Deal, PG&amp;E's Vice President of Electric Distribution Operations.Here's an example of what can happen when metallic balloons hit utility power lines: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqFm52C1n5QIn 2022, PG&amp;E supported a new metallic balloon law that will enhance the safety of PG&amp;E coworkers, customers and hometowns. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 847, which allows Mylar or metallic balloons to be sold in California only if those balloons do not cause electrical faults when contacting overhead distribution lines.The new legislation bans sales of non-compliant celebratory balloons after Jan. 1, 2027. In the meantime, PG&amp;E reminds customers to follow these important safety tips for metallic balloons:Story continues""Look Up and Live!"" – Use caution and avoid celebrating with metallic balloons near overhead electric lines.Make sure helium-filled metallic balloons are securely tied to a weight that is heavy enough to prevent them from floating away. Never remove the weight.When done with balloons, do not release them. Puncture them several times or cut the knot and throw them in the garbage to prevent them from floating away.Do not attempt to retrieve a balloon — or any foreign object — tangled in power lines or inside a substation. There can be risk of electrocution. Instead, leave it alone and call PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5000 to report the problem.Never go near a power line that has fallen to the ground or is dangling in the air. Always assume downed electric lines are energized and extremely dangerous. Stay away, keep others away and immediately call 911 to alert the police and fire departments.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

We start with the Securities and Exchange Commission taking out staking, which is the cryptocurrency practice in which unused tokens earn interest after a fixed period. It's now seeing some action from the SEC. Crypto exchange Kraken no longer offering staking after a $30 million penalty and settlement.Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has spoken out against restrictions on staking via a tweet. Those comments leading to a small rout in shares of the company because there are concerns about staking at Coinbase as well. They fell a lot more yesterday, now down a bit today.Citigroup barred from handling a major muni bond deal in Texas. This after the state's attorney general says the bank discriminates against the firearms industry. The bond deal, which is worth $3.4 billion, will help utility companies recover from a 2021 winter storm. Citigroup is, in fact, the second bank to be barred from the deal. UBS was first barred after the state said that bank boycotted the oil and gas industry.And the corporate pullback in jobs continues. News Corp set to lay off 5% of its staff after reporting lower quarterly revenue. One bright spot is the company's Dow Jones Financial Publishing Unit, which includes publications like ""The Wall Street Journal."" It was the only unit to report a revenue rise. The news the latest in a long list of companies, of course, that have recently cut costs by reducing headcount, including companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Zoom.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Motorola Solutions with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions How Fast Is Motorola Solutions Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, Motorola Solutions has grown EPS by 16% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. On the one hand, Motorola Solutions' EBIT margins fell over the last year, but on the other hand, revenue grew. If EBIT margins are able to stay balanced and this revenue growth continues, then we should see brighter days ahead.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Motorola Solutions' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Motorola Solutions Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Motorola Solutions has a market capitalisation of US$45b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$144m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Motorola Solutions but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Motorola Solutions To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Motorola Solutions is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Still, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Motorola Solutions.Although Motorola Solutions certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

MSI reported strong fourth-quarter 2022 results, driven by the diligent execution of operational plans and healthy growth dynamics backed by solid order trends. Both adjusted earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. In addition, Motorola achieved record fourth-quarter sales and a quarter-ending backlog despite supply chain headwinds, which further exemplified the strength of its portfolio. The company expects this growth momentum to continue in the impending quarters.Net EarningsOn a GAAP basis, net earnings in fourth-quarter 2022 were $589 million or $3.43 per share compared with $401 million or $2.30 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year improvement despite the higher cost of sales was primarily attributable to top-line growth.Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP earnings in the quarter were record high at $618 million or $3.60 per share compared with $497 million or $2.85 in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents.In full-year 2022, GAAP earnings improved to $1,363 million or $7.93 per share from $1,245 million or $7.17 per share in 2021, while non-GAAP earnings were up to $1,780 million or $10.36 per share from $1,589 million or $9.15 per share.Motorola Solutions, Inc.

QuoteRevenuesQuarterly net sales were record high at $2,706 million, up 16.6% year over year, with solid sales in both segments due to growth in North America driven by the strength of its business model and the value of its mission-critical integrated ecosystem. The company witnessed strong demand for video security, command center software and LMR (land mobile radio) services. The top line beat the consensus estimate of $2,535 million. Net sales in 2022 were $9,112 million, up 11.5% year over year.  Region-wise, quarterly revenues were up 17.5% in North America to $1,615 million due to growth in LMR, command center soft and video security products. International revenues were up 14.6% to $808 million, as growth in video security products, LMR and command center software was partially offset by adverse foreign currency impact. Acquisitions contributed $39 million to revenues, while foreign exchange headwinds were $87 million.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceNet sales from Products and Systems Integration increased to $1,810 million from $1,495 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher demand for LMR and video security solutions. The segment’s backlog was up $894 million to $4.9 billion, primarily due to high LMR and video demand in North America and the International markets.Net sales from Software and Services were up 8.6% to $896 million, with solid performance across command center software, LMR and video security services. The segment’s backlog decreased $106 million to $9.4 billion, primarily due to adverse foreign currency impact and its exit from Emergency Services Network business.Other Quarterly DetailsGAAP operating earnings increased to $692 million from $549 million in the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP operating earnings were up to $822 million from $670 million a year ago. The company ended the quarter with a record fourth-quarter backlog of $14.3 billion, up $788 million year over year.Overall GAAP operating margin was 25.6%, up from 23.7%, while non-GAAP operating margin was 30.4% compared with 28.9% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in GAAP operating margin despite higher operating expenses, owing to inflated direct material costs and acquisitions, was due to higher sales.Non-GAAP operating earnings for Products and Systems Integration were up 36% to $514 million for a margin of 28.4%. Non-GAAP operating earnings for Software and Services were $308 million, up 5.5% year over year, for a non-GAAP operating margin of 34.4%.Cash Flow and LiquidityMotorola generated $1,823 million of cash from operating activities in 2022 compared with $1,837 million a year ago. Free cash flow in 2022 was $1,567 million, down from $1,594 million in 2021. The company repurchased $87 million worth of stock during the fourth quarter.

Non-GAAP earnings for 2023 are currently expected in the $11.10-$11.22 per share range on year-over-year revenues of $9.65 billion to $9.7 billion, with a rise in both segments on higher demand.For first-quarter 2023, non-GAAP earnings are expected in the $2.02-$2.07 per share range on year-over-year revenue improvement of 12-13% due to healthy demand trends.Moving ForwardMotorola is poised to gain from disciplined capital deployment and a strong balance sheet position.

Unlike the metaverse which faces huge difficulty in finding real-life application, ChatGPT has suddenly helped us achieve human-computer interaction,"" said Ding Daoshi, an independent internet analyst and former director of Beijing-based consultancy Sootoo. ""The changes it will bring about are more immediate, more direct and way quicker.""OpenAI or ChatGPT itself is not blocked by Chinese authorities but OpenAI does not allow users in mainland China, Hong Kong, Iran, Russia and parts of Africa to sign up.OpenAI told Reuters it is working to make its services more widely available.“While we would like to make our technology available everywhere, conditions in certain countries make it difficult or impossible for us to do so in a way that is consistent with our mission,"" the San Francisco-based firm said in an emailed statement. ""We are currently working to increase the number of locations where we can provide safe and beneficial access to our tools.""Story continuesIn December, Tencent Holdings' WeChat, China's biggest messaging app, shut several ChatGPT-related programmes that had appeared on the network, according to local media reports, but they have continued to spring up.Dozens of bots rigged to ChatGPT technology have emerged on WeChat, with hobbyists using it to make programmes or automated accounts that can interact with users. At least one account charges users a fee of 9.99 yuan ($1.47) to ask 20 questions.Tencent did not respond to Reuters' request for comments.ChatGPT supports Chinese language interaction and is highly capable of conversing in Chinese, which has helped drive its unofficial adoption in the country.Chinese firms also use proxy tools or existing partnerships with Microsoft, which is investing billions of dollars in its OpenAI, to access tools that allow them to embed AI technology into their products.Shenzhen-based Proximai in December introduced a virtual character into its 3D game-like social app who used ChatGPT's underlying tech to converse. Beijing-based entertainment software company Kunlun Tech plans to incorporate ChatGPT in its web browser Opera.SleekFlow, a Tiger Global-backed startup in Hong Kong, said it was integrating the AI into its customer relations messaging tools. ""We have clients all over the world,"" Henson Tsai, SleekFlow's founder said. ""Among other things, ChatGPT does excellent translations, sometimes better than other solutions available on the market.""CENSORSHIPReuters' tests of ChatGPT indicate that the chatbot is not averse to questions that would be sensitive in mainland China. Asked for its thoughts on Chinese President Xi Jinping, for instance, it responded it does not have personal opinions and presented a range of views.But some of its proxy bots on WeChat have blacklisted such terms, according to other Reuters checks, complying with China's heavy censorship of its cyberspace. When asked the same question about Xi on one ChatGPT proxy bot, it responded by saying that the conversation violated rules.To comply with Chinese rules, Proximai's founder Will Duan said his platform would filter information presented to users during their interaction with ChatGPT.Chinese regulators, which last year introduced rules to strengthen governance of ""deepfake"" technology, have not commented on ChatGPT, however, state media this week warned about stock market risks amid a frenzy over local ChatGPT-concept stocks.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the internet regulator, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.""With the regulations released last year, the Chinese government is saying: we already see this technology coming and we want to be ahead of the curve,"" said Rogier Creemers, an assistant professor at Leiden University.""I fully expect the great majority of the AI-generated content to be non-political.""CHINESE RIVALSJoining the buzz have been some of the country's largest tech giants such as Baidu and Alibaba who gave updates this week on AI models they have been working on, prompting their shares to zoom.Baidu said this week it would complete internal testing of its ""Ernie Bot"" in March, a big AI model the search firm has been working on since 2019.On Wednesday, Alibaba said that its research institute Damo Academy was also testing a ChatGPT-style tool.Duan, whose company has been using a Baidu AI chatbot named Plato for natural language processing, said ChatGPT was at least a generation more powerful than China's current NLP solutions, though it was weaker in some areas, such as understanding conversation context.Baidu did not reply to Reuters' request for comments.Access to OpenAI's GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was first launched in 2020, an update of which is the backbone of ChatGPT.Duan said potential long-term compliance risks mean Chinese companies would most likely replace ChatGPT with a local alternative, if they could match the U.S.-developed product's functionality.""So we actually hope that there can be alternative solutions in China which we can directly use... it may handle Chinese even better, and it can also better comply with regulations,"" he said.($1 = 6.7875 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Brenda Goh and Sam Holmes)]"

This week, Google released to testers its own A.I.-assisted search engine called Bard, while Microsoft announced a new version of its own search engine Bing to be powered by a forthcoming large language model similar to ChatGPT and also developed by OpenAI.The technology behind ChatGPT, which enables the chatbot to provide detailed information and write about complex topics, could pave the way for major changes in search engines and in-office apps, and help with everyday tasks.But ChatGPT’s wide range of uses also has people worried about their jobs. The chatbot can write, compose, and problem solve in response to a prompt in a matter of seconds. While it isn’t always accurate, it leaves technical writers, data analysts, and coders nervous about their future.But ChatGPT isn’t yet a risk to our livelihoods, according to Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and tech investor.“Until now, artificial intelligence could read and write, but could not understand the content,” Gates said in a podcast interview with German business news outlet Handelsblatt.ChatGPT, he said, has shown us what A.I. is capable of, and its effect on the workplace will be extremely positive. “This will change the world,” Gates said.Gates added that while A.I. still makes big mistakes, it could nevertheless enhance office work by improving employee efficiency and productivity. “We find ourselves with a tool that can make even white collar type jobs far more efficient—looking at invoices, medical claims, or, you know, writing letters. Reading and writing are now within A.I.’s capabilities and that will have a very broad impact,” he said.Story continuesGates continued: “Think of the time that doctors spend with paperwork; that we should be able to get rid of. Think of doctors who don't know the latest article that maybe they should be aware of; that we can help with.”Gates admitted he is “biased” in favor of A.I., as he continues to do consulting work for Microsoft after stepping down as CEO in 2000. After announcing a $10 billion investment in OpenAI last month, Microsoft is working closely with the startup to develop artificial intelligence products, especially search. The terms of the investment effectively give Microsoft control of OpenAI’s finances until the company begins turning a profit and can pay back the original investment plus interest.Microsoft is preparing to add its ChatGPT-like A.I. to its office products, including Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint. Features to be unveiled in the coming weeks reportedly include using A.I. to suggest email responses and improve writing, with new developments fast-tracked as competitor Google also begins rolling out its A.I. products.Other ways ChatGPT and chatbots like it can improve the workplace include having an A.I. sit in on a company meeting, during which it can bring up relevant or recently revealed information in real time, Gates said. He added that A.I. will continue disrupting the workplace as the technology improves over time.“The progress over the next couple of years to make these things even better will be profound,” he said.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeThe 5 most common mistakes lottery winners makeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $400,000 homeThe Billionaire Tax: how much the ultra wealthy could end up paying under Biden's new plan and what it means for your tax bill]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Minnesota Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Minnesota would be the 53rd biggest economy in the world with a GDP of $412 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This means that the state's GDP is bigger than Egypt, Denmark and Singapore. 27 companies headquartered in Minnesota are in the Fortune 500. Currently, Minnesota is a major contributor to agriculture in the U.S. and is the country's biggest producer of green peas, sweet corn and sugar beets and is home to major food processing companies which then turn crops into the finished product.While Minnesota's economy has evolved, some industries which have dominated the last couple of centuries are still important contributors to the economy of the the state such as forestry. Further, even though iron ores are mostly depleted in a state which produced a large portion of total iron production in the world, taconite mining is still an important contributor to Minnesota's economy. Retail is another industry which has maintained a strong presence and some of the most popular retail chains in addition to being among the biggest retailers in the country, with thousands of locations maintained across the country.25 biggest Minnesota companies and stocksPixabay/Public DomainIn June 2022, Minnesota's unemployment rate was just 1.8%, among the best in the country but it has declined in the last six months and in November 2022, unemployment in the state increased to 2.3%, though it is still the second lowest unemployment rate in the country right now, with only Utah outperforming Minnesota in this measure. Despite the slight increase in the past 6 months, there shouldn't really be a major cause for concern since the unemployment rate has been historically low and is still well below the average. Whether this continues in 2023 amid a recession still remains to be seen. According to DEED commissioner Steve Grove stated that Minnesota's economy has grown much faster than most other states in 2022 and has seen fourteen straight months of jobs growth while its labor participation rate being 67.9% in November.Story continuesTo attract businesses to the state, Minnesota provides various incentives, grants and tax credits which could change the composition of the biggest Minnesota companies and stocks in the future. The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development provides various such incentives including angel tax credit schemes, Urban Initiative Loan Program, Minnesota Job Creation Funding, Small Business Administration Financing Programs, Indian Business Loan Program and State Small Business Credit Initiative.

To skip our industry overview and see the top 5 most valuable cigarette brands in the world, click 5 Most Valuable Cigarette Brands in the World.The global cigarette industry is a multi-billion dollar market that produces and sells tobacco products, mainly cigarettes. With over 1.1 billion smokers in the world and 200 million more who use other tobacco products, cigarette consumption retains its global presence. The world’s largest transnational tobacco companies are known as the Big 4, which include Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI), Japan Tobacco Inc. (TYO:2914), and Imperial Brands PLC (LON:IMB). The China National Tobacco Corporation is the world’s largest producer of cigarettes, but it is a state-owned entity that mostly serves its own domestic market. Together, these companies sell trillions of cigarettes around the world every year.Even though tobacco use is declining in many parts of the world, tobacco companies still sold approximately 5.2 trillion cigarettes in 2020. Additionally, the rising popularity of partying and pub culture among millennials and working-class people has especially fueled the demand for flavored and unflavored cigarettes around the world in recent years.Furthermore, emerging economies such as India and Thailand are seeing a significant increase in cigarette demand as a result of rising youth populations in these countries. Overall, the highest smoking rates are found in Southeast Asia and the Balkan region of Europe. Western European countries and the Americas tend to have lower smoking rates, However, this is not always guaranteed, as Chile turns out to have one of the highest smoking rates in the world. In 2019, there were an estimated 155 million smokers aged between 15 and 24 years – equivalent to 20.1% of young men and 5.0% of young women, globally.Story continuesAccording to a report by GrandViewResearch, the global tobacco market size was valued at $849.9 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.4% from 2022 to 2030. The demand has been sustained by the growing number of smokers in the developing regions of Asia and Africa alongside extensive marketing campaigns run by major companies. According to data provided by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, an estimated $8.9 billion was spent by large companies on marketing smokeless tobacco and cigarettes in the U.S. This amount breaks down to about $22.5 million per day or almost $1 million per hour.Photo by David Trinks on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the 16 most valuable cigarette brands in the world, we sifted through the cigarette brand rankings of a variety of credible media outlets such as Forbes, Insider, New York Magazine, and more.

79,a17035e2-0f85-3c46-b9d9-3ce06c03ea3e,PM,2023-02-11,An Intrinsic Calculation For Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) Suggests It's 34% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-philip-morris-international-140025801.html,1676037625,STORY,['PM'],"[How far off is Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.62bUS$10.3bUS$11.2bUS$11.8bUS$12.3bUS$12.7bUS$13.1bUS$13.4bUS$13.8bUS$14.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.02%Est @ 3.44%Est @ 3.03%Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.54%Est @ 2.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$9.0kUS$9.1kUS$9.2kUS$9.1kUS$8.8kUS$8.5kUS$8.2kUS$7.9kUS$7.6kUS$7.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$85bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$303bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$303b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$157bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$241b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$102, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Philip Morris International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Philip Morris InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next .Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 6.7%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Western Union Western Union's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. But before making this announcement, Western Union's earnings quite easily covered the dividend. The business is returning a large chunk of its cash to shareholders, which means it is not being used to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 28.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 58%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendWestern Union Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.40 total annually to $0.94. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Western Union has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 29% per annum. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Our Thoughts On Western Union's DividendIn summary, we are pleased with the dividend remaining consistent, and we think there is a good chance of this continuing in the future. On the plus side, the dividend looks sustainable by most measures but it is let down by the lack of cash flows. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. To that end, Western Union has 4 warning signs (and 2 which are a bit concerning) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

But three big headlines this week might signal a shift in the mood.In 2022, rising interest rates contributed to a weaker dealmaking environment. To help curb spending and price inflation in the U.S., the Federal Reserve implemented a series of rate hikes, culminating in another half percentage point rise in December that marked the highest level in 15 years. In addition to making debt-based deals more expensive, those actions also raised serious concern among business leaders of an economic recession in the U.S. this year.More from Footwear NewsExclusive: Designer Brands Acquires Keds From Wolverine, Expands Hush Puppies DealWhy Timberland Recruited 6 Creatives to Reimagine the Iconic 6-Inch Boot for Its 50th AnniversaryVF Corp. Stock Rises After-Market Despite Revenue Declines in Q3Their fears may be unfounded, though, according to the National Retail Foundation. In his monthly economic review, NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz wrote that the economy appears more resilient than anticipated and he does not expect an official recession.But consumers are still feeling the pinch of higher prices by cutting back on discretionary spending, as seen in the latest round of earnings reports. Many major footwear brands and retailers have reported sales declines, which have been exacerbated by excess inventory left over from 2022’s supply chain mess.Facing those serious challenges, company leaders are looking for ways to improve profitability — and divesting assets, such as brands and property, is one of the quickest ways to turn a balance sheet red to black.According to a report from global consulting firm Bain, retail companies will likely turn to M&amp;A activity for growth in 2023, as sales slow down and they look to expand their reach.At the same time, companies in healthier positions are seizing the opportunity to scoop up and reinvigorate these assets.Story continuesHere were three big deals announced just this week that suggest a fertile ground for M&amp;A activity this year.Designer Brands Buys Keds from WolverineOn Wednesday, Designer Brands Inc. announced that it had snapped up Keds from Wolverine Worldwide Inc. The news came just two months after WWW revealed its plan to offload the 107-year-old sneaker label via an acquisition or licensing deal.As part of this new agreement, DBI (the parent company of DSW and Camuto Group) will acquire all Keds products, including the Pro-Keds sneaker line, plus the brand’s e-commerce business. Prior to the deal, DSW was Keds’ largest wholesale customer. At the same time, DBI also picked up the global license for Hush Puppies, after previously having an exclusive wholesale deal with the brand for DSW.Though terms of the deal were not disclosed, Wolverine confirmed via a statement that the deals generated $90 million in cash for the company.This could be just the beginning for Wolverine, which said in December that it was also in the process of divesting its Wolverine Leathers business. And in a note to investors this week, analyst Jim Duffy at Stifel suggested the multibrand giant could benefit from more streamlining of its portfolio. “We see incremental opportunity for portfolio rationalization via divestiture of the Sperry brand,” Duffy wrote. “If Sperry were divested as well, with the licensing of Stride Rite in 2017 and now the sale of Keds, the remaining businesses in the Waltham HQ would be just Saucony and the Kids business. This, perhaps, presents opportunity for office downsizing or consolidation.”Meanwhile, DBI continues to show signs it’s hungry to grow under incoming CEO Doug Howe. The Columbus, Ohio-based footwear company in 2022 purchased Topo Athletic and signed the license for Le Tigre footwear.The company has stated it sees significant opportunity to grow revenue for its in-house brands. Last year, it estimated that sales from all its owned brands, including Camuto Group national owned and licensed brands, will double by 2026, to equal almost one-third of total sales.VF Is Putting Backpack Brands Up for SaleIn VF Corp.’s third-quarter earnings statement on Tuesday, interim president and CEO Benno Dorer confirmed that the company was “evaluating and deploying a series of strategic actions” to strengthen the company’s financial position.He said these actions include a review of the company’s Global Packs business, consisting of the Kipling, Eastpak and JanSport brands. “While these iconic and profitable businesses are strong contributors of value, VF is committed to ensuring they are optimally positioned to achieve their full potential while enhancing management focus on the company’s greatest strategic priorities,” the company noted in the earnings release.Bloomberg first reported in December that the JanSport brand, in particular, was up for grabs. Citing people close to the talks, the report said a deal could value the backpack and apparel brand at close to $500 million. Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic wrote in a December note that he was “skeptical” that VF could manage to raise $500 million for just JanSport. Other market experts have attached that number to the value of the entire Packs division.Overall, analysts are encouraged by VF’s plan to focus more on its core brand portfolio, after seeing sales slide at Vans and Dickies in fiscal Q3. Its outdoor division has been a bright spot, though, led by strong gains by The North Face. (VF’s portfolio also includes Timberland, Supreme, Altra, Napapijri and others.)Simon Property Sells Interest in Eddie BauerIn June 2021, Eddie Bauer was acquired by Authentic Brands Group and SPARC Group, a joint venture between Authentic and Simon Property Group. This week, though, Simon Property announced on its fourth-quarter earnings call that it has sold its interest in the Eddie Bauer JV in exchange for additional equity ownership in Authentic. According to CEO David Simon, the mall giant now has a 12% stake in Authentic, valued at $1.5 billion.The SPARC Group manages a robust portfolio that also includes Reebok, Brooks Brothers, Aéropostale, Forever 21, Lucky Brand and Nautica. But whether it will continue to add more names to the roster remains to be seen.Authentic Brands is certainly still on a deal-making hot streak. To kick off 2023, the company announced a new partnership in January with basketball legend Allen Iverson, and rumors recently circulated that Authentic was in talks to potentially buy the beleaguered Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and BuyBuy Baby retail chains.As for Simon Property, its CEO is less enthusiastic about acquisitions. “We really don’t have any plans to acquire anything. If we do, it will be opportunistically,” said Simon on the earnings call this week. “Generally, there’s not a lot of distress in retail right now. I’m not saying it won’t develop in the year. But there are some brands out there that are in trouble that obviously people know about. But we don’t see playing in any of those situations.”]"

(NYSE:PPG) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wouldnt-too-quick-buy-ppg-120535748.html,1676117135,STORY,['PPG'],"[PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase PPG Industries' shares before the 16th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.62 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.48 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, PPG Industries has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current stock price of $126.23. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether PPG Industries's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether PPG Industries can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for PPG Industries Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. PPG Industries paid out 56% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. So we're not too excited that PPG Industries's earnings are down 3.9% a year over the past five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, PPG Industries has increased its dividend at approximately 7.7% a year on average. That's interesting, but the combination of a growing dividend despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out more of the company's profits. This can be valuable for shareholders, but it can't go on forever.Story continuesTo Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid PPG Industries? Earnings per share have been declining and the company is paying out more than half its profits to shareholders; not an enticing combination.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Georgia Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Georgia would be the 27th biggest economy in the world with a GDP of $692 billion in 2021 which makes it bigger than Poland, Sweden, Belgium and Ireland. The 8th most populous state in the country, Georgia is one of only 15 states with a AAA rating. It is home to many major companies some of which are the biggest companies in the world in their own industries. The state is also home to the busiest airport in the world in Atlanta both in terms of aircraft traffic and passenger traffic in the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport while it is also home to one of the biggest seaports in North America.25 biggest Georgia companies and stocksCopyright: sepavo / 123RF Stock PhotoAtlanta, the capital of Georgia, is one of the most important global cities in the world not just because of having the biggest airport but being home to many major industries which include finance, insurance, technology, real estate manufacturing, logistics and communications.

Before the pandemic struck, Georgia's unemployment rate was at a historic low of 3.1% before climbing to 12.6% in just two months when the effect of the pandemic was fully felt. Clawing this back to 3% shows the progress the state has made in recovering from the pandemic which should help it navigate economic headwinds heading into 2023.Story continuesTo encourage businesses and their growth in Georgia, which includes various tax credits that allow you to reduce tax credits and is considered to be the first state in the Southeast to use single-factor appointment, which means that the corporate tax rate will be calculated only based on sales made inside Georgia.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Massachusetts would be 32nd largest economy in the world based on a 2021 GDP of $641 billion, which makes it bigger than Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Austria. The economy of Massachusetts is strongly based on technological research and development as well as the service sector, which dictates a major switch from its preindustrial economy which was largely dependent on agriculture and maritime trade. That is not to say that agriculture isn't an important contributor as it definitely is; it's just that it isn't as significant to the state's economy as it used to be. The pharmaceutical industry has a major presence in the state as well and several of the biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks are pharma / biotech companies.Education has always been considered important in Massachusetts and this should come as no surprise considering the fact that the oldest and one of the most prestigious ranked universities in Harvard University is located in the state. In addition, the state is considered to be a pioneer in kindergarten and secondary education as well, and this historic focus on education is no double linked to the success of the state in various metrics including being among the biggest states in the country.25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocksMarcio Jose Bastos Silva/Shutterstock.comIn November 2022, the unemployment rate of Massachusetts was 3.4%, which ranks it 22nd among all U.S. states. According to Boston Indicators, Massachusetts started to drop into recession after the Covid-19 pandemic hit but posted a quick and strong recovery which was needed after unemployment increased to a record 16% in April 2020. Even in 2022, the unemployment rate has continued to drop as it was 3.9% in 2021, and over half a million jobs have been regained since 2020. However, there are still challenges remaining relating to unemployment which includes an outflux of workers, and higher unemployment for minorities.Story continuesRight now, Massachusetts is moving more slowly than other New England states as the aforementioned labor outflux has exacerbated labor supply issues while higher interest rates have negatively impacted high growth companies such as tech and research and development, which we mentioned were the main sectors in the state. On the other hand, the professional services sector, which employs the highest number of people in the state, has posted a strong recovery in 2022.To encourage growth of businesses, Massachusetts provides several tax and other benefits including tax credits for cleaning up contaminated property, credits for investing in housing development projects, tax credits for taxpayers and businesses which make cash contributions to investment projects, and the Economic Development Incentive Program Credit to create and stimulate business within Massachusetts.The 25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks have a combined revenue of $486 billion and a market cap exceeding $1.22 trillion with three companies worth more than $100 billion headquartered in the state. To determine these companies, we obtained the 25 largest companies in the state from Fortune 500 based on revenue and determined their market cap from Yahoo finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap, and where the company wasn't listed, assigned it a ranking based on revenue alone.

The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%.Segments in DetailBruker reports results under three segments, namely, BSI Life Science (comprising BioSpin and CALID), BSI Nano and BEST.In the fourth quarter, BioSpin Group’s revenues rose 3.5% from the year-ago quarter to $203.4 million, led by strong growth in preclinical imaging and a notable contribution from the biopharma process analytical technology software acquisition.CALID’s revenues fell 7.7% year over year to $221.2 million in the fourth quarter due to constrained by supply chain delays.Story continuesRevenues of the Nano group climbed 17.8% to $227.2 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.53.Our TakeBruker ended 2022 with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line was driven by robust performance across most of the geographies and operating segments. Continued demand for our differentiated high-value solutions drove robust performance in bookings and revenues. Nano’s revenue growth in semiconductor industrial markets was particularly strong in the reported quarter.However, the decline in the CALID business does not bode well. Mounting operating costs are added concerns.

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.6%.Segmental Sales Break-UpIn the fiscal second quarter, Animal Health’s net sales increased 9% to $163.8 million. Within the segment, sales of medicated feed additives (MFAs) and others reflected 6% year-over-year growth. The uptick was driven by increased demand for the MFAs in Latin America and for processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry.Within Animal Health, nutritional specialty product sales rose 17%, primarily banking on higher domestic demand and higher average selling prices for dairy products, along with growth in companion animal products. Also, net vaccine sales showed a year-over-year rise of 4% on increased demand.Net sales in the Mineral Nutrition segment fell 8% year over year to $61.6 million due to a decline in demand for trace minerals.Net sales in the Performance Products segment rose 27% to $19.2 million, driven by increased demand for copper-based products and higher average selling prices for copper-based products and ingredients for personal care products.MarginsPhibro’s fiscal second-quarter gross profit rose 9.3% year over year to $77.4 million. The gross margin expanded 122 basis points (bps) to 31.6% on a 3.3% rise in the cost of goods sold to $167.3 million.Phibro Animal Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Phibro Animal Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhibro Animal Health Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Phibro Animal Health Corporation Quote Selling, general and administrative expenses in the reported quarter were $61.5 million, up 27.1% from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesOperating profit declined 29.1% year over year to $15.8 million and operating margin contracted 312 bps to 6.5% in the quarter under review.Financial UpdateThe company exited the fiscal second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $202 million compared with $86 million at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of the second quarter was $13.2 million compared with $23.9 million of operating cash inflow a year ago.Cumulative capital expenditure amounted to $33 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with $15.1 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidancePhibro reiterated its revenue guidance for fiscal 2023. The company expects net sales between $960 million and $1 billion for fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $976.7 million.Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.21 - $1.31. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.21.Our TakePhibro exited second-quarter fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Robust performances across Animal Health and Performance Products segments are encouraging. The growing uptake of MFAs, dairy products and vaccines buoys optimism. Expansion of gross margin is encouraging too.On the flip side, the company earnings registered a year-over-year decline. The Mineral Nutrition Products segment reported a year-over-year decline due to a decrease in demand for trace minerals.

Impressive contributions from the Sensor segment and domestic and international revenue growth were the key catalysts.Additionally, the glucose monitoring market presents significant commercial opportunities for the company. DexCom’s prospects in alternative markets such as non-intensive diabetes management, hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide it with a competitive edge in the MedTech space.Apart from making continued advancements with respect to its key strategic objectives, DexCom also ended the quarter with new patient additions. It launched an updated sensor algorithm in multiple countries in the second half of 2022, making the latest G7 sensor technology available to international markets. The company received FDA clearance for G7 sensor technology in December 2022. These developments are likely to support the company’s future growth.Nevertheless, the contraction in gross margin is a woe, reflecting the rising cost of sales. Apart from this, cut-throat competition in the market for blood &amp; glucose monitoring devices remains a concern.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, DexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

Chevron has condemned human rights abuses in the country.Myanmar's Ministry of Communication did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The U.S. company on Friday said it had agreed to sell for an undisclosed amount its 41.1% interest in the Yadana Project to a subsidiary of MTI. Yadana produces natural gas for domestic use and export to Thailand.French oil producer TotalEnergies sold its assets and left the country in July 2022.Chevron's sale follows a year-long business strategy in which it worked to reduce proceeds from the sale that would end up with the military government. Myanmar' state-controlled oil company MOGE was part of the joint venture.Before putting its Yadana stake for sale, Chevron temporarily increased its participation in the project from 28% to 41%, absorbing an interest TotalEnergies.The strategy aimed to gain greater control over the joint venture, and reduce what MOGE could make from the transaction or from the asset in the future.The military government took power in 2021, alleging fraud in a general election won by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party.

With a strong corporate fundamental backdrop in place, Texakoma is positioned to take advantage of current market opportunities in the private energy sector.Texakoma's business directives for 2023 focus on increasing its acreage position throughout Texas and Oklahoma. Asset allocation targets will include the acquisition of existing production, undeveloped acreage, and non-operated properties. With a highly skilled geological and engineering staff, decades of experience, strong oilfield relationships, and a strategic focus on directly sourcing potential opportunities, Texakoma has a market advantage over other exploration and production companies.The time is now to capitalize on what direct domestic energy opportunities offer. In a tight supply market where crude oil or natural gas production cannot keep up with global demands, prices will likely increase. JPMorgan has revised its 2023 oil forecast down to $90 per barrel, which is still higher than recent prices of $80 to $85 per barrel. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon calls for more investment in oil and gas, saying, ""We aren't getting this one right. The world needs 100 million barrels effectively of oil and gas every day. And we need it for 10 years.""

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $13.9 million, the contract is projected to be completed by June 2023. Work related to this deal will be executed in Groton, CT.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly due to upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features. To this end, military submarines and other defense ships with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form an integral part of any nation’s defense system.Therefore, the increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics with its Electric Boat business unit being the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs. The unit has established standards of excellence in the design, construction and lifecycle support of submarines for the U.S. Navy. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Looking ahead, General Dynamics is investing $1.8 billion of capital in expanded and modernized facilities at Electric Boat to support growth in submarine construction. It expects to substantially complete the investments by the end of 2023. Such investments are expected to enhance Electric Boat’s capability in submarine construction as well as provide lifecycle support for the same, which should enable it to win more contracts in the future.Peer MovesNations are reinforcing their defense capabilities to deter any warfare-like situation. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% between 2022 and 2031.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.Julie Cameron-Doe: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings, Brian Gullbrants, and Steve Whiteman in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Ian Coughlan, Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.Craig Billings: Thanks, Julie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As we prepared for this call, I looked at an old analyst note that was published after our Q4 2019 earnings. The expectation for 2022 EBITDA Wynn Las Vegas in that note was $482 million. Here we are three years in the global pandemic later and Wynn Las Vegas just printed $816 million of normalized adjusted property EBITDA, $816 million. I'm confident that this is an all-time record for a stand-alone Las Vegas strip property. And mind you, we did not deliver this result by nickel and diming on service standards and reducing staff to drive operating leverage. The team did it by focusing on what we do best. Great products, great service, great programming, and it showed in our market share and pricing power.The Wynn Las Vegas team absolutely crushed it in 2022. Our business in Vegas is stronger and more relevant than it has ever been. I'll talk more about the fourth quarter in Vegas in our outlook in a moment. Turning to several other significant events, I'd like to touch on our concession renewal and the reopening of Macau. I was in Macau for nearly three weeks in December. And after going through the then required quarantine, I was fortunate to attend the signing ceremony for our new concession. I'm proud of the plan that we put forward as part of the concession renewal and believe that the CapEx and programming we proposed will be additive to our business there over the coming years. I would like to thank the government of Macau for their faith in us.Story continuesAnd importantly, I would like to thank the Wynn Macau team for their dedication to our business over the past three very difficult years. Fortunately, recent actions by both Macau and Mainland authorities to reopen the market give us great confidence that the difficulties are behind us and the near-term future there much brighter. Over the past several weeks, we've welcomed back an increasing number of guests as the region has reopened to travel and tourism in a meaningful way. With our premium product and service levels, we are well positioned to lead the post-COVID recovery in Macau, and our strengths were evident during the recent Chinese New Year holiday period. In the casino, mass table drop reached 95% of 2019 Chinese New Year levels with strong play across the spectrum from premium mass to core mass.In direct VIP, turnover was 40% above pre-COVID Chinese New Year levels. And importantly, we estimate that our hold-normalized GGR market share during the month of January was consistent with 2019 levels despite all the changes in the junket environment, define the expectations of those who continue to incorrectly believe that we are solely a VIP focused organization. On the non-gaming side, hotel occupancy was 96%, and our tenant retail sales increased 34% compared to Chinese New Year 2019. Overall, during the Chinese New Year period, we delivered our strongest EBITDA performance since the onset of the pandemic, approximately $4 million of normalized EBITDA per day. Turning back to Las Vegas. The team at Wynn Las Vegas turned in a fourth quarter record with $219 million of EBITDA.We saw broad-based strength across casino, hotel, F&amp;B, entertainment and retail, all well above Q4 2021 levels, despite the difficult year-over-year comps. Our investment in people, facilities and programming and our team's deep sense of personal ownership of our business continue to drive growth. We continue to monitor economic trends and forward bookings at Wynn Las Vegas. We're encouraged that the strength we have experienced over the past several quarters has continued into Q1. Similarly, our forward-looking indicators also remain quite strong despite well-known macro concerns as room bookings are pacing at/or above pre-COVID-19 levels on substantially higher ADRs. Turning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $63 million of EBITDAR.We saw strength across the casino with record gross gaming revenue and on the non-gaming side with strong hotel revenue, driven by both ADR and occupancy. The strength has continued into the first quarter with EBITDA per day in January, largely consistent with trends we have experienced over the past few quarters. We were also pleased to launch retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor last week, averaging a little over 0.5 million a day in handle over the first six days, which is about 80% of the average daily handle at Wynn Las Vegas. During those six days, we also signed up about 30% more Wynn Rewards members than normal. We continue to expect the book to be a significant driver for new customer acquisition over time. We also continue to advance our plans for our upcoming development project across the street from the property that will include incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities.At Wynn Interactive, our overall EBITDA burn rate in the quarter ticked up sequentially to $28 million due to a well-publicized World Series bet that went against us. Adjusted for that single bet, burn was roughly flat. Our team continues to stay disciplined on cost while driving improved marketing efficiency. We're looking forward to the potential for a significant catalyst for WynnBET in Massachusetts with the combination of our recently launched retail book and the expected upcoming launch of online sports betting. Lastly, we are quickly advancing our planning for Wynn Al Marjan Island, our integrated resort in the UAE. We're in the late stages of programming for the resort, and I expect we will be driving piles for the foundation of the property by the middle of the year.I also expect we will share renderings, programming and plans publicly over the next few months. The more time we spend in that market, the more confident we are in the project. With that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?Lucky Business/Shutterstock.comJulie Cameron-Doe: Thank you, Craig. At Las Vegas, we generated a fourth quarter record of $219.3 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $585.5 million of operating revenue during the quarter, lower-than-normal hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $10.5 million in Q4. Our hotel occupancy was 89.9% in the quarter, up 350 basis points year-over-year and up 50 basis points versus Q4 2019. Importantly, we've stayed true to our luxury brand and continued to compete on quality of product and service experience with our overall ADR reaching a record $492 during Q4 2022, up 11.8% versus Q4 2021 and 53% above Q4 2019 levels. Our other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across F&amp;B, entertainment and retail, which were up nicely year-over-year and also well above pre-pandemic levels.In the casino, our Q4 2022 slot handle increased 20.9% year-over-year and was 69% above Q4 2019 levels. Similarly, our table drop was up 1.1% year-over-year and was 43% above Q4 2019 levels, despite still suppressed international play during the quarter due to COVID-related travel challenges. The team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 37.4% in the quarter. On a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA margin was up approximately 1,300 basis points compared to Q4 2019. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $3.8 million in Q4 2022, up 25% compared to Q4 2019 levels but well below the 59% increase in operating revenue. In Boston, before getting into the details, I'd like to point out that following the closing of the sale leaseback transaction on December 1, we're now reporting adjusted property EBITDAR for this business.In Q4 2022, we generated adjusted property EBITDA of $63.3 million with EBITDA margin of 29%. We saw broad-based strength across casino and nongaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $190 million of GGR, a property record with strength in both tables and slots. Our nongaming revenue grew 13% year-over-year to a record $56.8 million with particular strength in the hotels, driven by 93.9% occupancy and a $404 ADR. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day of approximately $1.17 million in Q4 2022. This was a decrease of over 8% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 2019 and up modestly relative to Q3 2022. As we've discussed on prior calls, the year-over-year EBITDA and OpEx comps were impacted by a combination of contractual labor agreements, which added around $45,000 per day to our OpEx base, beginning late in Q2 2022, along with a nonrecurring benefit of $2 million in Q4 last year.We're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time. Our Macau operations delivered an EBITDA loss of $59.1 million in the quarter on $190.3 million of operating revenues. Lower than normal hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $25 million in Q4. While the COVID situation in the region was challenging during Q4, as Craig noted, we were encouraged by the meaningful uptick in visitation and demand we experienced during the recent Chinese holiday period. Our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2 million per day in Q4, a decrease compared to $2.4 million in Q4 2021. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs in a difficult operating environment. Longer term, we are well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.In terms of the new concession, we approached the tender process very prudently, carefully balancing our commitments to the government with our responsibilities to our shareholders and, of course, our liquidity position. We're currently advancing through the design and planning stages, but these projects require a number of government approvals creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very near term. As such, for 2023, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $50 million to $220 million. Our future non-gaming investments, including new center set to be home of a unique spectacle show and innovative food halls and an events and entertainment center. As Craig noted, we believe these investments play into our strength as we have a demonstrated track record of introducing innovative non-gaming investments that drive increased tourism and ultimately, strong shareholder returns.Turning to Wynn Interactive. Our EBITDA burn rate increased sequentially to $28.3 million in Q4 2022. However, adjusting for the well-publicized World Series bet that Craig mentioned, it was roughly flat with our Q3 2022 burn rate of $17.7 million. The team continues to control costs while driving improved marketing efficiencies. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.5 billion as of December 31. This was comprised of $952 million of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $3.5 billion in the U.S. These numbers exclude the undrawn $500 million intercompany revolving credit facility Wynn Resorts entered into with Wynn Macau. We were pleased to close the sale leaseback transaction for the real estate of Encore Boston Harbor on December 1 with gross proceeds of $1.7 billion, further bolstering our already strong liquidity position.Importantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston, with the properties generating $1.04 billion of adjusted property EBITDA during 2022 together with our robust liquidity, creates a very healthy leverage profile in the U.S. With our properties performing well in each of our markets and our robust liquidity, I'd like to note our intention to repay our upcoming May 2023, Wynn Las Vegas bond maturity with cash from the balance sheet, reducing our domestic gross leverage by $500 million. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $27 million, primarily related to normal course maintenance. With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&amp;A.See also 23 Most Powerful Countries in the World and US States' GDP Compared to Other Countries.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

In the last reported quarter, Zoetis reported a negative earnings surprise of 2.42%.Shares of Zoetis have fallen 19.2% in the past year, compared with the industry’s 14.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet's see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe veterinary drugmaker derives most of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. Zoetis’ remaining revenues are derived from its non-pharmaceutical product categories, such as nutritional and agribusiness and products and services in biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health.The company reports business results under two geographical operating segments — the United States and International.In the last reported quarter, revenues in the United States segment were up 2% year over year. The trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the United States is pegged at $1.08 billion.Zoetis’ international revenues in the last reported quarter decreased by 2% year over year on a reported basis. This trend is also expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for international revenues is pegged at $907 million.Under both the U.S. and international operating segments, the company reported growth across its key dermatology portfolio in the last reported quarter, driven by the increased sales of Apoquel and Cytopoint brands. The trend is anticipated to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Zoetis’ companion animal business has also been performing well, primarily owing to higher sales of Simparica Trio, a triple combination parasiticide for dogs and the recent launches of its mAb therapies, Librela and Solensia.Story continuesHowever, livestock product sales and sales of cattle products declined year over year, a trend that most likely continued in the fourth quarter. Sales of poultry products also declined in the last reported quarter in the United States due to the expanded use of lower-cost alternatives for premium products, but experienced growth in the International segment because ofmarket growth and demand generation efforts. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. In the last reported quarter, sales of swine products declined year over year due to increased competition for vaccines, a trend that is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Zoetis this time around.

I'll start this morning with some brief comments on our fourth quarter, and I'll turn to our full year results and our view on 2023. Before I get started, however, I'm sure you saw our announcement that John Sznewajs has decided to retire from Masco, effective at the end of May, and we are working to identify his replacement. John has been a fixture at Masco and in the industry for over 25 years now, and has been an invaluable partner to me, our Board and the investment community during his 15-year tenure as CFO of our company. He will be sorely missed, and we wish John all the best in his future endeavors. Now please turn to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, our top-line decreased 5%, as we saw lower volumes across most categories, partially offset by significant pricing actions of 9%.Story continuesOur operating profit declined in the quarter due to the lower volumes, higher operational costs and currency. This was partially offset by pricing actions and expense control as SG&amp;A declined $22 million to 17.4% of sales. Our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.65. Earnings per share benefited from a lower average diluted share count as well as effective tax rate of 24%, lower than our previously guided 25%. Turning to our segments. Plumbing grew 2% in local currency with a 1% decline in North American Plumbing, offset by 7% growth in International Plumbing. Hansgrohe drove market share gains in many key markets, including China, Germany and France. Our International business has continued to execute well, which speaks to the strength of the Hansgrohe team, its strong brands and its ability to gain market share.In North America, our spa business has now worked through its extended backlog and backlogs are now in the normal range of four to six weeks after a tremendous three-year run of more than 50% sales growth. Turning to our Decorative Architectural segment. Sales declined 8% against a strong 15% comp. DIY paint sales declined low double digits, while PRO paint continued its excellent performance with mid-single digit growth against a tremendous comp of over 50%. Now let's review our full-year performance. Please turn to Slide 6. 2022 was a challenging year with strong growth in the first half followed by notable declines in demand in the second half. Despite these volatile conditions, Masco and our 19,000 employees across the globe responded well to deliver for our customers and our shareholders.For the full year, the company grew sales 4% for a two-year stacked comp of 21%. Strong pricing actions increased sales by 9%, offset by volume declines of 3% and currency impact of 2%. Volume growth in the first half of the year was more than offset by volume declines in the second half. Operating profit declined 7% with an operating margin of 15.6%, and earnings per share increased from $3.77 -- to $3.77 from $3.70. Total commodity and other inflation was low double digits for the full year. This inflation, together with supply chain challenges, resulted in lower margins for the year despite our significant pricing actions. We are focused on improving our margins by continuing to drive productivity as we apply our 80/20 mindset to return to our pre-pandemic levels.Turning to our segments. Our Plumbing segment grew 6% excluding currency, led by strong growth at both Hansgrohe and Watkins. In our Decorative Architectural segment, full year growth was 6%. DIY paint grew low single digits for the year, while PRO paint grew over 25%. PRO paint has had a tremendous three-year run of approximately 70% growth, and now accounts for one-third of our paint business or over $900 million. This strong performance earned Behr its second consecutive Partner of the Year Award for the Home Depot. We will continue to invest in our paint business to capture further share in both the DIY and PRO markets. Our recently launched adjacent paint categories such as aerosols, interior stains and caulks and sealants have performed well and are expanding the offering to additional stores and expect further share gains in 2023.We will be launching Behr Dynasty Exterior for the summer painting season, expanding the lineup of our number one rated Dynasty paint line. And we will continue to invest in people and capabilities to better serve the PRO painter and continue our strong PRO performance. Turning to capital allocation. Our strong balance sheet allowed us to deploy approximately $1.2 billion in capital during the year. We repurchased 16.6 million shares for $914 million, representing approximately 7% of our outstanding shares. We increased our quarterly dividend 19% and paid $258 million in dividends to shareholders. And we finished the year with net leverage of 1.8 times, providing us ample financial flexibility. Our balanced, disciplined approach to capital allocation and strong cash flow resulted in a return on invested capital of approximately 39%.Lastly, on the ESG front, we believe our business should be part of the solution to the world's climate crisis. Therefore, we have established a target to reduce our emissions by 50% by the year 2030, aligned with science-based targets. This is consistent with our commitment to doing business the right way and our purpose to provide better living possibilities for homes, our environment and our community. I want to thank all our employees for their outstanding efforts throughout 2022. It is a team effort to continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Now, turning to 2023. We expect the softening demand trends in the second half of 2022 to continue into 2023 as our markets adjust to increasing interest rates, persistent inflation and tighter consumer spending.Overall, we anticipate volumes to decline in the low double digit range, offset, to a small extent, by pricing actions. Our current market assumptions for 2023 are as follows. For the North American repair and remodel market, we expect the market to be down approximately low double digits. This is after a very strong three-year run of approximately 20% growth. For the paint market, we expect the DIY paint market to be down high-single digits and the PRO market to decline by mid-single digits. And for our International markets, principally Europe, we expect markets to contract by high-single digits. As a result, we anticipate Masco sales in 2023 to decline approximately 10%. With this lower top-line assumption, we will drive to minimize our decremental margins to be in the low 20% range versus our typical 30% decremental margins.We are focused on recovering the significant cost inflation we experienced over the past two years through operational productivity, supply chain normalization and additional pricing actions. With this focus, we expect our operating margin to be approximately 15% in 2023. Turning to capital allocation. Our strategy remains unchanged. First and foremost, we will invest in our business to maintain and grow our leadership positions and win in the recovery. The second pillar of our capital allocation strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with gross debt to EBITDA levels of below 2.5 times. Third, we have a targeted dividend payout ratio of 30%. Our Board declared a 2% increase in our dividend for 2023, which will bring our annual dividend to $1.14 per share and marks the tenth consecutive annual increase.We expect our cash flow conversion to be over 100% in 2023, as we manage our working capital. We will deploy that free cash flow after dividends to share repurchases or acquisitions. Based on our projected free cash flow, we expect to deploy approximately $500 million to share repurchases or acquisitions in 2023, in addition to paying the remaining $200 million of our term loan. Lastly, there is no change to our M&amp;A strategy. We continue to review and selectively pursue opportunities that have the right strategic fit and the right return for Masco. With the actions we are taking to address this more challenging environment, coupled with our continued strong capital deployment, we anticipate earnings per share for 2023 to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share.Corporation, Building, BusinessPhoto by Self Taught on UnsplashWhile we expect the near-term environment will remain challenging as our markets and the economy adjust to higher interest rates and prices, we believe the long-term fundamentals of our repair and remodel markets are strong. Cyclical factors such as home price appreciation and existing turnover will remain challenged and likely a headwind for 2023. However, structural factors, such as consumers staying in their homes longer, the age of housing stock and high home equity levels will drive increased repair and remodel activity in several ways. Many homeowners have taken advantage of low mortgage rates and are likely to remain in their homes longer. 1.5 million more homes will reach the prime remodeling ages of 20 to 39 years old over the next three years.And home equity levels remain high and can withstand significant pullbacks in home prices and still be above 2019 levels. All of these structural forces provide tailwinds for our business and increase our confidence for a strong repair and remodel market after the economy stabilizes in 2023. We will continue to invest in our brands, capabilities and people to outperform the composition in both the near and the long term. With favorable fundamentals and our continued focus on executing our growth strategy, together with our strong free cash flow and capital deployment, we are positioned to continue to drive shareholder value creation for the long term. Now, I'll turn the call over to John to go over our fourth quarter, full year and '23 outlook in more detail.John?John Sznewajs: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my comments, I want to take a moment to thank Keith, our Board and the entire Masco organization for the opportunity to serve as CFO for more than 15 years. I've had an amazing and fulfilling 27-year career with company. As I look forward to my retirement, I wish everyone the best. With that, as Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items. Turning to Slide 8. Sales in the quarter decreased 5% and, excluding currency, decreased 2%. Lower volumes decreased sales by 11%, partially offset by net selling prices, which increased sales by 9%. In local currency, North American sales decreased 5%.Lower volume decreased sales by 14%, partially offset by higher net selling prices, which increased sales by 10%. In local currency, International sales increased 7%, driven by increased selling prices. As it relates to inventory, we believe channel inventories have stabilized as we saw sell-through approximately equal to sell-in and destocking had minimal impact in the quarter. Our gross margin of 29.5% was impacted by lower volumes, and higher year-over-year operational costs in the quarter. Our SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales improved 20 basis points to 17.4% through continued cost discipline. Our operating profit in the fourth quarter was $234 million and operating margin was 12.2%. Operating profit was impacted by lower volumes, higher operational costs and currency, partially offset by higher net selling prices.Lastly, our EPS in the quarter was $0.65. I would like to note that this performance was based on a tax rate of 24% versus the previously guided 25% tax rate due to the implementation of our tax planning strategies. Because of this assumption, we have provided restated adjusted EPS numbers for the first three quarters of 2022 in the appendix on Slide 28. Turning to the full year 2022. Sales increased 4% over prior year against a healthy comp of 17% for full year 2021. Excluding currency, sales increased 6%. Higher net selling prices increased sales by 9%, partially offset by lower volumes, which decreased sales by 3%. In local currency, North American sales increased 6% and the International sales increased 8%. Our SG&amp;A as a percent of sales decreased 90 basis points to 16%.Operating profit for the full year was $1.4 billion and operating margin was 15.6%. Lastly, our EPS increased 2% to $3.77. This amount also assumes a tax rate of 24% versus a previously guided 25%, which favorably impacted full year EPS by $0.05. Our adjusted EPS calculation for 2023 will continue to assume a 24% tax rate. I want to thank our employees across the globe for their hard work and dedication to achieve these solid results during a challenging year. Turning to Slide 9. Plumbing sales in the quarter decreased 3%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales grew 2%. Pricing contributed 9% to growth and volume decreased sales by 7%. North American Plumbing sales decreased 1% in local currency. This was driven by lower demand we started to experience in the third quarter.Lower demand was fairly broad based across product categories and channels. International Plumbing sales increased 7% in local currency. Hansgrohe grew sales in many of their key markets, most notably China, Germany and France. Segment operating profit in the fourth quarter was $148 million and operating margin was 12.4%. Operating profit was impacted by lower volumes, higher operational costs and currency, partially offset by higher net selling prices. Turning to the full year 2022, Plumbing sales increased 2%. Excluding currency, sales increased 6% with net selling prices contributing 7% to growth, partially offset by lower volume mix, which decreased sales by 1%. In local currency, North American Plumbing sales grew 5% and International Plumbing sales increased 8%.Full year operating profit was $834 million, with an operating margin of 15.9%. Turning to Slide 10. Decorative Architectural sales decreased 8% for the fourth quarter against a 15% comp. Our PRO paint sales increased mid-single digits against a robust comp of over 50% in the fourth quarter 2021, as we continue to see solid demand for our PRO paint offering, strong brands and high-quality products. Our DIY paint sales declined low double digits versus prior year. Additionally, our lighting and builders' hardware businesses, in aggregate, declined mid-teens in the quarter against a solid mid-single digit comp. Operating profit was $101 million in the quarter and operating margin was 13.9%. Operating profit was impacted by lower volumes and higher material costs, partially offset by higher net selling prices.Turning to the full year 2022, sales increased 6%, driven by low single digit growth in our DIY paint business and outstanding PRO paint growth of over 25%. Full year operating income was $608 million and operating margin was 17.7%. Turning to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet is strong with net debt to EBITDA at 1.8 times. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. Working capital as a percent of sales was 17.4% at year-end. In 2023, with expected lower volumes and less supply chain disruptions, we anticipate working capital as a percent of sales to improve and be approximately 16.5% at year-end. In 2022, we also paid down $300 million of the $500 million term loan that we borrowed in the second quarter of the year.Finally, during 2022, we repurchased 16.6 million shares for $914 million and returned $258 million to shareholders through dividends. Now, let's turn to Slide 12 and review our outlook for 2023. I'd like to preface our guidance by reminding everyone that these are uncertain times, which makes forecasting extremely challenging. For Masco overall, we are planning for volumes to be down in the low double digit range, partially offset by low single digit pricing. Based on this assumption, we expect 2023 sales to decline approximately 10%, with operating margins of approximately 15%. Currency is projected to have minimal impact on our 2023 results. Our SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales trended below our normal levels during the pandemic. However, as we continue to invest in our businesses for future growth while maintaining cost discipline, we expect this percentage to increase back to a more normalized pre-pandemic level to be around 17.5% for 2023.As always, we will take appropriate actions to address our costs as the year develops based on market conditions. Operating margins will be impacted more in the first half of the year due to lower volumes and strong year-over-year sales comps, particularly in the Decorative Architectural segment. As we previously discussed, operating profit in the first quarter will also be impacted by the higher operational costs we experienced starting in Q2 last year, particularly in the Plumbing segment. As we think about the cadence for the year, we expect our Q1 sales and margin profile to look similar Q4 2022 with our year-over-year operating margins expanding -- expected to improve each quarter thereafter. In our Plumbing segment, we expect 2023 sales to decline in the range of 10% to 14%.We anticipate the full year Plumbing margins will be roughly flat with 2022 segment margins at approximately 16%. Lower volumes and, in the first quarter, higher operational costs will impact margins, with favorable selling price increases partially offsetting these headwinds. In our Decorative Architectural segment, we expect 2023 sales to decline in the range of 5% to 10%. Looking specifically at paint for 2023, we currently anticipate our DIY business to decrease high-single digits and our PRO business to decrease mid-single digits, as we cycle over 25% PRO paint growth in 2022. We anticipate the full year Decorative Architectural margin to be approximately 16%. This margin is largely due to our significant pricing actions in this segment that typically only recover the dollar amount of the inflation.As a result, all else equal, operating profit dollars remain neutral from cost recovery pricing actions, but results in margin compression. We are also playing an increased investment in people and capabilities in 2023 to drive future growth in our PRO paint business. As it relates to share repurchases, we have begun modest share repurchases and expect to spend approximately $500 million on share repurchases, with this activity being weighted more towards the second half of the year. Finally, as Keith mentioned earlier, our 2023 EPS estimate is $3.10 to $3.40. This assumes a 226 million average diluted share count for the year and a 24% effective tax rate. Additional modeling assumptions for 2023 can be found on Slide 15 in our earnings deck.With that, I'd like to open up the call for Q&amp;A.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Retail Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.The Retail Industry's Woes in 2022The stock market turmoil of 2022 also affected retail stocks, as consumers cut back on spending and braced for recession. The worst hit in the sector were consumer discretionary stocks. According to a Bloomberg report published in November 2022, retail companies were bracing for a weak holiday season as they didn’t see any signs of consumers upping their discretionary spending in the period. The report said that Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) shares fell after the company announced that sales trend would remain soft in October. The company specifically cited weakness in the sales of gift items. The National Retail Federation also forecast a slow holiday season when compared to 2021. Retail giant Amazon was also expecting the slowest holiday-quarter growth in its history.Later, data from the Commerce Department confirmed the market’s worries. Retail sales in November fell 0.6%. Furniture and home furnishings stores posted a decline of 2.6%, while building materials and garden centers fell 2.5%. Data shows that motor vehicle and parts dealers dropped 2.3%.The December retail sales report also showed the impact of inflation and interest rate hikes on the retail sector. Data shows that US retail sales fell 1.1% in December. A Bloomberg article quoted Bob Michele, chief investment officer at JPMorgan Asset Management, who said that the impact of Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes has started to make itself visible. He said that the quantitative tightening is “starting to bite the economy.”Goldman Sachs was also seeing an increasing volatility for retail companies heading into the holiday season of 2022. According to Bloomberg, Goldman was expecting this volatility due to “uncertain macro environment and reversals from the prior two years of pandemic-induced spending.”Story continuesThe report also mentioned a Goldman survey in which the firm asked 1,000 US consumers about their holiday shopping plans. About 46% of the surveyed consumers said they plan on spending less during 2022 holiday season.According to a Deloitte report, only one-third of retail executives have strong confidence that they would be able to maintain profit margins in 2023. The report said that all retail executives expect inflation to pressure their profit margins. The report said the retail industry is expecting “hard times” for consumers as well and expect the consumption to fall in 2023 amid inflation and financial concerns.Our MethodologyFor this article we first used stock screeners to identify retail stocks trading at a PE ratio of less than 20 as of February 2.

I don’t know what is happening and with Corinne (Suter) on the podium, I don’t know, more than a dream has come true.""I didn't expect to win today.""Austrian Nina Ortlieb, whose father Patrick won the world downhill title in 1996 as well as Olympic gold in Val d'Isere in 1992, claimed silver at 0.04sec, with Switzerland's reigning world and Olympic champion Suter taking bronze a further eight-hundredths adrift.Ortlieb said her silver was ""reward for all the hard work"" after almost two years on the sidelines rehabbing from severe injury.""I have more world championships to come, maybe one day I can also bring home a gold!"" said Ortlieb.- 'More than disappointed' -There was no dream outing for Goggia, however, with all eyes on the Italian star who is the Olympic silver medallist having bagged gold in the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, and is currently leading this season's World Cup downhill standings having also won the downhill crystal globe in three of the last five seasons.Goggia badly negotiated the last rolling pitch leading into the finish area and straddled a gate.

Chevron has condemned human rights abuses in the country.Myanmar's Ministry of Communication did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The U.S. company on Friday said it had agreed to sell for an undisclosed amount its 41.1% interest in the Yadana Project to a subsidiary of MTI. Yadana produces natural gas for domestic use and export to Thailand.French oil producer TotalEnergies sold its assets and left the country in July 2022.Chevron's sale follows a year-long business strategy in which it worked to reduce proceeds from the sale that would end up with the military government. Myanmar' state-controlled oil company MOGE was part of the joint venture.Before putting its Yadana stake for sale, Chevron temporarily increased its participation in the project from 28% to 41%, absorbing an interest TotalEnergies.The strategy aimed to gain greater control over the joint venture, and reduce what MOGE could make from the transaction or from the asset in the future.The military government took power in 2021, alleging fraud in a general election won by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party.

But the FTSE 100 still slipped 0.5 percent after having hit record highs earlier this week.""In reality, the nuances of whether the UK is or isn’t in a recession are likely to be lost on the majority of people, many of whom are struggling with their finances on a day-to-day basis,"" said market analyst Michael Hewson at CMC Markets.Bucking the downward stock markets trend, Tokyo rose Friday on a weaker yen, though the currency rallied after the market closed on reports that the Japanese government would nominate Kazuo Ueda to replace Haruhiko Kuroda as head of the country's central bank.Ueda is an economist and former member of the Band of Japan policy board. But analysts said the yen's advance may be more to do with the fact deputy governor Masayoshi Amamiya would not take the post, which would have likely seen a continuation of the current dovish approach.""While unexpected and a potentially hawkish development it probably doesn't change that much from a monetary policy point of view in the short term,"" said Hewson.- Key figures around 2130 GMT -Brent North Sea crude: UP 2.2 percent at $86.39 per barrelWest Texas Intermediate: UP 2.1 percent at $79.72 per barrelNew York - Dow: UP 0.5 percent at 33,869.27 (close)New York - S&amp;P 500: UP 0.2 percent at 4,090.46 (close)New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 0.6 percent at 11,718.12 (close)London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.4 percent at 7,882.45 (close)Frankfurt - DAX: DOWN 1.4 percent at 15,307.98 (close)Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.8 percent at 7,129.73 (close)EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 1.2 percent at 4,197.94 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 27,670.98 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 2.0 percent at 21,190.42 (close)Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.3 percent at 3,260.67 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0684 from $1.0740 on ThursdayPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2051 from $1.2121Euro/pound: DOWN at 88.56 pence from 88.61 penceDollar/yen: DOWN at 131.42 yen from 131.59 yenburs-jmb/bgs]"

The company did say a January surge in bookings points to future upside, and Wall Street analysts seem fairly confident that positive 2023 guidance will be enough to make up for the disappointing Q4 results. But it is interesting to also see Airbnb shares trading to the downside today on the heels of Expedia's miss. The New York Times was actually out with an article about how short-term rentals, they are fumbling ahead of the Super Bowl in Phoenix, in particular, due to the high demand that we've seen in a lot of these different travel companies.I don't know if you guys have noticed that.- No.- I think there is a lot of competition.- Just specifically in Arizona?- Specifically in Phoenix, for the Super Bowl. A lot of these people bought homes in 2021 thinking, oh, I'm going to make like, $10,000 a night for the Super Bowl. But now there's just so much competition in this short-term rental market that that could be another headwind for some of these travel sites.- There's also so much building in the Arizona area, and if you haven't been to a Super Bowl in Arizona, which I have a couple of times, it's a massive area. You're talking about an hour between the stadium and Tempe and Phoenix. There's just a huge, enormous swath of area.You do well when the Super Bowl city is a smaller concentrated area, so that's, in particular, I think what's happening there. But I read through the transcript of the earnings call when it comes to Expedia, and the word that came up at least a dozen times was their loyalty members. Their CEO Peter Kern said they entered '23 with 70% more active loyalty members than any prior year, and that's who they monetize the most. So they're very excited.]"

The Nasdaq was down 0.6%, and the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2%.Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended the day flat, but its days of selling - in the wake of its AI chatbot Bard's mishap - wounded sentiment on tech. A fall in semiconductors also weighed on tech following a slide in Nvidia.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell more than 4% as some question how much upside lies ahead for the stock, which is up about 44% year to date on bets that the surge in interest in AI applications – following strong demand for OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool – will boost chip demand.“Nvidia is trading rich from a valuation perspective,” said Greg Bassuk, chief executive officer at AXS Investments in New York, pointing to the risk of “multiple compression” ahead.Sentiment on growth sectors like tech were also hurt by renewed concerns of Fed hikes, with many now expecting the Fed to follow up its March hike, with another hike in May.Treasury yields jumped, with the 2-year Treasury yield closing above 4.5% for the first time since November.The earnings front, meanwhile, served up mostly weaker than expected results.LYFT Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) tumbled more than 36%, its biggest single-day decline, after the ride-sharing company reported revenue guidance that fell short of estimates and a surprise quarterly loss as lower prices and rising costs hurt margins.“A different mix of rides, improving driver supply will cause less primetime pricing, and reduced base pricing due to heightened competition are all negatively impacting FY23 outlook,” Wedbush said as it downgraded the stock to Neutral from Outperform.Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), meanwhile, reported quarterly results that missed on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 8% lower. But some analysts attributed the weakness to weather-related cancellations of bookings that weighed on quarterly results.Story continues“[W]e are inclined to look through reported 4Q numbers, as Hurricane Ian in October and a rash of weather-related cancellations late in December served as the primary factors behind the miss,” Deustche Bank said in a note.Energy stocks kept losses in the broader market in check, supported by rising oil prices after Russia said it would cut production by 500,000 barrels per day next month, at a time when many are expecting energy demand to be bolstered by the China reopening.“The 1.1 mb/d rise in China demand this year (Q4/Q4) should push oil markets back into deficit in June, expose structural underinvestment, boost prices, and lead OPEC to reverse its November 2022 production cut in 2023H2 (the second half of 2023),” Goldman Sachs said in a note after cutting its 2023 price target on Brent crude by $5 to $75 per barrel.In other news, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 5% after its investor Ross Gerber said he will pursue a seat on the electric carmaker's board amid frustrations about the electric carmaker's lack of marketing, and public relations efforts.""Tesla has let Elon be the voice of Tesla forever.

While demand has been markedly stronger since the start of the year, according to Expedia CEO, shares are dipping to the downside by nearly 6% after these latest earnings.The company is trying to say that things are improving already in January, that lodgings were up 20% in January, compared with 2019. And monthly growth did reach the high single digits in the fourth quarter, but you have to back out the effect of Hurricane Ian in October and of other various winter storms in December to get to that better growth.And I mean, you kind of can't back out weather. Weather is something, I mean, as we were talking about with scooters and stuff, like, it happens every winter, right? And hurricanes happen every hurricane season, so you kind of have to bake them in, I think.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, yeah, no doubt. For that, we could even check in with our local kind of micro-mobility correspondent, Mike Jong, who would let us know that, yes, weather does impact--BRIAN SOZZI: I love that guy, Mike.BRAD SMITH: Oh--BRIAN SOZZI: Mike is awesome.BRAD SMITH: Solid bike. Jared Blikre--JULIE HYMAN: He's also got a bike.BRAD SMITH: --also has a--BRIAN SOZZI: Full bike's got two wheels. It's great.BRAD SMITH: Jared has an indestructible scooter that sits upstairs near a desk, but anyway, that's micromobility. This right here is another part of travel. And that is Airbnb. Well, not Airbnb. That's next week, excuse me. I'm just excited. But thinking about Expedia, one thing that they did call out was that total lodgings. And that lodging is going to be something that will be a pull through to next week when we discuss Airbnb. But those gross bookings, highest Q4 on record, up 4% on a reported basis, 6% like for like basis versus Q4 2019.Story continuesSo that's something they continue to kind of parse through some of these earnings reports. And the calls with is to look for where that demand is continuing to hold up. We've continued to hear about a countercyclical recovery in travel. And that continues to be one of the underlying stories here. And we'll see if that holds true.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, it is holding true so far. So, of course, as you guys just mentioned, you had Peter Kern, CEO of Expedia-- he's coming on next week with us-- noting that January was strong. That's good. I like those Hilton numbers this week. Occupancy up across the board, RevPAR up across the board, good guidance as well.And if you really want to go crazy here, go back to the earnings release from Edgewell Personal Care. They're the maker of Banana Boat. They came on with us earlier in the week. They said suntan lotion sales were looking pretty strong as well. So it looks like, at least in the first half, people are paying up for vacations. And of course, you had those Disney theme park numbers. Those were good, too.JULIE HYMAN: But these numbers weren't great, right? Sales missed estimates, bookings missed estimates, EBITDA missed estimates. I mean, you mentioned Airbnb, and I do think that you have to separate out, is demand for travel coming back? Yes, most certainly. Are these companies benefiting from it enough to satisfy the Street? Not necessarily. So are we going to see which category? There's a little suspense now when it comes to an Airbnb or a Booking Holdings, right?

For more top stocks, head on over to Bank of America's 5 Stock Picks for 2023. 2023 is turning out to be an interesting year for the stock market. After major technology and growth firms suffered massive losses on the market last year, within a month they have registered surprising gains that have questioned the pessimistic sentiment emanating from several quarters. For instance, while Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares were among the worst performers of 2022, year to date, the stock has appreciated by a massive 86%. Yet, Tesla isn't the only company making waves on the market. Two others, namely Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) lost more than half of their market capitalization last year. But lo and behold, as we settle into 2023, the duo's shares are up by 47% and 51%, respectively. Quite a turnaround if you ask us, but still a long way to go to retake previous heights.For the market as a whole, there are two key questions - both tightly related - that are on everyone's minds. 2022 was marked by the Federal Reserve's all out approach to battle inflation. This fight, fueled by rising interest rates, generates worries that the economy might head into a recession. So a debate on recession and interest rates continues to rage, and even investment banks have picked their sides. For instance, while The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that a recession can be avoided, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is of the opinion that it is possible one will strike the economy later this year. Another optimist among us is President Joe Biden, who in a fresh interview given to PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff, shared that not only does he not see a recession this year, but next year as well. President Biden simply responded to a question asking his thoughts on a recession this year by stating:No. Or next year. From the moment I got elected, how many of the experts are saying within the next six months is going to be recession?Story continuesHowever, analysts at the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) would like to disagree with the President. Not only do they believe that a recession is highly likely this year, but their strategy to deal with the uncertain economic outlook entails investing in bonds for the first half of this year and then switching to equities later on. The financial firm's sentiment on recession is as follows:A recession is all but inevitable in the U.S., Euro Area and UK: Expect a mild U.S. recession in the first half of 2023 with a risk that it starts later. Europe likely sees recession this winter [2022] with a shallow recovery thereafter as real incomes and likely overtightening pressure demand.Yet, since it's a sell side firm, Bank of America still has its favorite pick of stocks, and out of these, some of the best performing ones in 2023 so far are Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.Clare Trachtman: Good morning. and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almedia, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results, along with our financial outlook for 2023. With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023, new product development, the potential impact of recently announced strategic actions, proposed pricing actions, business development and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.And of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website. On the call this morning, we will be discussing operational sales growth which for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and the acquisition of Hillrom.Story continuesNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?JosÃ© Almeida: Thank you, Clare and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. I will begin with a brief overview of Baxter's performance for the quarter and year and then provide some additional information on the strategic road map we announced on January 6. These actions, further outlined in this morning's press release, will help Baxter to emerge as a more agile, innovative market responsive enterprise with expanded opportunities to create long-term shareholder value. Jay will follow with a deeper dive on our 2022 results and outlook for 2023 and we will close with Q&amp;A. Starting with our financial results. Sales for the fourth quarter 2022 were $3.9 billion, growing 11% on a reported basis, 17% at constant currency and 2% on an operational basis.Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.88 came in below our expectations, primarily driven by foreign exchange losses and product mix in the quarter. For the full year sales of $15.1 billion advanced 18% on a reported basis, 23% at constant currency and 2% on an operational basis. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $3.50. Jay will provide more granularity on the numbers but some themes are clear. Demand across our portfolio remains solid and sales rose across the majority of our legacy Baxter and Hillrom businesses, offsetting modest or expected declines in others, driven by factors such as generic competition or challenging year-over-year comparisons. As we've discussed previously, this top line growth was offset by weighing of macroeconomic and supply chain factors that has continued to put pressure on the cost of doing business.And as I have stressed many times, we will never pursue reduced costs in ways that could compromise our fundamental mission to save and sustain lives. But even factoring in these headwinds, we did not perform at the level we expected and demand of ourselves. And our ability to advance our mission is grounded, first and foremost, in our capacity to deliver steady, solid performance as a sustainable corporate enterprise. This is precisely why, earlier this year, we announced plans to accelerate our transformation journey, the actions we announced on January 6 and are expanding on today are as necessary as they are timely. As I shared in January, we spent the latter part of 2022 undertaking a comprehensive review of our operations focused keenly on opportunities to improve our commercial responsiveness, reinvigorate our innovation engine and streamline our operations.This work led to last month's announcement of our intention to spin off a new kidney care company, explore options for our BioPharma Solutions contract manufacturing business and implement a new operating model for our remaining Baxter businesses. These are 3 distinct initiatives with a single agenda, increase stakeholder impact with improved long-term shareholder value. Cutting across these actions are common goals, enhancing refining strategic clarity, increased accountability and line of sight, enhance agility and bring our global businesses even closer to the patients, clinicians and customers they serve. Today, I will share the next level of detail on the Baxter business model, we expect to begin implementing next quarter. This work entails a fundamental reconfiguration of how we operate and deliver products to the customers and markets we serve.This new operating model is focused on 4 vertically integrated global business units, or GBUs, grouped along general therapeutic areas encompassing multiple sites of care. These GBUs which will become Baxter's core operating and reporting segments when implemented, include medical products and therapies, comprising our current Medication Delivery, Advanced Surgery and Clinical Nutrition portfolios. Healthcare Systems and Technologies comprising our legacy. Hillrom businesses, including Patient Support Systems, Global Surgical Solutions and Front Line Care, pharmaceuticals which will include our current pharma portfolio as well as our BioPharma Solutions business until its potential separation. And finally, Kidney Care comprising our current Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses to reiterate our intention subject to satisfaction of customary conditions used to spin Kidney Care into an independent publicly traded company in the next 12 to 18 months.Until then, this GBU will benefit from the strategic work we are doing right now helping to hone a well-focused and streamlined entity in preparation for its anticipated launch as a stand-alone company. In this way, we can think of Baxter as having 4 GBU structure, or perhaps a 3 plus 1 GBU structure once the model is in place later this year. Each new GBU will have its own President, reporting directly to me. Each will have full global P&amp;L accountability. We will begin to realign our current 3 region global commercial structures. So the global commercial teams will report directly into each GBU. The dedicated R&amp;D manufacturing and supply chain and functional support teams will also be embedded by GBU to optimize visibility and oversight. This restructure is designed to generate more direct, clear accountability across each business and promote more agile decision-making across sales, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and innovation.So what you see upon completion of this process is that each of the GBUs will have more autonomy and agility than the current businesses do today. GBUs will be able to respond to market dynamics faster, more effectively, accelerate commercial investments, design and produce products and prioritize R&amp;D spending, all to help meet critical market needs and accelerate business performance. From a manufacturing perspective, Baxter will become more nimble with manufacturing sites mapped directly to each GBU leading to an optimized manufacturing footprint in a more resilient supply chain. Preparation for the new operating model is already surfacing opportunities for streamlining and efficiency that are intended to further bolster bottom line performance.The redesign being contemplated, coupled with additional actions the company has undertaken to enhance performance, are expect to deliver more than $300 million in total savings during 2023 and a workforce reduction of less than 5%. We plan to begin implementing our new operating model early in the second quarter. Looking ahead to 2023. More broadly, we expect to continue navigating a challenging operational environment, hand-in-hand with our transformation effort. We have been taking a hard look at our forecasting models and processes as we reflect on our performance last year and the lessons learned in an era of unprecedented macroeconomic challenges. We have taken the stance of incorporating more financial downside risks into our financial outlook for 2023.Jay will provide additional details on our outlook and various assumptions included. Before I pass it out to Jay, I want to close by reinforcing my confidence and optimism for the future in our commitment to continue to maintain the important work we do every day. Baxter holds a fundamental place in global health care, with a durable portfolio of essential products, market-leading position and passionate employees who bring our mission to life. We're setting out on a well-considered plan to redefine our operations and potential in pursuit of incremental long-term value for the stakeholders and shareholders that rely on us. 2023 now becomes a pivotal year. We are on our way to creating -- to leading health care companies with robust portfolios and strong market momentum.We look forward to sharing our progress and performance in the quarters to come. With that, I'll pass it over to Jay.James Saccaro: Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. Despite in line sales results, our fourth quarter earnings performance came in below our expectations. This variance was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses and product mix in the quarter. As Joe mentioned, we're not satisfied with our results and as such, we're taking a number of actions to improve our performance. Some of these initiatives are already underway and will be further enhanced with the cost reduction program that we are in the process of finalizing, in parallel with our operating model redesign. These actions are necessary and are expected to accelerate future performance. Collectively, these actions are expected to deliver more than $300 million in savings in 2023.Turning to our financial performance. Fourth quarter 2022 global sales of $3.9 billion, advanced 11% on a reported basis, 17% on a constant currency basis and 2% operationally. Sales performance in the quarter continues to underscore the strength of our broad portfolio of core therapy and connected care offerings across the care continuum. As we've discussed previously, supply for select products remains constrained and we estimate that these constraints impacted our revenues by approximately $50 million in the quarter or approximately 140 basis points. These supply constraints are a mixture of electromechanical components and shortages from other third-party suppliers. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings decreased 15% to $0.88 per share outside our guidance range of $0.92 to $0.99 per share.As mentioned earlier, this was due to unfavorable product mix and an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange losses on balance sheet positions, primarily due to the devaluation of the Russian ruble during the quarter. Now, I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories. Note that constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, in Baxter's 3 legacy geographic regions. Starting with sales by operating segment. Sales in the Americas were flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 5% on a constant currency basis and sales in our APAC region increased 2% constant currency. Quarterly sales in the region reflected strength in geographic segment sales offset by relatively flat growth in China due to the impact from various government-based procurement initiatives being implemented in that market.Moving on to performance by key product category. Global sales for Renal were $981 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by solid growth in our PD business, where we observed an increase in PD patients globally, particularly in the U.S. which saw a sequential improvement in growth of 100 basis points and ended the year with patient growth of approximately 4%. Mid-single-digit PD growth in the quarter benefited from incremental revenues of nearly $20 million, resulting from a customer that was looking to build out a new business and did not meet its contractual minimum purchase requirements. This arrangement has been terminated and the related revenues will not recur in future periods. Performance in the quarter was partially offset by lower in-center HD sales due to HD monitor and associated consumable component supply challenges.Care, Health, BeautyPhoto by Christopher Boswell on UnsplashSales in Medication Delivery of $745 million declined 2% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was affected by a difficult comparison to the prior year which benefited from higher levels of infusion pump placements. Demand remains strong for Baxter's smart infusion pumps and as we have discussed, is currently outpacing our ability to supply, given continued challenges sourcing components. Our IV therapy portfolio grew low single digits globally, driven by strong demand internationally. During the quarter, we did not see pronounced impact from flu-related cases which, although reported case numbers were high, did not translate into increased hospital admissions. Pharmaceutical sales of $552 million declined 1% on a constant currency basis.Performance in the quarter reflects the continued impact of generic competition in the U.S. which was partially offset by increased demand for our drug compounding portfolio internationally. Moving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $243 million, increasing 6% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by demand for our broad multi-chamber bags and vitamins product portfolio. Sales in Advanced Surgery were $260 million, advancing 8% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter reflects an improvement of electric procedures globally. Surgical volume recovery was strong across all regions. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $182 million, declining 3% on a constant currency basis and reflecting a tough comparison to the prior year, where we had experienced elevated demand for CRRT given the rise in COVID cases.BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $153 million, increasing 12% on a constant currency basis. Demand for non-COVID services more than offset the decline in COVID vaccine-related revenue compared to the same period last year. COVID vaccine sales for the quarter totaled $22 million. Legacy Hillrom contributed $734 million in sales in the quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year period after the acquisition closed on December 13, 2021. Hillrom sales included $360 million of sales in Patient Support Systems, $293 million of sales in Front Line Care and $81 million of sales in Global Surgical Solutions. Legacy Hillrom sales grew mid-single digits on a pro forma and FX-neutral basis as compared to Q4 2021. This growth reflects demand for the physical assessment and cardiology portfolios within the Front Line Care business.Within the quarter, we were able to secure some additional electromechanical components on the spot market which enabled us to address a portion of the backlog associated with the Front Line Care business. Sales in Patient Support Systems declined low single digits in the quarter, primarily driven by lower rental revenues in the quarter as the prior year period benefited from more than $10 million in sales due to COVID-related rentals. Moving through the rest of the P&amp;L. Adjusted gross margin of 41.6% decreased 270 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting increased cost of goods sold, primarily driven by the factors we've discussed around inflation, freight and supply chain constraints. Adjusted SG&amp;A of $797 million represented 20.5 as a percentage of sales, an increase of 30 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the addition of Hillrom as well as higher freight expenses.Adjusted R&amp;D spending in the quarter of $157 million represented 4% of sales, an increase of 10 basis points versus prior year. Both SG&amp;A and adjusted R&amp;D reflected a benefit from lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans which are directly tied to Baxter's performance. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin in the quarter of 17.1%, a decrease of 310 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net interest expense totaled $117 million in the quarter, an increase of $73 million versus the prior year, driven by higher outstanding debt balances related to the acquisition of Hillrom and the impact of interest rates on the variable rate debt. Adjusted other nonoperating expense totaled $12 million in the quarter, a decrease of $9 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by amortization of pension benefits.As I mentioned earlier, nonoperating expenses were unfavorable to our expectations primarily due to foreign exchange losses. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16.1% compared to 18.6% in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by statute expirations on certain tax positions, partially offset by an increase due to a change in geographic earnings mix following the Hillrom acquisition. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.88 per share declined 15% versus the prior year period. Earnings in the quarter reflected the increase of cost of raw materials, freight and labor as well as the impact of rising interest rates and foreign exchange headwinds. Turning to full year 2022. Sales of $15.1 billion increased by 18% on a reported basis, 23% on a constant currency basis and 2% operationally.Legacy Hillrom's Front Line Care, Patient Support Systems and Global Surgical Solutions businesses contributed $2.9 billion to full year sales on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis and after adjusting for foreign exchange, full year legacy Hillrom sales were flat as compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the impact of supply constraints for electromechanical components. On the bottom line, Baxter's adjusted earnings decreased 3% to $3.50 per diluted share, reflecting the impacts we just highlighted. On a full year basis, we generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $532 million. Throughout 2022, we remain focused on debt repayment following our Hillrom acquisition with 900 million paid boards deleveraging.We also returned approximately $600 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As we execute on our strategic actions outlined in the beginning of 2023, we are first and foremost committed to meaningfully improving our cash flow generation. Our priorities for cash deployment are focused on accelerating debt repayment, maintaining our dividend and resuming share repurchases over time. We are also actively pursuing strategic alternatives for our BioPharma Solutions business, while continuing to assess additional inorganic growth factors for products, therapies and connected care platforms for our new streamlined operations. As we progress towards the proposed spin-off of Kidney Care company, we'll look to utilize proceeds from these actions to accelerate Baxter's debt repayment schedule.We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating profile, including taking actions towards achieving our previously stated commitment to achieve 2.75x net leverage. Although current business conditions might challenge our ability to satisfy that commitment, by the end of 2024, we do expect to make significant progress towards achieving the target during 2023 and 2024. Additionally, given the proposed spin-off and potential sale of BPS, we expect to provide additional information regarding our forward-looking outlook for both Baxter RemainCo and KidneyCo at a Capital Markets Day prior to completion of the proposed spin-off. Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023, including some key assumptions underpinning our guidance.On the top line, 2023 is expected to benefit from underlying volume growth, the pricing actions taken last year as well as new product launches across our GBUs. Some of these new planned product introductions include more than 5 injectable drug launches, a next-gen ICU bed, ExactaMix Pro, Nutrition Compounder, continued rollout of our Novum IQ LVP and syringe pump in Canada and launch of the Novum IQ syringe pump in the U.S. At this time, our 2023 guidance does not contemplate any U.S. revenues for the Novum IQ large-volume infusion pump. We anticipate submission of our final responses to FDA within the quarter. We continue to be very excited about the prospect of this launch and the benefits it offers our customers. Our objective remains to launch this pump in 2023.Throughout 2022, demand for our products and therapies remained solid but supply chain challenges impacted our ability to fully supply this demand. We experienced record levels of backorders and backlog, particularly for the legacy Hillrom business. And while we observed positive development and supply availability in the fourth quarter of 2022, we currently anticipate component availability will remain challenging and will continue to hamper top line sales in 2023. We are working relentlessly to secure components and address order backlog and our expectation is that supply for electromechanical components will improve in the second half of the year. As Joe outlined, we're implementing a series of changes across our organization that are designed to meaningfully simplify the operating model and manufacturing footprint drive strategic clarity, improve operational efficiencies and accelerate future growth.In addition to consolidating our operations into 4 vertically integrated global business units, we're also evaluating additional strategic actions, including potential product line and country exits to better position the company for more profitable growth over the mid to long term These exits are expected to reduce sales by more than $100 million as compared to full year '22. Lastly, as it relates to the top line 2022 results, included approximately $140 million of sales that are not expected to repeat in 2023 as well as the benefit of approximately $50 million due to lower customer rebate costs, this includes lower COVID vaccine revenue of approximately $100 million and 2 contractual payments which benefited Renal Care sales by approximately $40 million in the second half of 2022.Moving on to dynamics impacting the rest of the P&amp;L. First, I want to point out a couple of factors that are impacting our 2023 performance as compared to 2022, such as higher annual incentive compensation payments for employees, increased interest expense and a higher tax rate assumption. In addition, while we see some improvement in the external macro environment, with select indices coming down from the peaks seen last year, our cost base is still elevated relative to historic norms. As such, cost of goods sold is expected to be a headwind compared to 2022. This is due to the rollout in the first half of 2023 of manufacturing-related costs capitalized into inventory in the second half of 2022 as well as a challenging comparison to the first half of 2022 prior to the start of significant increases in inflation.We expect the impact from these inflationary pressures to begin to ease in the second half of the year. Also, as mentioned earlier, in response to the significant macro challenges the company has experienced over the last 2 years, we will be implementing a cost reduction program in parallel with our operating model redesign that is expected to be finalized later this quarter. This initiative and additional actions the company has undertaken to enhance performance are expected to deliver more than $300 million in total savings during 2023. These savings are expected to increase over the course of the year, with the majority of the savings being realized in the second half of the year. The lower cost of goods, coupled with the increased savings, are expected to drive meaningful margin expansion and earnings growth in the second half of the year as compared to the first half.We also expect the impact from foreign exchange to lessen in the second half of the year. Finally, as Joe mentioned, with respect to our outlook for 2023, we biased our guidance towards capturing additional potential downside risks. We recognize that our performance last year disappointed investors and us alike. While we are confident the actions we are undertaking will set us on force for improved performance longer term, we have recognized that 2023 will be a transition year on our path to achieving this objective. Incorporating all of these factors, I'll now walk through our guidance and expectations. For full year 2023, we expect global sales growth of 1% to 2% on a reported basis and flat to 1% growth on a constant currency basis. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to be between 15% and 16%.Interest expense is expected to total approximately $540 million which reflects pass and potential future rate increases and adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% and a diluted average share count of 508 million shares. Based on these dynamics, we expect 2023 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.75 to $2.95 per diluted share. Specific to the first quarter of 2023, we expect global sales to decline by approximately 3% on a reported basis and approximately 1% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.46 to $0.50 per diluted share. With that, we can now open the call up for Q&amp;A. See also 35 Most Expensive Countries in the World and 10 Most Advanced Countries in Battery Technology.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Johnson &amp; Johnson in FocusJohnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is headquartered in New Brunswick, and is in the Medical sector. The stock has seen a price change of -8.63% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.13 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.8%. In comparison, the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield is 2.41%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.58%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $4.52 is up 1.6% from last year. In the past five-year period, Johnson &amp; Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.91%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Johnson &amp; Johnson's payout ratio is 44%, which means it paid out 44% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.JNJ is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $10.50 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 3.45%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, JNJ is a compelling investment opportunity.

155,6a2f8a87-7093-3ec4-b634-bc956565eec1,MOS,2023-02-11,Bank of America’s 15 Stock Picks for 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-america-15-stock-picks-194919539.html,1676058559,STORY,"['BAC', 'AMP', 'MOS', 'AMZN', 'FOXA', 'PHM', 'CHWY', 'MTCH', 'TOL', 'AMAT', 'CMG', 'WDC', 'TSLA']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Bank of America's Top 15 Stock Picks for 2023. For more top stocks, head on over to Bank of America's 5 Stock Picks for 2023. 2023 is turning out to be an interesting year for the stock market. After major technology and growth firms suffered massive losses on the market last year, within a month they have registered surprising gains that have questioned the pessimistic sentiment emanating from several quarters. For instance, while Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares were among the worst performers of 2022, year to date, the stock has appreciated by a massive 86%. Yet, Tesla isn't the only company making waves on the market. Two others, namely Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) lost more than half of their market capitalization last year. But lo and behold, as we settle into 2023, the duo's shares are up by 47% and 51%, respectively. Quite a turnaround if you ask us, but still a long way to go to retake previous heights.For the market as a whole, there are two key questions - both tightly related - that are on everyone's minds. 2022 was marked by the Federal Reserve's all out approach to battle inflation. This fight, fueled by rising interest rates, generates worries that the economy might head into a recession. So a debate on recession and interest rates continues to rage, and even investment banks have picked their sides. For instance, while The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that a recession can be avoided, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is of the opinion that it is possible one will strike the economy later this year. Another optimist among us is President Joe Biden, who in a fresh interview given to PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff, shared that not only does he not see a recession this year, but next year as well. President Biden simply responded to a question asking his thoughts on a recession this year by stating:No. Or next year. From the moment I got elected, how many of the experts are saying within the next six months is going to be recession?Story continuesHowever, analysts at the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) would like to disagree with the President. Not only do they believe that a recession is highly likely this year, but their strategy to deal with the uncertain economic outlook entails investing in bonds for the first half of this year and then switching to equities later on. The financial firm's sentiment on recession is as follows:A recession is all but inevitable in the U.S., Euro Area and UK: Expect a mild U.S. recession in the first half of 2023 with a risk that it starts later. Europe likely sees recession this winter [2022] with a shallow recovery thereafter as real incomes and likely overtightening pressure demand.Yet, since it's a sell side firm, Bank of America still has its favorite pick of stocks, and out of these, some of the best performing ones in 2023 so far are Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC).Bank of America's 15 Stock Picks for 2023Copyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We scoured the Internet to find out which stocks are Bank Of America's favorite picks for 2023.

162,23628589-fe7f-3125-8a16-47653a7dd2e6,SO,2023-02-11,Earnings Preview: CenterPoint Energy (CNP) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-centerpoint-energy-cnp-150003581.html,1676041203,STORY,"['CNP', 'SO']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when CenterPoint Energy (CNP) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy delivery company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.4%.Revenues are expected to be $2.29 billion, down 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CenterPoint?For CenterPoint, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.14%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CenterPoint will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CenterPoint would post earnings of $0.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.32, delivering a surprise of +3.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CenterPoint doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Southern Co. (SO) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.24 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -33.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.09 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Southern Co. has been revised 3.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.55%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southern Co. will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Global Insurance Companies by Market Cap.Insurance is one of the largest economic sectors in the global economy, with 105 insurers making it to the Forbes Global 2000 List in 2022. According to McKinsey, the pandemic had a substantial impact on the insurance industry: premium growth, which was more than 4% per year between 2010 and 2020, slowed to around 1.2% in 2020. At the same time, profits also declined by 15%.The industry recovered in 2021, with the Allianz Global Insurance reporting that premiums increased by 5.1% worldwide during the year. The sector’s total assets, as reported by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, stood at $44 trillion in 2021 against liabilities of $38 trillion. In 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its impact on oil and gas prices, extreme drought in food-producing parts of the world, and high inflation were all factors that affected consumer decisions about insurance. Although the final numbers are not out yet, Allianz has predicted global insurance premiums to increase by 4.8% in 2022.Biggest Global Insurance Companiesaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashThere are three main segments in the insurance industry: Life, Property and Casualty, and Health.

As per a 2021 ranking, Assicurazioni Generali was the leader in life insurance, while Allianz Insurance was the leader for non-life insurance in the European market.According to KPMG, Asia Pacific markets accounted for more than 25% of worldwide premium income in 2021, driven by double-digit growth in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Rising income levels have increased awareness about insurance, and the growth of digital sales channels also allows the insurance sector to expand in Asia Pacific markets. Last year, the Indian insurer Life Insurance Corporation entered the Fortune 500 Global, demonstrating the potential of emerging Asian markets.Story continuesIn the USA, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, 47% of the total premiums came from life/annuity, and the rest was generated by property &amp; casualty.

(NYSE:TEL) Looks Interesting, And It's About To Pay A Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/te-connectivity-ltd-nyse-tel-121819965.html,1676117899,STORY,['TEL'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase TE Connectivity's shares before the 16th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.56 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.24 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, TE Connectivity has a trailing yield of approximately 1.7% on its current stock price of $129.79. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether TE Connectivity can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see TE Connectivity paying out a modest 31% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 40% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that TE Connectivity's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see TE Connectivity's earnings per share have risen 10% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, TE Connectivity has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpHas TE Connectivity got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that TE Connectivity is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about TE Connectivity, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while TE Connectivity has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for TE Connectivity you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

167,67dac622-a0ac-395e-b8d1-2f071c052aa4,NOC,2023-02-11,"Top Stock Reports for SAP, Northrop Grumman & TC Energy",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-stock-reports-sap-northrop-215909852.html,1676066349,STORY,"['NOC', 'TRP', 'SAP', 'MGM', 'EXR', 'NUE']","[Friday, February 10, 2023The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including SAP SE (SAP), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) and TC Energy Corp. (TRP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of SAP have declined -1.4% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s decline of -9.7%. The company’s performance is affected due to continued softness in software licenses and the support business segment, coupled with supply chain constraints, global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability. Also, increasing research &amp; development and sales &amp; marketing expenses to cope with intensifying competition in the cloud space are concerns.However, SAP’s Q1 performance benefited from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new ""Rise with SAP"" solution) across all regions. There is momentum in SAP’s business technology platform, particularly the S/4HANA solutions.The company’s restructuring plan is expected to better align its operating models and go-to-market approach with its accelerated cloud transformation. Frequent product launches like SAP Build and strategic collaborations bode well.(You can read the full research report on SAP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Northrop Grumman’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. -8.1%). The company continues to witness strong demand for its products, driven by programs like F-35, Triton and SABR radar Global Hawk. Solid U.S. budgetary provisions make the analyst confident about a solid contract inflow from the Pentagon. Northrop also holds a strong solvency position.However, a comparative analysis of the stock’s trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture. The prolonged impact of COVID-19 may cause extended disruptions in its supply chain. High inflation rates across the U.S. might also hurt the stock. It expects further impacts related to the conflict in Ukraine and economic sanctions imposed on Russia.(You can read the full research report on Northrop Grumman here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Calgary, Alberta-based TC Energy have underperformed the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry over the past year (-22.1% vs. +4.0%). The company is witnessing continued timing and cost overrun issues over large construction projects, plus the cancellation of Keystone XL, are major overhangs.Story continuesMoreover, further share price appreciation will likely be tied to the progress on its debt reduction front, which sits at a massive C$40.92 billion. Therefore, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.Nevertheless, TC Energy is predominantly a natural gas pipeline operator, with operations spanning Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. A quality stock with industry-leading wide-moat assets, TC Energy has a secured portfolio of C$34 billion in growth projects.This should support the company’s stated dividend growth commitment of 3-5% annually in the future. TC Energy’s takeover of its TC Pipelines unit last year has helped it to improve corporate governance and lower the cost of capital.(You can read the full research report on TC Energy here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Nucor Corp.

(EXR) and MGM Resorts International (MGM).Mark VickerySenior EditorNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

168,26486d0e-e46d-3a6b-a2ad-098a40c2af53,NOC,2023-02-11,General Dynamics (GD) Wins Submarine Repair Support Deal,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-gd-wins-submarine-115411750.html,1676030051,STORY,"['GD', 'NOC', 'HII', 'BAESY']","[General Dynamics Corp.’s GD business segment, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract for continued maintenance and repair support at Naval Submarine Base New London, CT. The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $13.9 million, the contract is projected to be completed by June 2023. Work related to this deal will be executed in Groton, CT.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly due to upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features. To this end, military submarines and other defense ships with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form an integral part of any nation’s defense system.Therefore, the increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics with its Electric Boat business unit being the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs. The unit has established standards of excellence in the design, construction and lifecycle support of submarines for the U.S. Navy. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Looking ahead, General Dynamics is investing $1.8 billion of capital in expanded and modernized facilities at Electric Boat to support growth in submarine construction. It expects to substantially complete the investments by the end of 2023. Such investments are expected to enhance Electric Boat’s capability in submarine construction as well as provide lifecycle support for the same, which should enable it to win more contracts in the future.Peer MovesNations are reinforcing their defense capabilities to deter any warfare-like situation. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% between 2022 and 2031. This indicates ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the military submarine space.A few defense primes that can reap the benefits of the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.Story continuesBAE Systems’ Astute class submarines are the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines and can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.The long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is 13.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAE Systems’ 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 32.1%.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter the increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. Northrop Grumman also provides launch systems for submarines. Its eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%. NOC delivered an average earnings surprise of 3.35% in the last four quarters.Huntington Ingalls is another renowned submarine builder in the United States, with its division, Newport News being one of the only two U.S. shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines. Newport News is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HII’s 2022 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 8.8%. Huntington Ingalls delivered an average earnings surprise of 7.59% in the last four quarters.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past year, shares of GD have gained 7% against the industry’s decline of 8.1%.

172,61a4d825-05c9-385a-afd0-36d740c96672,VFC,2023-02-11,V.F (NYSE:VFC) Is Reducing Its Dividend To $0.30,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-nyse-vfc-reducing-123914129.html,1676119154,STORY,['VFC'],"[V.F. Corporation's (NYSE:VFC) dividend is being reduced from last year's payment covering the same period to $0.30 on the 21st of March. The dividend yield of 4.6% is still a nice boost to shareholder returns, despite the cut. View our latest analysis for V.F V.F's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, the dividend made up 188% of earnings, and the company was generating negative free cash flows. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating free cash flows is a major warning sign for the sustainability of the dividend as these levels are certainly a bit high.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 57%, which is in a comfortable range for us.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.72 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.20. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.2% per annum over that time. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. It's encouraging to see that V.F has been growing its earnings per share at 9.7% a year over the past five years. However, the company isn't reinvesting a lot back into the business, so we would expect the growth rate to slow down somewhat in the future.V.F's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableIn summary, dividends being cut isn't ideal, however it can bring the payment into a more sustainable range. In general, the distributions are a little bit higher than we would like, but we can't ignore the fact the quickly growing earnings gives this stock great potential in the future. We don't think V.F is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've identified 4 warning signs for V.F (2 are a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for CIBINQO® (abrocitinib), expanding its indication to include adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years) with refractory, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products, including biologics, or when use of those therapies is inadvisable. CIBINQO was previously approved only for the treatment of adults 18 years and older.""This is a meaningful advancement for the many adolescents across the U.S. who are affected by the persistent itching and discomfort that accompanies uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,"" said Lawrence Eichenfield, MD, Chief of Pediatric and Adolescent Dermatology at Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego. ""The extended indication of CIBINQO offers potential relief for young atopic dermatitis patients in need and their families.""The CIBINQO prescribing information was updated to include data from JADE TEEN, a Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. JADE TEEN, which supported the expanded indication, evaluated both the 100 mg and 200 mg doses of CIBINQO versus placebo in adolescents 12 to &lt;18 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD while also on background therapy with topical medications. The trial evaluated measures of improvements in skin clearance, itch, disease extent, and severity, including the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS), and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).""Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis can have debilitating physical and emotional impacts on adolescents,"" said Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer, President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer. ""As an efficacious once-daily pill, we believe that CIBINQO offers an important new treatment option for adolescents burdened by uncontrolled symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Encouraged by an increasing uptake in the adult population, we look forward to bringing this important new oral medicine to adolescents who have yet to find relief from this inflammatory skin condition with current options.""Story continuesData from the robust clinical trial program included in the prescribing information now stems from five randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and a long-term extension study with more than 1,600 patients treated with CIBINQO. Across the trials to date, CIBINQO demonstrated a consistent safety profile and profound improvements in skin clearance, extent of disease, and severity as well as rapid improvement in itch after two weeks, for some people living with AD versus placebo, including adolescents.Across trials, the most common adverse events reported in ≥1% of patients treated with CIBINQO for up to 16 weeks included nasopharyngitis (12.4% with CIBINQO 100 mg, 8.7% with CIBINQO 200 mg, and 7.9% with placebo), nausea (6%, 14.5%, and 2.1%, respectively), and headache (6%, 7.8%, and 3.5%, respectively).Additional Details on the JADE TEEN Clinical TrialJADE TEEN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. A total of 285 individuals 12 to &lt;18 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were randomized to receive once-daily abrocitinib 200 mg, abrocitinib 100 mg, or placebo for 12 weeks while also on background topical therapy. Eligible subjects completing the 12-week treatment period of the study had the option to enter a long-term extension (LTE) study, B7451015. The trial assessed the co-primary endpoints of IGA 0 or 1 and EASI-75 responses at Week 12.Select findings from JADE TEEN are as follows:IGA 0 or 1 Response Rate (Week 12): 39% with CIBINQO 100 mg, 46% with CIBINQO 200 mg, and 24% with placeboEASI-75 Response Rate (Week 12): 64%, 71%, and 41%, respectivelyProportion of participants achieving PP-NRS at least a 4-point decrease from baseline (Week 2): 13%, 25%, and 8%, respectivelySafety profile seen in JADE TEEN was consistent with the pivotal trials and findings for the adult populationAbout CIBINQO® (abrocitinib)CIBINQO is an oral inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) 1. Inhibition of JAK1 is thought to modulate multiple cytokines involved in pathophysiology of AD, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).To date, CIBINQO has received marketing authorization in the U.S., the European Union, Great Britain, and other countries, and has launched in Germany, Japan, China, and ≥20 other markets worldwide.About Atopic DermatitisAD is a chronic skin disease characterized by inflammation of the skin and skin barrier defects.1,2 Most people know AD is a skin condition, but many don’t realize it can be caused in part by an abnormal immune response beneath the skin. This dysregulated immune response is thought to contribute to inflammation within the skin and the signs of AD on the surface. Lesions of AD are characterized by erythema (red/pink or discolored skin patches, depending on normal skin color), itching, lichenification (thick/leathery skin), induration (hardening)/papulation (formulation of papules), and oozing/crusting.1,2AD is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, affecting approximately 5-10% of adults in the U.S. and approximately 11% of children in the U.S.1,2,3,4,5 Approximately 1 in 3 adults and 1 in 3 children and adolescents, 17 and under, with AD have moderate-to-severe disease.6,7U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MORTALITY, MALIGNANCY, MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, AND THROMBOSISSerious InfectionsPatients treated with CIBINQO may be at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. The most frequent serious infections reported with CIBINQO were herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and pneumonia.If a serious or opportunistic infection develops, discontinue CIBINQO and control the infection.Reported infections from Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions:Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test for latent TB before and during therapy; treat latent TB prior to use. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even patients with initial negative, latent TB test.Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.Bacterial, viral (including herpes zoster), and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.Avoid use of CIBINQO in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment with CIBINQO should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infections or those who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses.Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIBINQO, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.Consider yearly screening for patients in highly endemic areas for TB. CIBINQO is not recommended for use in patients with active TB. For patients with a new diagnosis of latent TB or prior untreated latent TB, or for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who are at high risk for TB infection, start preventive therapy for latent TB prior to initiation of CIBINQO.Viral reactivation, including herpes virus reactivation (eg, herpes zoster, herpes simplex), was reported in clinical studies with CIBINQO. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider interrupting CIBINQO until the episode resolves. Hepatitis B virus reactivation has been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors. Perform viral hepatitis screening and monitoring for reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy and during therapy with CIBINQO. CIBINQO is not recommended for use in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.MORTALITYIn a large, randomized postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing another JAK inhibitor to TNF blocker treatment, a higher rate of all-cause mortality (including sudden cardiovascular death) was observed with the JAK inhibitor. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA patients.MALIGNANCIESMalignancies, including non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), were reported in patients treated with CIBINQO. Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Perform periodic skin examination for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using broad-spectrum sunscreen.In a large, randomized postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA patients. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers was observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with CIBINQO, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers.MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS (MACE)Major adverse cardiovascular events were reported in patients treated with CIBINQO. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), was observed when compared with TNF blockers. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA patients. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue CIBINQO in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with CIBINQO, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.THROMBOSISDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients treated with CIBINQO. Thrombosis, including PE, DVT, and arterial thrombosis have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed when compared with TNF blockers. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA patients.Avoid CIBINQO in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, discontinue CIBINQO and treat patients appropriately.CONTRAINDICATIONCIBINQO is contraindicated in patients taking antiplatelet therapies, except for low-dose aspirin (≤81 mg daily), during the first 3 months of treatment.LABORATORY ABNORMALITIESHematologic Abnormalities: Treatment with CIBINQO was associated with an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Prior to CIBINQO initiation, perform a complete blood count (CBC). CBC evaluations are recommended at 4 weeks after initiation and 4 weeks after dose increase of CIBINQO. Discontinuation of CIBINQO therapy is required for certain laboratory abnormalities.Lipid Elevations: Dose-dependent increase in blood lipid parameters were reported in patients treated with CIBINQO.

For more top stocks, head on over to Bank of America's 5 Stock Picks for 2023. 2023 is turning out to be an interesting year for the stock market. After major technology and growth firms suffered massive losses on the market last year, within a month they have registered surprising gains that have questioned the pessimistic sentiment emanating from several quarters. For instance, while Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares were among the worst performers of 2022, year to date, the stock has appreciated by a massive 86%. Yet, Tesla isn't the only company making waves on the market. Two others, namely Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) lost more than half of their market capitalization last year. But lo and behold, as we settle into 2023, the duo's shares are up by 47% and 51%, respectively. Quite a turnaround if you ask us, but still a long way to go to retake previous heights.For the market as a whole, there are two key questions - both tightly related - that are on everyone's minds. 2022 was marked by the Federal Reserve's all out approach to battle inflation. This fight, fueled by rising interest rates, generates worries that the economy might head into a recession. So a debate on recession and interest rates continues to rage, and even investment banks have picked their sides. For instance, while The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that a recession can be avoided, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is of the opinion that it is possible one will strike the economy later this year. Another optimist among us is President Joe Biden, who in a fresh interview given to PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff, shared that not only does he not see a recession this year, but next year as well. President Biden simply responded to a question asking his thoughts on a recession this year by stating:No. Or next year. From the moment I got elected, how many of the experts are saying within the next six months is going to be recession?Story continuesHowever, analysts at the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) would like to disagree with the President. Not only do they believe that a recession is highly likely this year, but their strategy to deal with the uncertain economic outlook entails investing in bonds for the first half of this year and then switching to equities later on. The financial firm's sentiment on recession is as follows:A recession is all but inevitable in the U.S., Euro Area and UK: Expect a mild U.S. recession in the first half of 2023 with a risk that it starts later. Europe likely sees recession this winter [2022] with a shallow recovery thereafter as real incomes and likely overtightening pressure demand.Yet, since it's a sell side firm, Bank of America still has its favorite pick of stocks, and out of these, some of the best performing ones in 2023 so far are Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC).Bank of America's 15 Stock Picks for 2023Copyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We scoured the Internet to find out which stocks are Bank Of America's favorite picks for 2023.

The payment provider’s decision comes after Paxos, a stablecoin developer that has previously partnered with Binance and Mastercard, was reported on Thursday by CoinDesk to be in the crosshairs of the New York Department of Financial Services, a niche branch of state government and a key player among U.S. cryptocurrency regulators. Reasons for the investigation were unclear.When asked for comment, a spokesperson for PayPay told Fortune that the company was “exploring a stablecoin.”“If and when we seek to move forward, we will, of course, work closely with relevant regulators,” the spokesperson said.A spokesperson for Paxos did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. A spokesperson for the Department of Financial Services declined to comment on ongoing investigations.A pause on PayPal’s stablecoin development follows a suite of recent regulatory action against crypto companies. That acceleration prompted it to stand back from pursuing its own coin, according to an anonymous source who spoke to Bloomberg.On Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Kraken, the third largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, agreed to a $30 million fine after the government accused the exchange of selling unregistered securities through its staking business, which lets users put their cryptocurrency in escrow to help validate blockchain transactions. In exchange, token holders receive a certain percentage yield. As part of the settlement, Kraken also agreed to remove its staking feature from its platform in the U.S.Story continuesAnd in late January, Custodia, a crypto-focused bank in Wyoming, was denied membership in the Federal Reserve System, which would have let the bank make use of tax benefits, investment opportunities, and other conveniences.PayPal has made a concerted push into crypto in the past two years, allowing users to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin through its digital wallet. In January of 2022, it announced its plans to explore the development of its own stablecoin. This was before crypto behemoths like Celsius, Voyager, and most infamously FTX collapsed and went bankrupt in the following months.On Thursday, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, who presided over the company as it made its splash into crypto, announced his plans to retire at the end of 2023.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeThe 5 most common mistakes lottery winners makeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $400,000 homeThe Billionaire Tax: how much the ultra wealthy could end up paying under Biden's new plan and what it means for your tax bill]"

Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.6bUS$10.9bUS$11.2bUS$11.5bUS$11.8bUS$12.0bUS$12.3bUS$12.6bUS$12.8bUS$13.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.42%Est @ 2.32%Est @ 2.24%Est @ 2.19%Est @ 2.16%Est @ 2.13%Est @ 2.11% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.4% US$9.7kUS$9.1kUS$8.6kUS$8.0kUS$7.5kUS$7.0kUS$6.5kUS$6.1kUS$5.7kUS$5.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$74bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.4%– 2.1%) = US$182bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$182b÷ ( 1 + 9.4%)10= US$74bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$148b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$136, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Business Machines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.237. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for International Business MachinesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

The Transocean Spitsbergen rig drilled the two exploration wells.These are the third and fourth exploration wells in production license 923, awarded in APA 2017. Equinor operates the license with a 40% interest.The latest discovery is located 10 kilometers northwest of the Troll and 130 kilometers of Bergen in the northwest direction. According to preliminary estimates, the discovery holds 17-47 million barrels of recoverable oil equivalent. The majority of the discovery will likely be oil.Rover Sor marks the seventh discovery in the area since the autumn of 2019. Equinor’s other discoveries in the area are Echino Sor, Swisher, Rover Nord, Blasto, Toppand and Kveikje.Equinor and partners will consider tying the Rover Sor discovery into existing infrastructure in the Troll region. Discoveries close to the existing infrastructure are crucial to maintaining oil and gas production from the Norwegian Continental Shelf.The Troll field constitutes 40% of the total gas reserves on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Equinor operates the Troll A, B and C platforms on the field. The area’s gas reservoirs, 1,400 meters below sea level, are expected to produce for at least another 70 years.Last year, the Norway government authorized Equinor to increase production at a number of projects, including Troll.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Virginia companies and stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Virginia would be the 34th biggest country in the world with a GDP of $605 billion in 2021. This means that the state ranked higher than many advanced economies in the world including Belgium, Israel, Norway and Australia. A diverse economy in Virginia means that the biggest Virginia companies and stocks operate in various industries and are all important contributors to Virginia's GDP.Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, Virginia is the biggest defense spender in the country, spending $62.7 billion on defense in 2021, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. Surprising because Virginia has only the 12th highest population in the country and 13th by GDP. Unsurprising because some of the biggest defense companies, not just in the U.S. but in the world, are located in the state and are among its biggest companies. At 10.2%, Virginia's defense spending is also the highest in the country as a percentage of its GDP, and contributes to around 11.2% of total U.S. defense spending. In terms of number of defense personnel, it has the second highest number in the country at over 250,000.25 biggest Virginia companies and stocksNagel Photography/Shutterstock.comVirginia is also home to a large number of tech workers and according to CompTIA, is home to more than 350,000 tech workers while its concentration of tech workers, at 8.7%, is second only to Washington. In absolute terms, Virginia ranks fifth in terms of states by net tech employment after the four biggest states in the country.In November 2022, Virginia's unemployment rate was 2.8% with a civilian labor force of 4.3 million people. Despite being quite low, the state's unemployment rate has increased slightly from the previous month. However, it is still among the lowest among all the states because of which the it looks in a good state heading into economic uncertainty in 2023. According to Tom Barkin, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, while inflation is still quite high, the pace of the increase has slowed down which bodes well as a recession looks imminent.Story continuesEnsuring that businesses are able to grow and compete efficiently is important to ensure proper contribution to the state's GDP and allow for its growth which is why Virginia provides several opportunities for businesses which aim to reduce costs of either opening or expanding facilities and providing incentives to employers. In fact, according to CNBC, Virginia is the third best state for business. Incentives include discretionary incentives, infrastructure assistance and various corporate income tax credits and property tax incentives.The biggest Virginia companies and stocks have a combined revenue of $425 billion and a market cap over $525 billion.

The SUV market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% through 2027, reaching a valuation of $1.22 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.According to the report, the SUV industry is being driven by a surge in demand for luxury vehicles, particularly SUVs, due to improving economic conditions across the globe and a rise in disposable income. The report pointed out that global premium SUV production increased from 53% in 2016 to 62% in 2021. The U.S., Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea are the main drivers of the SUV market, representing over 90% of total production. Not just SUVs, these countries are also among the largest car producers in the world, no matter its class. In 2021, 75% of luxury cars produced in the U.S. were SUVs. China and India have also seen significant growth in SUV demand, with China increasing by 36% and India by 10% between 2018 and 2021.Story continuesRising global vehicle sales have prompted governments and regulatory bodies to impose stricter emission norms. This has increased the demand for electric and hybrid vehicles, resulting in more electric SUVs being launched. The report pointed out that according to statistics from the IEA, over 55% of electric car models that were announced in 2021 were SUVs and pickups. Electrification of SUVs is attractive due to their higher fuel consumption and since they have a higher price tag as compared to smaller cars, manufacturers can charge a premium and reap higher profit margins. Currently, the US has the highest electric SUV market share, while India, China, and some EU countries are recording the fastest growth.Automakers are working on bringing more large electric SUVs to market. However, large batteries and increased weight are resulting in increased costs and higher charging times. SUV sales continue to be dominated by traditional powertrains. Though some hybrid or electric models exist, advancements in battery technology are needed to make electric SUVs more popular.In 2021, the all-electric SUV market was led by Asia-Pacific, with China accounting for more than 94% of sales. In recent years, Chinese, South Korean, Japanese, and Indian carmakers have launched various electric SUVs. Future electric SUVs are expected to be more powerful due to advancements in electric powertrain, batteries, thermal management, and other power electronic modules.Furthermore, according to the report, two-row and three-row SUVs are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. While, the Americas region held the largest market share of this segment, rising adoption of three-row SUVs from APAC countries is expected to drive the growth of this segment further through the forecasted period.The SUV market is expected to continue to grow in the coming years as more consumers opt for these vehicles over other categories. Manufacturers are also continuing to invest in developing new technologies, such as hybrid and electric powertrains, to make SUVs more efficient and attractive to consumers. Some of the largest car companies in the world that are working on bringing their all-electric SUVs to the market include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).Let's now look at the 10 best three-row SUVs in 2023.10 Best Three-Row SUVs in 2023Our MethodologyTo determine the best three-row SUVs in 2023, we reviewed consensus picks from Forbes, Edmunds, Motor Trend, TrueCar, and Kelley Blue Book.

Before the pandemic struck, Georgia's unemployment rate was at a historic low of 3.1% before climbing to 12.6% in just two months when the effect of the pandemic was fully felt. Clawing this back to 3% shows the progress the state has made in recovering from the pandemic which should help it navigate economic headwinds heading into 2023.Story continuesTo encourage businesses and their growth in Georgia, which includes various tax credits that allow you to reduce tax credits and is considered to be the first state in the Southeast to use single-factor appointment, which means that the corporate tax rate will be calculated only based on sales made inside Georgia.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Massachusetts would be 32nd largest economy in the world based on a 2021 GDP of $641 billion, which makes it bigger than Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Austria. The economy of Massachusetts is strongly based on technological research and development as well as the service sector, which dictates a major switch from its preindustrial economy which was largely dependent on agriculture and maritime trade. That is not to say that agriculture isn't an important contributor as it definitely is; it's just that it isn't as significant to the state's economy as it used to be. The pharmaceutical industry has a major presence in the state as well and several of the biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks are pharma / biotech companies.Education has always been considered important in Massachusetts and this should come as no surprise considering the fact that the oldest and one of the most prestigious ranked universities in Harvard University is located in the state. In addition, the state is considered to be a pioneer in kindergarten and secondary education as well, and this historic focus on education is no double linked to the success of the state in various metrics including being among the biggest states in the country.25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocksMarcio Jose Bastos Silva/Shutterstock.comIn November 2022, the unemployment rate of Massachusetts was 3.4%, which ranks it 22nd among all U.S. states. According to Boston Indicators, Massachusetts started to drop into recession after the Covid-19 pandemic hit but posted a quick and strong recovery which was needed after unemployment increased to a record 16% in April 2020. Even in 2022, the unemployment rate has continued to drop as it was 3.9% in 2021, and over half a million jobs have been regained since 2020. However, there are still challenges remaining relating to unemployment which includes an outflux of workers, and higher unemployment for minorities.Story continuesRight now, Massachusetts is moving more slowly than other New England states as the aforementioned labor outflux has exacerbated labor supply issues while higher interest rates have negatively impacted high growth companies such as tech and research and development, which we mentioned were the main sectors in the state. On the other hand, the professional services sector, which employs the highest number of people in the state, has posted a strong recovery in 2022.To encourage growth of businesses, Massachusetts provides several tax and other benefits including tax credits for cleaning up contaminated property, credits for investing in housing development projects, tax credits for taxpayers and businesses which make cash contributions to investment projects, and the Economic Development Incentive Program Credit to create and stimulate business within Massachusetts.The 25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks have a combined revenue of $486 billion and a market cap exceeding $1.22 trillion with three companies worth more than $100 billion headquartered in the state. To determine these companies, we obtained the 25 largest companies in the state from Fortune 500 based on revenue and determined their market cap from Yahoo finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap, and where the company wasn't listed, assigned it a ranking based on revenue alone.

(NYSE:V) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 77% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-favoured-110114863.html,1676113274,STORY,['V'],"[If you want to know who really controls Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Visa, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Visa. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Visa's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Visa is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.4% of the company stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of VisaThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Visa Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$248m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 23% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Visa. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Chevron has condemned human rights abuses in the country.Myanmar's Ministry of Communication did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The U.S. company on Friday said it had agreed to sell for an undisclosed amount its 41.1% interest in the Yadana Project to a subsidiary of MTI. Yadana produces natural gas for domestic use and export to Thailand.French oil producer TotalEnergies sold its assets and left the country in July 2022.Chevron's sale follows a year-long business strategy in which it worked to reduce proceeds from the sale that would end up with the military government. Myanmar' state-controlled oil company MOGE was part of the joint venture.Before putting its Yadana stake for sale, Chevron temporarily increased its participation in the project from 28% to 41%, absorbing an interest TotalEnergies.The strategy aimed to gain greater control over the joint venture, and reduce what MOGE could make from the transaction or from the asset in the future.The military government took power in 2021, alleging fraud in a general election won by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party.

With a strong corporate fundamental backdrop in place, Texakoma is positioned to take advantage of current market opportunities in the private energy sector.Texakoma's business directives for 2023 focus on increasing its acreage position throughout Texas and Oklahoma. Asset allocation targets will include the acquisition of existing production, undeveloped acreage, and non-operated properties. With a highly skilled geological and engineering staff, decades of experience, strong oilfield relationships, and a strategic focus on directly sourcing potential opportunities, Texakoma has a market advantage over other exploration and production companies.The time is now to capitalize on what direct domestic energy opportunities offer. In a tight supply market where crude oil or natural gas production cannot keep up with global demands, prices will likely increase. JPMorgan has revised its 2023 oil forecast down to $90 per barrel, which is still higher than recent prices of $80 to $85 per barrel. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon calls for more investment in oil and gas, saying, ""We aren't getting this one right. The world needs 100 million barrels effectively of oil and gas every day. And we need it for 10 years.""

We start with the Securities and Exchange Commission taking out staking, which is the cryptocurrency practice in which unused tokens earn interest after a fixed period. It's now seeing some action from the SEC. Crypto exchange Kraken no longer offering staking after a $30 million penalty and settlement.Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has spoken out against restrictions on staking via a tweet. Those comments leading to a small rout in shares of the company because there are concerns about staking at Coinbase as well. They fell a lot more yesterday, now down a bit today.Citigroup barred from handling a major muni bond deal in Texas. This after the state's attorney general says the bank discriminates against the firearms industry. The bond deal, which is worth $3.4 billion, will help utility companies recover from a 2021 winter storm. Citigroup is, in fact, the second bank to be barred from the deal. UBS was first barred after the state said that bank boycotted the oil and gas industry.And the corporate pullback in jobs continues. News Corp set to lay off 5% of its staff after reporting lower quarterly revenue. One bright spot is the company's Dow Jones Financial Publishing Unit, which includes publications like ""The Wall Street Journal."" It was the only unit to report a revenue rise. The news the latest in a long list of companies, of course, that have recently cut costs by reducing headcount, including companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Zoom.

These VPPAs are for an aggregate of 850 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy generating capacity across seven states, of which about 71 percent is wind energy generating capacity and 29 percent is solar energy generating capacity.Included in the full allocation are two new long-term VPPAs with Apex Clean Energy for an aggregate of up to nearly 300 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity. These projects include a wind project for up to 80 MW in the ISO New England regional market, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2024, and a wind project for up to 200 MW in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) regional market, which is expected to be operational by the middle of 2024.Since 2019, Verizon has signed 26 VPPAs for nearly 3.3 gigawatts (GW) of expected renewable energy capacity. To date, seven renewable energy facilities relating to Verizon's VPPAs for an aggregate of more than 800 MW of capacity are operational.Story continuesVerizon’s portfolio of VPPAs is part of Citizen Verizon, the company’s responsible business plan for economic, environmental and social advancement.

I would now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.Story continuesJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning. Thank you, Christina and welcome everyone. As noted in our press release, we delivered record second quarter earnings despite the challenging backdrop. During the key holiday season, where brand magic, compelling product and operational excellence are required to win with consumers, we outperformed expectations. This is a direct reflection of our talented teams and the benefits of our globally diversified business model, which continue to fuel innovation and customer engagement across our portfolio. Importantly, we remained disciplined stewards of our brands, which is underscored by gross margin expansion, as well as the ongoing investments we are making to support our long-term growth agenda.Now touching on the strategic and financial highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth, delivering low single-digit constant currency revenue gains excluding greater China, which experienced incremental pressure associated with COVID. These results were led by double-digit sales increases in Europe, Japan and other Asia, which together outpaced our expectations. In North America, as expected, we realized the slight decline in revenue, amid a difficult consumer backdrop. We did this while driving higher gross margin, operating margin and profit dollars compared to both prior year and pre-pandemic levels, underscoring our commitment to brand building and operating discipline. In Greater China, sales declined 20% on a constant currency basis.This was below our expectations as we like many others experienced greater than anticipated COVID-related disruption. That said, following the change in the COVID containment policy in China, we experienced a meaningful improvement in traffic trends, driving a positive Lunar New Year performance and a solid start to the third quarter. Second, we continued to build lasting customer relationships. During the quarter, we acquired nearly 2.6 million new customers in North America alone. Importantly, these customers transacted at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, nearly half of these customers were millennial and Gen Z consistent with our strategy to attract younger consumers. We also drove higher average spend across our customer base, which included an increase in units per transaction, reflecting the rising traction of our lifestyle offering and focus on solidifying our brands as gifting destinations during the holiday season.Third, we delivered seamless omni-channel experiences harnessing the power of our direct-to-consumer business model and highlighting our ability to meet consumers where they are shopping. Excluding Greater China, we drove a low single-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales at constant currency. This was fueled by a mid single-digit growth in brick-and-mortar sales as consumers embraced a return to in-person experiences. We lean into this shift welcoming more customers to our stores around the globe, where we leveraged our expertise and world class field teams to deliver exceptional customer experiences. Given this dynamic, our digital business declined low single digits as anticipated. With that said, digital sales were 3x ahead of fiscal '19 levels, and represented one-third of total revenue, underscoring the continued importance of this channel.Next, we've continued to invest in our platform capabilities. In fact, this marks the first holiday season that all our brands were on our digital enterprise platform, which was designed to enhance engagement and simplify the customer journey. In addition, we leverage new data analytics capabilities to optimize our product allocation processes, such as utilizing artificial intelligence to forecast customer demand, and better position inventory and stores. This led to an increase of inventory availability and help to ensure our product was in the right place at the right time, as we match supply with demand to help deliver superior customer experiences. Before moving on, I want to recognize the incredible work of our teams across the organization.Their ingenuity and partnership drove our results and importantly fueled omni-channel engagement across our brands. Fourth, on a constant currency basis, we drove handbag AUR gains globally and in North America. This reflects a blend of magic and logic, our commitment to driving fashion, innovation and product excellence informed by analytics and consumer research. Together this supported our ability to drive gross margin expansion in the quarter, allowing us to capitalize on lower freight costs and drive the savings to the bottom line. Overall, we generated second quarter earnings well above expectations supported by stronger-than-anticipated margins. On a currency neutral basis, EPS rose 10%, which we accomplished despite headwinds in China, and continued investment in our platform capabilities and our brands.Building on this performance, we are raising our earnings outlook for the fiscal year, demonstrating the power of brand building and customer centricity augmented by an agile operating model and financial discipline. In addition to our financial progress, I'm proud of the work we've done to continue to advance our corporate responsibility strategy, which we're calling the fabric of change. Last month, we published our 10th annual corporate responsibility report, highlighting our progress and launching new and bolder ambitions to support an increasingly equitable and sustainable future for our business and our planet. Now turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. In the second quarter, our revenue outperformed expectations while driving an increase in operating margin to over 31%, despite facing incremental headwinds from Greater China.We advanced our strategic initiatives which fueled our results. First, we remain focused on our core leather goods as we continue to build equity in our most important families, while simultaneously introducing emotional newness into the offering. Our iconic platforms Willow, Tabby and Rogue drove our handbag performance in the quarter. Willow remain the number one handbag family with a timeless aesthetic and compelling functional silhouettes. Rogue was again a top seller with notable strength in North America at premium AUR. The Tabby collection continued to resonate with consumers led by outperformance in the core shoulder bag. We continue to animate this family introducing new colorways and fabrics including Shearling to add depth and excitement.And following its strong launch in the first quarter, Bandit, outperformed expectations and was the key recruitment vehicle with approximately 40% of shoulder bag sales coming from new customers at strong AURs. Based on the consumer demand we've seen, we are further investing behind this collection which is emerging as an iconic family. At the same time, we fueled innovation through trend right launches with a focus on appealing to younger consumers. We relaunched the Demi bag, an icon from our archives, and a blend of organic cotton and recycled polyester. We also continue to lean into the micro and mini handbag trend including our studio baguette and mini Tabby, which resonated with Gen Z consumers. These examples showcase the innovation we're delivering to translate fashion trends into our brand language.Overall, our product assortment fueled a mid-single-digit constant currency gain in handbag AUR, both globally and in North America. Importantly, our brand strength and pricing discipline helped to drive gross margin expansion in the quarter. Second, we focused our marketing investments on brand building activities to create emotional connections with consumers harnessing the brand's unique purpose. Our first Courage to be Real campaign featuring Global Ambassador, Lil Nas X, cut through with consumers with its message of confidence and authenticity. Following the launch last September, the campaign video has approximately 350 million views, and we've seen improvements in purchase consideration for Gen Z consumers per YouGov. In addition, we continue to test and learn new ways to engage consumers on digital channels in keeping with our multifaceted marketing strategy designed to increase customer lifetime value.For example, we utilized an array of YouTube shorts to deliver high-impact brand and product stories. As a result of these efforts and our innovative product offering, we acquired nearly 1.5 million new Coach customers in North America alone. Importantly, these customers entered the brand at a higher AUR than the balance. Third, we drove double-digit top line gains in our lifestyle offering at constant currency, an area of long-term opportunity for the brand. In footwear, outsized growth was led by trend-right styles, including the Leah Loafer and the Men's Low Line sneaker as well as boots and booties across genders. In men's, revenue growth was fueled by our core leather goods families, notably the Gotham, League, Charter and Hitch. And in ready-to-wear, we continue to see success in both men's and women's styles featuring iconic branding across outerwear, including puffers with Signature C as well as our cut and so gifting items adorned with Rexy, our brand's favorite mascot.Fourth, we focused on creating omni-channel experiences that resonate with consumers by communicating our brand's purpose of self-expression. We launched an array of in-person experiences, including a one-of-a-kind Coach Mart in Japan inspired by the region's iconic local convenience stores. At the end of December, our collaboration was a beloved White Rabbit candy brand debut in China in anticipation of the Lunar New Year holiday, celebrating the year of the rabbit. We amplified this multi-category collaboration through exciting activations and including an experiential event at the Bund in Shanghai. We are also connecting with new customer segments through immersive online environments and high-impact content to allow Coach's physical world to have greater reach.This included partnerships with digital artists, 3D installations and high-profile physical retail locations and hyper-local mobile games. In closing, we delivered a solid holiday quarter, highlighted by margin expansion despite the challenging backdrop. Our success is rooted in our strategy of bringing expressive luxury to life through a clear understanding of our target consumer and an unwavering commitment to our brand purpose. Coach is truly unique. It's a brand that enables confidence, self-expression and authenticity with products crafted to last. Building on the strong foundation, we are confident in our ability to write the next great chapter of profitable growth for this iconic brand. Now moving to Kate Spade. We delivered second quarter revenue ahead of our expectations.These results were driven by outperformance during peak selling periods, including a record Thanksgiving week and CyberMonday event in North America. Importantly, we continue to invest in and advance the brand strategic priorities, becoming more emotional, more lifestyle and more global to drive lasting customer relationships and deliver balanced and sustainable growth. Touching on the details of the quarter. First, we created emotional connections with consumers through a focus on delivering an innovative and distinct offering. To this point, we reinforce the pillars of our handbag collection, highlighted by the Knott and Katy families, which continue to fuel our performance. And in December, we introduced the Gramercy, which has delivered strong performance and has over-indexed with new customers, underscoring the opportunity to expand the silhouette going forward.In addition, we launched new branding through a chenille monogramming platform on our Manhattan . Given the success of this style, we're expanding our logo offering with further iterations of the Spade flower across the assortment, which we believe represents an important platform for future growth and innovation. We also amplified our novelty offering, a differentiating element of our assortment and an important vehicle for brand storytelling. Our Zebra collection was particularly successful, while the candy-themed offering was a hit with consumers. At the same time, the slingback pump, which featured a champagne corkill was a top-performing style within footwear. Overall, our product initiatives, coupled with our use of data to deepen our understanding of consumer preferences, supported mid-single-digit handbag AUR growth at constant currency both globally and in North America despite more normalized promotional levels.This season, the North America consumer was more value-driven, over-indexing during holiday sale periods, which resulted in promotions that were above the prior year, though below 2 years ago. Importantly, we delivered overall gross margin improvement as we continue to manage the business for the long-term, balancing brand health and inventory management. Second, we remain focused on our strategy of becoming more lifestyle, delivering mid-teens revenue growth in the assortment. Importantly, we continue to see the customers who enter the brand through these categories are our highest value customers demonstrating the importance of lifestyle as a long-term driver of sustainable growth. In ready-to-wear, our collection of festive sweaters and skirts for the holiday season as well as trend-right outerwear pieces helped fuel mid-single-digit sales growth.Luxury, Fashion, WardrobePhoto by Laura Chouette on UnsplashAnd in footwear, our evergreen styles, notably boots and booties, led our performance, while jewelry delivered growth with strength across core and fashion pieces. Third, touching on marketing. We expressed the unique world of Kate Spade leaning into the power of brand storytelling and community. Our Have A Ball campaign reinforced Kate Spade's Joy Colors life purpose in a celebratory spirit, highlighting the brand as a gifting destination for the holiday. We synchronized activations to amplify our message across touch points, including global pop-up center around our candy collection, which were successful in attracting new customers. From a digital perspective, we continue to diversify across social platforms, notably TikTok and YouTube where we focused on engaging with a younger consumer.Taken together, our impactful marketing helped to fuel the recruitment of approximately 1 million new customers in North America with these customers continuing to enter the brand at a higher AUR than the balance. Additionally, we saw an overall increase in spend per customer. Importantly, we are engaging with consumers through our social impact effort, which connects our customers to our brand beyond product. Our purpose focuses on women's empowerment and mental health. As such, we have broadened our brand work to reach younger and more diverse audiences, notably through our social impact council. Finally, in keeping with our priority of becoming more global, we remain focused on meeting our target consumer where they shop around the world.To this end, we continue to roll out our new store concept, which began with our Marina Bay Sands Store in Singapore in October. Since then, we have expanded the concept further to Taipei and Chicago where we have seen strong initial reads. In closing, we continue to make important progress in advancing Kate Spade's strategic growth agenda. It is a global lifestyle brand synonymous with optimism and joy, a differentiated positioning with global relevance. As we enter the brand's 30th anniversary year, we have an appreciation for its past and confidence in the future. With an unwavering eye on our consumers and our unique DNA, we will continue to drive innovation while investing in capabilities to support sustainable, profitable growth. Turning to Stuart Weitzman.Revenue declined in the quarter, impacted by the brand's significant exposure to China as well as a decrease in wholesale, reflecting in part a reduction in off-price shipments as we remain focused on tight inventory management and brand elevation. Importantly, in our North America direct business, sales rose mid-single digits. Turning to the details. We made further progress on our strategy to win with heat and improve brand awareness. First, we curated an assortment of high motion product across occasion wear and casual styles. We continue to lead with our iconic styles as we build out the offering to engage with a wider set of consumers. Soho remained atop collection with notable success among younger customers given the family's on-trend lug sole.The Stuart, a new staple in our offering, resonated across age groups, while the iconic land styles acted as a strong recruitment tool. Additionally, we were pleased with the consumer response to our handbag launch. While a small assortment, the top handle style sold at an AUR of over $700 with engagement from both new and existing clients. Second, we focused on brand building in the wholesale channel, notably in international markets. We created high-impact activations across key accounts globally from London to Dubai. And after a successful pop-up at La Rinascente in Milan, we are now moving into a permanent space on the designer floor there in mid-February. Third, we fueled bread heat by delivering impactful marketing campaigns, amplifying our brand purpose to celebrate women who stand strong.The debut of Kim Kardashian as our global ambassador helped to drive an improvement in customer trends driving growth in new customers, including outsized gains with millennials. Looking to the balance of the year, we are innovating on our approach to connect with consumers and increase awareness. In February, we're set to launch our Kids Super collaboration, followed by a styling series utilizing influencer marketing to highlight our spring collection. Overall, we are progressing against our strategies to build brand awareness and offer products that spark desire. We are continuing to navigate the significant profit headwinds the brand is facing from pressures in the highly penetrated Greater China region, though remain focused on delivering a profitable fiscal year.In closing, our foundation is strong and our runway is significant. We are staying agile and disciplined in a volatile environment to successfully navigate current headwinds and at the same time, drive forward our long-term growth agenda. Importantly, we are well-positioned in attractive, durable categories, amplified by our digitally enabled direct-to-consumer platform, which powers our iconic brands to move at the speed of the consumer. We are confident that our competitive advantages and strategy will continue to drive sustainable growth and value for all our stakeholders. With that, I will turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '23 outlook. Scott?Scott Rowe: Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. As Joanne mentioned, we delivered solid results in the face of a volatile backdrop as we focused on the factors within our control. We achieved revenue of over $2 billion, while realizing the operating margin ahead of expectations and grew earnings per share 10% against last year, excluding $0.11 of currency pressure. At the same time, we returned $272 million to shareholders, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing long-term value. Turning to the details of the quarter, I'll start with revenue, which will be shared on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. Sales declined 2%, which included pressure in Greater China as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding Greater China, revenue increased 1%, led by outperformance in the balance of our international regions.In Japan, revenue increased 10%, while Other Asia grew 29%, driven by strength across Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and Korea. These trends were again led by traction with local customers. At the same time, sales to tourists improved versus the prior year that remained well below pre-pandemic levels, highlighting future opportunity. In Europe, sales were 20% above last year, fueled by higher international tourist traffic, notably from the Middle East and within Europe as well as continued growth with local customers. For Greater China, sales declined 20%, which was below our forecast due to incremental pressure associated with COVID impacting both stores and online. As Joanne mentioned, following the lifting of certain government restrictions in December, we've seen a meaningful improvement in traffic Q3 to date, notably during the Lunar New Year holiday.Therefore, as we approach guidance, we maintained the expectation for a strong sequential improvement in the second half of the year, albeit from a lower second quarter base. Overall, we still expect strong double-digit growth in the second half to fuel an increase for the fiscal year at constant currency. Turning to North America. Sales declined by 2% for both the total region and our direct business, in line with our guidance for a low single-digit decline. Importantly, we delivered North America operating income ahead of forecast and realized handbag AUR growth at both Coach and Kate Spade, underscoring our focus on brand health. By channel, our direct business declined 2%. That said, excluding Greater China, direct revenue grew low single digits, which included a mid-single-digit increase in stores fueled by continued traffic improvements and a low-single-digit decline in digital.And in wholesale revenue was 3% below the prior year. Moving down the P&amp;L, we delivered gross margin ahead of our projection and 50 basis points ahead of prior year. This year-over-year expansion included approximately 130 basis points of favorable freight offset by 100basis points of FX headwinds and the negative impact from lower penetration of high-margin China business. Therefore, excluding these impacts, gross margin was still ahead of prior year, driven by operational outperformance. SG&amp;A declined 1% and was slightly favorable to our prior outlook. In the quarter, we continued to prioritize high return initiatives, including platform investments and brand building activities underscored by mid-single-digit growth in our marketing spend.So taken together, operating margin and operating income were ahead of forecast. EPS grew 2% compared to the prior year or 10% on a currency-neutral basis and was favorable to forecast due to operational outperformance as well as a $0.03 tailwind from a more moderate year-over-year FX impact. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $846 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.67 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion revolver. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $552 million, including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $102 million. As anticipated, inventory at quarter end was 30% above prior year. We are pleased with our sequential progression in the quarter and the quantity and quality of our current inventory.We continue to expect to end fiscal year '23 with inventory up single digits compared to the prior year. Moving now to our capital allocation priorities. We continue to plan for approximately $1 billion in shareholder returns in fiscal 2023, which includes share repurchases of $700 million including $300 million bought back in the first half, including $200 million in the second quarter as planned and dividend payments totaling approximately $300 million. This is based on an annual dividend rate of $1.20 per share, which represents a 20% increase over the prior year. Our priorities remain unchanged. First, we are investing in the business to drive long-term profitable growth; and second, we are returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.In the future, we believe our platform is scalable and would evaluate M&amp;A that is accretive to our organic TSR plan. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. We've raised our earnings expectation, incorporating three key changes versus the prior outlook. First, our outlook now reflects the second quarter's operational outperformance of approximately $0.08. Second, we are including a more moderate headwind from currency, which provides a $0.10 benefit versus our previous guidance. And third, as previously noted, we've incorporated the expectation of more modest growth in Greater China for the fiscal year based on the incremental pressure we experienced in the second quarter. We've rebased our second half outlook given the lower Q2 results, which equates to roughly $0.10 of negative impact versus our prior guidance.Overall, our ability to increase our earnings outlook despite a volatile external environment, highlights the resilience and agility of Tapestry's operating model. So let's run through the details of our outlook, which replaces all previous guidance. For the fiscal year, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 2% to 3%. On a reported basis, we anticipate sales to be approximately $6.6 billion, which represents a slight decline compared to the prior year, including roughly 300 basis points of FX headwinds. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, our guidance continues to contemplate a low single-digit decline in the second half of the year, consistent with year-to-date trends. In Greater China, as previously mentioned, we expect a slight increase in the fiscal year.In Japan, we now expect mid-teens growth, while Other Asia is forecasted to grow approximately 35% reflecting strength in the second quarter and the continuation of these trends into the second half. In Europe, we continue to anticipate low double-digit gains. In addition, our outlook includes a year-over-year operating margin decline of over 70 basis points, which contemplates FX pressure of approximately 115 basis points. We expect the majority of this FX headwind to flow through the gross margin line. We anticipate gross margin slightly ahead of the prior year, largely reflecting favorable freight costs relative to prior expectations. Compared to fiscal '22, gross margin incorporates the benefit of moderating freight costs of 130 basis points as well as AUR growth, which is being partially offset by the previously anticipated rising input costs for materials as well as the negative impact of FX, as mentioned.On SG&amp;A, we continue to anticipate deleverage for the year, reflecting growth-driving initiatives, including increased marketing expenses to fuel long-term customer value, investments in digital and the planned 2023opening of our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas partially offset by proactive actions we've taken to reduce our expense base. Moving to below the line items, which are consistent with our prior guidance, net interest expense for the year is anticipated to be approximately $30 million to $35 million a significant decline versus fiscal '22, reflecting the benefit of our cross-currency swap agreements. Tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This represents an increase against last year, primarily due to the anticipated geographic mix of earnings.Weighted average diluted share count is expected to be in the area of 242 million shares. This reflects approximately $700 million in share repurchases expected in the fiscal year as noted. Taken together, we project EPS of $3.70 to $3.75 representing high single-digit growth compared to the prior year, which includes a year-over-year currency headwind of approximately $0.40. Finally, we now expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $300 million. This decrease from the prior outlook is due to the timing of store openings and renovations in Asia, mainly in China, some of which have been deferred to fiscal year '24. Given the shift, we now expect approximately one-third of this spend to be related to openings and renovations with the balance dedicated to our ongoing digital and IT initiatives, including investment related to our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas.As previously outlined, given the volatile environment and last year's atypical comparisons, we continue to expect significant variability by quarter. Specifically, we project revenue and earnings growth to be back half weighted, helped by the planned return to growth in Greater China and lower freight costs on a year-over-year basis, providing a tailwind to margin. Drilling down in the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 5% in constant currency, which includes gains in Greater China. On a reported basis, we anticipate sales to be up slightly, including a negative impact of approximately 350 basis points from FX. We expect EPS to approach $0.60, representing a strong year-over-year increase despite a currency headwind of approximately $0.10 versus the prior year.So in closing, we delivered record second quarter earnings, outperforming expectations and are raising our earnings outlook for the year despite a volatile backdrop. In addition, we remain on track to return $1 billion to shareholders in fiscal '23, underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and significant cash flow generation. Importantly, our performance reinforces our competitive advantages and validates our strategy. As we look forward, we remain focused on delivering against our long-term priorities to drive sustainable growth and shareholder returns.

Ralph Lauren also beat sales expectations, noting a solid performance across multiple regions, including China. On the other hand, Capri Holdings, which owns Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo and Versace, missed forecasts for the third quarter and trimmed its guidance.More from Footwear NewsMichael B. Jordan Gets Sharply Suited in Tweed Blazer &amp; Christian Louboutin Boots at 'Creed 3' Mexico City PremiereYounger Consumers Help Tapestry Beat Q2 Expectations, But Stuart Weitzman Takes Hit From China Shutdowns &amp; WholesaleShoe Retailers Have Too Much Stuff -- That's Bad News for These Brands Who Need to Sell to ThemOverall, retail executives and analysts have adopted an optimistic view for luxury going into 2023, thanks to the sector’s base of high-income consumers who are more resilient to higher prices and recession fears. And while Tapestry, Capri Holdings and Ralph Lauren all play in a similar luxury lane, each company has a different breakdown when it comes to channel penetration and international distribution. This has led to disparate results during a volatile environment.Ralph Lauren, in particular, was a standout this quarter, in part due to the success of a recent turnaround plan focused on streamlining its retail strategy and doubling down on its direct channels. The retailer said it plans to open more than 250 stores over the next three years, focusing on 30 top cities around the globe as president and CEO Patrice Louvet aims to reestablish its standing as a strong luxury fashion player.“Part of the reason for Ralph Lauren’s relative outperformance is that it is at an earlier stage of reinvention compared to brands like Coach or Michael Kors,” explained GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders in a statement. “As such, it still reaping the rewards of many of the corrective actions it is taking to elevate its offer and reduce its reliance on third parties to sell its product.”Story continuesThe problem with wholesaleRelying on wholesale partners turned out to be a challenge for various luxury players this quarter, as department stores and other wholesale retailers pulled back on orders to deal with inventory excesses and waning consumer demand. This weakness in wholesale took a hit on companies that rely on that channel, such as Steve Madden and Capri.“Capri’s weak report was due to challenges in its wholesale channel,” said UBS analyst Jay Sole in a Thursday note. “Since Tapestry has a very small wholesale business, it was less affected by this trend.”Capri’s wholesale revenues dropped 20% drop in Q3, with major challenges in North America largely due to price increases. Capri chairman and CEO John Idol told analysts that the company is planning for the wholesale business to be down “quite significantly” in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year.Like Tapestry, Ralph Lauren also noted a tough wholesale environment but was overall less impacted by the slowdown there.Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen said the company has experienced “minimal cancellations” for spring 2023 and still expects wholesale revenues to be up in Q4, despite caution in the marketplace.China impactChina has also been a challenging area for luxury brands this quarter. After months of closures and shutdowns, new waves of Covid-19 have gripped the country as it reopens to travelers and discards its zero-COVID policy. Global footwear companies have been cautiously optimistic about how the reopening will improve business — and progress has varied.Tapestry’s sales in China dropped 20% in the quarter due to Covid-19 related issues, which especially impacted the Stuart Weitzman brand. However, the company said it saw a lift during the Lunar New Year after the country lifted its containment restrictions.Capri said revenue in Mainland China “declined significantly” in the quarter due to Covid-19 cases surging as the country reopened.Ralph Lauren, on the other hand, reporting that sales in Mainland China were up in the high single digits, despite Covid-19 disruptions and the previous closure of more than 90% of the company’s stores there. The company expects further recovery in the region as the brand strengthens local ties with Chinese consumers.“We’ve been very encouraged by the reopening. We are now up and running everywhere, and we’re seeing consumers reengage strongly,” said Louvet in a call with analysts. “The work that the teams are doing on brand desirability in China is really resonating with the consumer, and they’re weaving the brand into the local fabric of the Chinese culture in a way that really sets us apart.”Goldman Sachs analysts noted this edge in a Thursday note, describing Ralph Lauren’s momentum in China as “outperforming peers.”“We believe that the company’s key city investments and brand elevation strategies are helping to support sequential strength, particularly in China,” the analysts wrote.]"

The Nasdaq was down 0.6%, and the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2%.Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended the day flat, but its days of selling - in the wake of its AI chatbot Bard's mishap - wounded sentiment on tech. A fall in semiconductors also weighed on tech following a slide in Nvidia.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell more than 4% as some question how much upside lies ahead for the stock, which is up about 44% year to date on bets that the surge in interest in AI applications – following strong demand for OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool – will boost chip demand.“Nvidia is trading rich from a valuation perspective,” said Greg Bassuk, chief executive officer at AXS Investments in New York, pointing to the risk of “multiple compression” ahead.Sentiment on growth sectors like tech were also hurt by renewed concerns of Fed hikes, with many now expecting the Fed to follow up its March hike, with another hike in May.Treasury yields jumped, with the 2-year Treasury yield closing above 4.5% for the first time since November.The earnings front, meanwhile, served up mostly weaker than expected results.LYFT Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) tumbled more than 36%, its biggest single-day decline, after the ride-sharing company reported revenue guidance that fell short of estimates and a surprise quarterly loss as lower prices and rising costs hurt margins.“A different mix of rides, improving driver supply will cause less primetime pricing, and reduced base pricing due to heightened competition are all negatively impacting FY23 outlook,” Wedbush said as it downgraded the stock to Neutral from Outperform.Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), meanwhile, reported quarterly results that missed on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 8% lower. But some analysts attributed the weakness to weather-related cancellations of bookings that weighed on quarterly results.Story continues“[W]e are inclined to look through reported 4Q numbers, as Hurricane Ian in October and a rash of weather-related cancellations late in December served as the primary factors behind the miss,” Deustche Bank said in a note.Energy stocks kept losses in the broader market in check, supported by rising oil prices after Russia said it would cut production by 500,000 barrels per day next month, at a time when many are expecting energy demand to be bolstered by the China reopening.“The 1.1 mb/d rise in China demand this year (Q4/Q4) should push oil markets back into deficit in June, expose structural underinvestment, boost prices, and lead OPEC to reverse its November 2022 production cut in 2023H2 (the second half of 2023),” Goldman Sachs said in a note after cutting its 2023 price target on Brent crude by $5 to $75 per barrel.In other news, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 5% after its investor Ross Gerber said he will pursue a seat on the electric carmaker's board amid frustrations about the electric carmaker's lack of marketing, and public relations efforts.""Tesla has let Elon be the voice of Tesla forever.

It is certainly time for long-term investors to reevaluate their portfolios and possibly get back in on the growth names that fell out of favor in 2022.Instead of focusing on Tesla and other beaten-down growth names, especially after the insane YTD climb, a more prudent approach might be to buy stocks poised to thrive even if the U.S. economy doesn’t reach that goldilocks zone everyone is hoping for.Today we dig into three highly-ranked stocks that outperformed the market in 2022 amid the turmoil and are primed to keep running higher in 2023 even if Wall Street is forced to take its foot off the growth pedal.McKesson Corporation (MCK)McKesson is a healthcare products distributor that benefitted both from the covid pandemic and a return to normalcy as more people start receiving regularly scheduled medical care, screenings, and more. McKesson partners with hospitals, doctors’ offices, pharmacies, manufacturers, and beyond to help deliver medicines, medical products, and healthcare services.McKesson grows alongside the overall expansion of healthcare, pharmaceuticals, biotech, and medical products without having to undertake the massive amounts of research and development that many of the innovators in the space do.

Halliburton’s products and offerings help oil and gas companies with everything from exploration and well construction all the way to abandonment activities. The entire oil and energy sector benefited from soaring prices last year, and oil prices are holding up better than some expected even though they are well off their records.The ongoing Russian invasion has greatly disrupted global oil and gas supplies. More importantly, fighting and the sanctions have forced a reevaluation of the status quo. Oil exploration and drilling are gradually expanding after years of slowing output as more countries race toward greater energy independence, all of which is music to Halliburton’s ears.Perhaps most importantly for near-term and long-term investors, oil is without a doubt going to play a vital role in the U.S. and around the world for years to come even as alternative and renewable energy booms. Haliburton topped our EPS estimate once again on January 24 and raised its outlook, with HAL executives calling for its “earnings power to strengthen in 2023 and beyond.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks estimates call for Haliburton’s FY23 sales to climb 16% and another 11% in FY24 to $26.14 billion. Plus, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 43% this year and 22% in FY24. This outlook showcases its growth runway, stability, and niche within the oil sector as many face a pending downturn after a blowout year. And Haliburton posted 33% revenue growth in 2022 and 99% adjusted earnings expansion.Halliburton’s upward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.

DexCom’s prospects in alternative markets such as non-intensive diabetes management, hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide it with a competitive edge in the MedTech space.Apart from making continued advancements with respect to its key strategic objectives, DexCom also ended the quarter with new patient additions. It launched an updated sensor algorithm in multiple countries in the second half of 2022, making the latest G7 sensor technology available to international markets. The company received FDA clearance for G7 sensor technology in December 2022. These developments are likely to support the company’s future growth.Nevertheless, the contraction in gross margin is a woe, reflecting the rising cost of sales.

For more top stocks, head on over to Bank of America's 5 Stock Picks for 2023. 2023 is turning out to be an interesting year for the stock market. After major technology and growth firms suffered massive losses on the market last year, within a month they have registered surprising gains that have questioned the pessimistic sentiment emanating from several quarters. For instance, while Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares were among the worst performers of 2022, year to date, the stock has appreciated by a massive 86%. Yet, Tesla isn't the only company making waves on the market. Two others, namely Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) lost more than half of their market capitalization last year. But lo and behold, as we settle into 2023, the duo's shares are up by 47% and 51%, respectively. Quite a turnaround if you ask us, but still a long way to go to retake previous heights.For the market as a whole, there are two key questions - both tightly related - that are on everyone's minds. 2022 was marked by the Federal Reserve's all out approach to battle inflation. This fight, fueled by rising interest rates, generates worries that the economy might head into a recession. So a debate on recession and interest rates continues to rage, and even investment banks have picked their sides. For instance, while The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that a recession can be avoided, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is of the opinion that it is possible one will strike the economy later this year. Another optimist among us is President Joe Biden, who in a fresh interview given to PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff, shared that not only does he not see a recession this year, but next year as well. President Biden simply responded to a question asking his thoughts on a recession this year by stating:No. Or next year. From the moment I got elected, how many of the experts are saying within the next six months is going to be recession?Story continuesHowever, analysts at the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) would like to disagree with the President. Not only do they believe that a recession is highly likely this year, but their strategy to deal with the uncertain economic outlook entails investing in bonds for the first half of this year and then switching to equities later on. The financial firm's sentiment on recession is as follows:A recession is all but inevitable in the U.S., Euro Area and UK: Expect a mild U.S. recession in the first half of 2023 with a risk that it starts later. Europe likely sees recession this winter [2022] with a shallow recovery thereafter as real incomes and likely overtightening pressure demand.Yet, since it's a sell side firm, Bank of America still has its favorite pick of stocks, and out of these, some of the best performing ones in 2023 so far are Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC).Bank of America's 15 Stock Picks for 2023Copyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We scoured the Internet to find out which stocks are Bank Of America's favorite picks for 2023.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Minnesota Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Minnesota would be the 53rd biggest economy in the world with a GDP of $412 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This means that the state's GDP is bigger than Egypt, Denmark and Singapore. 27 companies headquartered in Minnesota are in the Fortune 500. Currently, Minnesota is a major contributor to agriculture in the U.S. and is the country's biggest producer of green peas, sweet corn and sugar beets and is home to major food processing companies which then turn crops into the finished product.While Minnesota's economy has evolved, some industries which have dominated the last couple of centuries are still important contributors to the economy of the the state such as forestry. Further, even though iron ores are mostly depleted in a state which produced a large portion of total iron production in the world, taconite mining is still an important contributor to Minnesota's economy. Retail is another industry which has maintained a strong presence and some of the most popular retail chains in addition to being among the biggest retailers in the country, with thousands of locations maintained across the country.25 biggest Minnesota companies and stocksPixabay/Public DomainIn June 2022, Minnesota's unemployment rate was just 1.8%, among the best in the country but it has declined in the last six months and in November 2022, unemployment in the state increased to 2.3%, though it is still the second lowest unemployment rate in the country right now, with only Utah outperforming Minnesota in this measure. Despite the slight increase in the past 6 months, there shouldn't really be a major cause for concern since the unemployment rate has been historically low and is still well below the average. Whether this continues in 2023 amid a recession still remains to be seen. According to DEED commissioner Steve Grove stated that Minnesota's economy has grown much faster than most other states in 2022 and has seen fourteen straight months of jobs growth while its labor participation rate being 67.9% in November.Story continuesTo attract businesses to the state, Minnesota provides various incentives, grants and tax credits which could change the composition of the biggest Minnesota companies and stocks in the future. The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development provides various such incentives including angel tax credit schemes, Urban Initiative Loan Program, Minnesota Job Creation Funding, Small Business Administration Financing Programs, Indian Business Loan Program and State Small Business Credit Initiative.

Credit and debit card spending was up in January, a growth of about 5% from the numbers that we saw a year ago.So for more on that, we want to bring in Ann Berry founder of Threadneedle Ventures. And Ann, I think a lot of people, when they're trying to figure out whether or not the rally that we've seen since the start of the year, if that's going to continue, hinges on the consumer, the strength of the consumer at this point. What do you think?ANN BERRY: If it does, I'm really nervous because I think there's consumer buoyancy. The way in which the data is being read is really positive. It's the positive spin. Credit card spending's up. You know what it also means? The consumer's taking out more debt. And what I worry about as savings draw down for the rest of this year and that debt load is going up, I don't think it ends very well for the consumer towards the end of this 2023.DAVE BRIGGS: Is there data showing that concern in terms of debt because I mean, yes, to your point, the credit-debit spend is how they're lopping it together, 5.1% increase versus 2.2% the prior month? Aren't the-- isn't the consumer just in better shape than we thought?ANN BERRY: Well, first of all, that number excludes BNPL, right, which is a whole category that no one talks about, which is another form of consumer debt. Small relative to credit card debt--DAVE BRIGGS: Very small and shrinking.ANN BERRY: But it popped over the holiday season. When you looked at holiday spending, it became a little bit more significant. Other kinds of data, record numbers of consumers are tapping their 401(k) right now to pay for medical emergencies and to pay for mortgages. So not every consumer is the same. And I think the hardest-hit, as always, are the ones with very limited savings.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: What about earnings season so far, just given the state of the consumer? I mean, look at consumer staples. We're hearing a bit of a mixed picture just in terms of sometimes consumers are willing to pay those higher prices that companies have raised over the last couple of quarters versus other names, some in the luxury space, that are starting to see a bit of a backlash. People simply aren't spending. What's been your takeaway from earnings season so far?ANN BERRY: Well, it's-- on the consumer side, it's interesting. Luxury really held up as you looked at it over the last couple of years. Two areas tend to do well when the consumer's under pressure, luxury, because the very wealthy tend to be insulated from some of these macro forces, and then value, the Walmarts, the Costcos tend to do very well as-- to do well in these periods.I think we've seen that. I think luxury paring back makes sense. But I think we're going to see value continue to do quite well.DAVE BRIGGS: When you look at a company like Pepsi, we've seen them increase prices beyond the rate of inflation.ANN BERRY: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: And what they're seeing is demand has dropped a little bit. And volume has dropped a little bit. But those price hikes have more than made up for it. So they have no reason to lower prices. What does that mean for the Fed?ANN BERRY: Yeah, I don't think prices are going backwards, by the way. And Chipotle-- it's Chipotle who came out and said, we hiked up prices. They're not going to go up anymore, but they're not coming down either.DAVE BRIGGS: Right.ANN BERRY: And that's important. Inflation is the rate of increase. So I think, as long as we see the increases stop, things can start to stay still. That makes the Fed's life easier. But I don't think we've stopped seeing companies put up their prices yet behind the excuse of ongoing inflation. That cycle's got to break. It's not broken yet.SEANA SMITH: So what does that mean then for equities? Because if you at least look since the start of the year, we've-- we're off to a strong start with the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ. Can we continue that momentum if we don't see substantial improvement in inflation?ANN BERRY: I don't think so because we know-- look, the Fed's been super clear. And I'm actually a little bit confused by what's happened in the market. Jay Powell was super-clear.Rates are going to continue to go up because inflation has not yet come to the point where it needs to come. I just think the sentiment is baked in right now. I think investors are excited to finally see companies come up with plans. Dan Ives just said, here's what was disappointing about Lyft, crickets, there's no strategy. We don't know what execution's going to be.This earnings season, we have seen companies come out with real plans, with concrete paths towards profitability. I think that's why we see a relatively strong market. But I don't understand it in a macro sense.DAVE BRIGGS: In some cases, those plans are being forced by activist investors.ANN BERRY: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: There's been a real increased trend. So we started with Blackwells Capital on Peloton. We had Nelson Peltz who says that is over in regard to Disney. Elliott Management and ThirdPoint with Salesforce, Ryan Cohen with Nordstrom, this is just to mention a few. Is there a common thread here amongst all these activist investor moves we're seeing?ANN BERRY: Well, you've mentioned the ones that have actually affected change. Some of the activists come in. They have change. They don't have change.What's so interesting to me about Disney and now Salesforce, these are businesses with huge amounts of stickiness, with really strong brands, which have historically had pretty good response to their management teams. And yet these activists are coming in and saying, no, we're finding things for you to do.And so what I find interesting about this is they're succeeding in getting change. And it's also raising a broader question of why aren't these teams figuring this out themselves before the activists come in.DAVE BRIGGS: You see the skepticism on my face. And that's because Nelson Peltz.ANN BERRY: Tell me about-- why are you skeptical about Nelson Peltz?DAVE BRIGGS: What did he do there? He didn't affect any change? Bob Iger was going to do this with or without Nelson Peltz.ANN BERRY: How do we know that?DAVE BRIGGS: He took a victory that he had nothing to do with.ANN BERRY: I don't remember--DAVE BRIGGS: He wanted a board seat, and they ignored him. They said, sit over there in the corner.ANN BERRY: I feel the heat. This is great.[LAUGHTER]But when did Bob-- when did Bob Iger specifically come out and say--DAVE BRIGGS: He's been on the job two months.ANN BERRY: But he didn't come out and say, I'm going to take $3 billion of cost out until Nelson Peltz came out and said, here's a specific-- here's what the activists do. And this is what happened with Peloton. Here is a really specific plan with specific actions I want this management team to come up with.Bob Iger came back. I rang the victory lap. I'm a retail-- full disclosure-- shareholder in Disney. When he came back, I was thrilled, right? But he didn't have a plan. He didn't have anything specific until he was, to your point, a little bit of time in the seat.DAVE BRIGGS: You don't think those things were already in motion? You don't think that was Bob Iger's plan? And by the way, the dividend, we don't know how much it is. It was a modest dividend at a later date.ANN BERRY: If what Nelson Peltz did was force communication with the market, so we went from perhaps something is on the come to here's now something specific that we can hang our hat on when it comes to actual earnings forecasts and the outlook, from a shareholder perspective, I like that.DAVE BRIGGS: Sorry to hijack the conversation.SEANA SMITH: I was going to say, how do you look at it, though, from an investor's perspective, right? If there is activist investor involvement, is that an opportunity then, do you think, to get in and buy some of these stocks?ANN BERRY: So it really depends. And to go back to the Disney example because it's so much fun that we get so riled up about it--[LAUGHTER]Here's why I like that situation. Again, it was about specifics. This was the same with Peloton. Here's a very specific plan. It was very analytical. It was very rigorous. And it was very operationally-focused. That I like because then you've got a CEO who's able to respond to something specific.What I don't like as a shareholder is if an activist turns up, makes a bunch of noise, doesn't have something specific to respond to, then that's a distraction for the management team. And that is actually not good for the shareholder. So there are different kinds of approaches.DAVE BRIGGS: So like Ryan Cohen and Alibaba, that one doesn't make any sense to me. You're dealing with the Chinese government. How are you going to enact change?ANN BERRY: Well, in that case-- and I'm not in Alibaba-- that's where I would say that falls in the bucket of saber-rattling. And then it's just going to be one more thing for a CEO to deal with other than creating value.DAVE BRIGGS: I guess I'm just saying, I think Barry McCarthy deserves more credit too in the case of Peloton. He came in. He's been trying everything since starting there, only been on the job about a year.ANN BERRY: Yep.DAVE BRIGGS: I'll stop my rant. But it was a good discussion, a good back-and-forthSEANA SMITH: It was a great discussion.ANN BERRY: But it's a great-- he's a CFO. He's a capital allocator. That's his-- that was his superpower.SEANA SMITH: Well, they certainly are. We're seeing a change at a number of these companies. Ann Berry, always great to have you. Thanks so much for coming in the studio for us.ANN BERRY: Thanks so much for having me on.DAVE BRIGGS: Good to see you.]"

(OKE) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Oneok basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Oneok, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for OneokThis natural gas company is expected to earn $3.77 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2022, which represents a year-over-year change of 12.5%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Oneok. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Oneok to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Oneok Inc.

It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently -$0.20 a share, and CWEN is 13 days out from its next earnings report.Clearway Energy's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 77.19% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.88.Story continuesOKE and CWEN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

AKAM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 14, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 2.4%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.1%, on average.The Cambridge, MA-based company is expected to have recorded flat revenues year over year, despite growth in its security business. Growing demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, mobile products and online video amid high data traffic is favoring its prospects but is likely to have been offset by a challenging macroeconomic environment.Factors at PlayDuring the fourth quarter, Akamai collaborated with NESN to offer its media delivery solutions to help live stream all 2022-23 Bruins home games and future Red Sox home games in 4K/HDR through the NESN 360 app. NESN is the first regional sports network in the United States to live stream Major League Baseball and National Hockey League games in 4K/HDR natively via a streaming app. This is likely to be reflected in the upcoming results.Akamai continued to unveil cybersecurity tools to mitigate cyber risks and block malicious files uploaded to web apps and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which are a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. During the to-be-reported quarter, it enhanced its DDoS protection platform (Prolexic) with a global rollout of new, fully software-defined scrubbing centers, which will extend its dedicated defense capacity to 20 Tbps and accelerate future product innovations. The move enables Akamai Prolexic to defend customers from the largest multi-terabit attacks and provide better performance and reliability. Such state-of-the-art products are likely to have aided its performance in the quarter.However, challenging market conditions and business uncertainty are likely to have a detrimental effect on its revenues as customers tend to be more cautious in their investments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $903 million, flat with the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $905 million. For the fourth quarter of 2022, Akamai expects revenues between $890 million and $915 million. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at $1.27, suggesting a decrease from $1.49 reported a year ago.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Akamai in the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +4.35%, with the former pegged at $1.32 and the latter at $1.27.

The initiative aims to help close the digital skill divide that is currently limiting educational and employment opportunities for nearly 50 million Americans.NSC received a $200,000 grant from Comcast to help state leaders bridge existing workforce development programs with federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) and Digital Equity Act (DEA) funding. Digital skills are now required across virtually every industry and occupation, yet nearly one in three U.S. workers lack the foundational digital skills necessary to enter and thrive in today's workforce, with workers of color and those earning lower wages disproportionately affected. These programs represent a once-in-a-generation investment in closing the digital skills gap equitably.""If local, state, and federal decisionmakers fully understand its potential - and if workforce and broadband offices work together on its implementation - this federal investment in digital equity could have a profound impact on closing the digital skill divide for tens of millions of America's workers,"" said Andy Van Kleunen, NSC CEO. ""We're grateful to Comcast for their partnership in making that happen.""When digital skills grow, our economy grows.DALILA WILSON-SCOTTEVP and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast Corporation and President of the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation""The demand for digital skills exists across every industry and throughout the workforce. That's why we're proud to partner with the National Skills Coalition to help ensure more local and national leaders are aware of and take advantage of public sector digital equity funds to invest in the skill development programs that are critical to closing our country's digital divide,"" said Dalila Wilson-Scott, EVP and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast Corporation and President of the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation.Story continuesAs part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by Congress in 2021, states have recently begun to receive historic federal investments in digital equity through the $42 billion BEAD program and the $2.75 billion DEA.BEAD funding will help states expand access to broadband, digital devices, and digital skills in unserved or under-served communities. BEAD also invests in training local workers to install and maintain new broadband infrastructure in their communities. Complementary, DEA will provide grants to states to support a range of digital inclusion activities, including digital skill building and efforts to advance awareness of adoption programs such as the Affordable Connectivity Program.In addition to the grant, NSC and Comcast will partner on research, communications, and trainings that highlight best practices for implementing federal digital inclusion funding. The work will engage federal, state and local officials; state workforce and digital inclusion advocates; and national equity organizations.Comcast's partnership with the National Skills Coalition is part of Project UP, the company's comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity and help build a future of unlimited possibilities.Comcast Corporation, Friday, February 10, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/738945/Comcast-Partners-With-National-Skills-Coalition-To-Close-the-Digital-Skill-Divide]"

Its strong positioning promises to benefit both businesses and the wider economy.This optimism has been mirrored in a survey conducted by Deloitte, with an incredibly promising 93% of oil and gas executives expressing positive sentiment towards the industry in the future. Therefore,InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe energy industry is always evolving, and the shift to renewable energy sources in the long term is no exception. Despite this, the top oil and gas stocks remain strong investments that could provide a source of steady growth for years. Having said that, let’s look at three of the best oil and gas stocks to buy now.DVNDevon Energy$61.02XOMExxonMobil$113.94CVXChevron$172.00Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is a compelling stock for investors looking for a balanced return combining dividend yield and capital appreciation. With an impressive 8.5% dividend yield, DVN rewards shareholders with a reliable income stream and healthy capital appreciation.Indeed, DVN’s share price has surged over 20% over the past year, offering bargain hunters the chance to capitalize on an attractive entry point.Devon Energy’s success in 2022 was heralded by a boom in the price of crude, allowing it to achieve a record-breaking $2.1 billion of free cash flow for the year.This allowed the company to make sizable investments, including reducing its outstanding shares by 4% through stock buybacks. Moreover, Devon has given no indications that its reliable dividend is in danger. In fact, the firm has enough resources to effectively shield it against potential storms ahead for its growing business.ExxonMobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comStory continuesWith production increasing more than 30% in Guyana and the Permian Basin throughout 2022, it’s no surprise that ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) achieved strong bottom-line growth.As a result, its adjusted earnings for the full year jumped an impressive 161.3%, hitting $14.06 per share and exceeding analysts’ expectations of $13.94 per share. The company also enjoyed robust 44.8% growth in full-year revenues, coming in at $413.7 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $427.9 billion.Exxon Mobil stock could benefit from multiple sources this year. Economic forecasts suggest that a tight supply of crude oil could help counteract decreased demand, which may stop the price of oil from dropping and ultimately provide a stable platform for the company’s earnings.Additionally, the company is taking innovative steps to reduce costs and move into renewable energy, giving it an added lift. This is in addition to beneficial return-of-capital initiatives such as regular share buybacks and its generous 3.25% dividend yield, with 20 years of payout expansion.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has certainly seen its fair share of success in the past year, largely due to the increase in global crude oil prices.The energy giant’s market capitalization has grown substantially to over $350 billion while posting record profits virtually every quarter last year.It recently released its full-year operating results, where its adjusted earnings came in at $18.8 per share, more than double the $8.13 it generated last year. Additionally, full-year sales came in at an impressive $246.3 billion, up substantially from its sales of $162.5 million a year ago.With record cash flows and earnings, it increased its investments by more than 75% compared to 2021. Also, its one-year dividend growth rate is at a stellar 7%, roughly 38% higher than its 5-year average. XOM remains in a spectacular position to continue growing its top and bottom lines while rewarding its shareholders.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2022.Alluvial Capital Management highlighted stocks like P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) in the fourth quarter investor letter. Headquartered in  Dallas, Texas, P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) provides multi-asset class private market solutions. On February 9, 2023, P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) stock closed at $11.26 per share. One-month return of P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX)  was -3.26% and its shares lost 10.14% of their value over the last 52 weeks. P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX)  has a market capitalization of $1.318 billion.Alluvial Capital Management made the following comment about P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“It has been a quiet stretch for P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX), our second-largest holding as of the date of this letter. Third quarter earnings were healthy. The fundraising environment for alternative investments is tougher now than it was a year ago, but P10 continues to add assets under management and has maintained its 2023 targets. Fortunately for P10, it does not have significant exposure to the most challenged of asset classes, real estate. On the third quarter earnings conference call, CoCEO Clark Webb remarked “….I will tell you, it’s much harder today to allocate capital externally when our stock trades where it does. So you can see that we have instituted a buyback and have begun buying back shares. But we are certainly hard-pressed to find businesses like ours trading at valuations like us. And so we do have a new competitor in the room, if you will, which is our own stock.” No argument from me! At higher valuations, I would rather see P10 use its resources to acquire new alternative assets managers than repurchase shares. But at these prices, the case for repurchasing shares is compelling. The company took advantage of the dip below $10 to repurchase quite a few shares and announced a $20 million increase to the buyback authorization at year-end. Shares have rebounded from the lows but remain extremely cheap.”Story continuesSource: PEXELSP10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in United Rentals (URI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to URI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?United Rentals' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at United Rentals' main business drivers.Headquartered in Stamford, CT, United Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of 1,521 rental locations in United States, Canada and Europe. Moreover, it operates in 49 states and every Canadian province. The company offers 4,600 classes of equipment for rent at a total original equipment cost (“OEC”) of $19.6 billion (as of December 2022).The company’s customer base includes construction and industrial companies, utilities, municipalities, government agencies, independent contractors and homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations. The company’s principal products and services are equipment rental, sale of rental equipment, new equipment, contractor supplies, services and other.United Rentals serves customers as a single-source solution, provided through two business segments: General Rentals and Specialty or Trench, Power and Fluid Solutions.General Rentals (accounted for 73.7% of total revenues in 2022) includes the rental of construction, aerial and industrial equipment, general tools and light equipment, along with related services and activities. The segment includes the rental of the following: i) general construction and industrial equipment ii) aerial work platforms and iii) general tools and light equipment. The general rentals segment is comprised of four geographic divisions - Central, Northeast, Southeast and West - and operates throughout the United States and Canada.Story continuesSpecialty (26.3%) includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services like trench safety equipment, power and HVAC equipment, and fluid solutions equipment.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For United Rentals, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in February 2013 would be worth $8,476.55, or a 747.65% gain, as of February 10, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 168.89% and the price of gold went up 7.09% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for URI too.United Rentals’ fourth-quarter 2022 earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but grew year over year given sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business. Earnings and revenues grew 31.8% and 18.7%, respectively, driven by higher rental revenues (up 18.8%), fleet productivity (up 5.9%) and absorptions, owing to the broad-based recovery of activity across end markets served by URI. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 280 basis points (bps), owing to higher margins from rental revenues.

271,ab4c37cb-9fa4-3c58-9927-ba7f7747afcb,URI,2023-02-11,5 Must-Buy Stocks Flying High Year to Date With More Upside,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-must-buy-stocks-flying-130501185.html,1676034301,STORY,"['COMP', '^GSPC', 'URI', 'MCHP', 'CHWY']","[U.S. stock markets are rallying this year despite occasional fluctuations. Although it is too early to take a decision, market participants have regained confidence on risky assets like equities to some extent after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have rallied 1.7%, 6.3% and 12.6%, respectively.This trend is expected to continue as the rate of inflation and consequently the magnitude of the Fed’s interest rate hike has declined. Buoyed by the early 2023 rally, several stocks have popped. We have selected five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong upside left.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.Story continuesU.S. Economy is CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter’s growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy to expand by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities are the primary reasons the recent for job cuts. Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, the U.S. labor market remains resilient. Nonfarm payrolls in January came in at 517,000 well above the consensus estimate of 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, below the consensus mark of 3.6%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks that have rallied more than 20% year to date.

The spin-off will take many months to be completed, and FIS will also entertain any acquisition offers for the unit during this period, the sources added.Much of FIS's merchant business consists of Worldpay, which it bought for $43 billion in 2019. Since then, FIS shares have lost more than half their value, leaving it with a market capitalization of $45 billion, as the company fights to stay competitive with old and new financial technology players promising better and cheaper services.The Jacksonville, Florida-based company could announce the spinoff as early as next week, unveiling the results of a strategic review it embarked upon in December following pressure from hedge funds D.E. Shaw and JANA Partners, according to the sources.The sources cautioned that no transaction is certain and asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations.FIS declined to comment. The company is due to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 15.Several conglomerates, including General Electric Co, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kellogg Co and Toshiba Corp, have broken up their sprawling businesses over the past few years amid pressure from investors to become leaner and focus on enhanced profitability in some of the core businesses.FIS's break-up would leave it with a core processing systems business, enabling transactions among banks and other financial institutions, as well as its capital markets division serving investment firms.Merchant solutions makes up about 30% of the company's revenue, while its banking solutions arm constitutes about 46%, and capital market solutions the remainder.(Reporting by David French, Anirban Sen and Milana Vinn in New York; Additional Reporting by Amy-Jo Crowley in London; editing by Diane Craft)]"

FIS is set to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 15, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the financial solutions provider’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.74, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny due to weaker-than-expected performance in its three major segments. Inflated costs affected its Banking Solutions and Merchant Solutions’ profits. The negatives were partially offset by higher volumes and lower expenses.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.70 has witnessed no movement in the past week. The estimate indicates an 11.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $1.92 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.7 billion, suggesting a rise of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Fidelity National’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 0.9%. This is depicted in the graph below.Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseFidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseFidelity National Information Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteFidelity National is likely to have continued benefiting from the digital transformation of the global economy in the fourth quarter. Rising investments in mobile banking and product expansion are also expected to have played a major role in boosting the company’s performance. FIS’s investments in technology and innovation across high-growth markets are anticipated to have helped expand its total addressable market in the quarter. However, expenses are likely to have risen due to the investments.Fidelity National’s acquisition of Payrix is likely to have supported its Banking Solutions unit’s sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues indicates 2.6% growth from the year-ago period.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Capital Market Solutions segment predicts 1.7% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for the unit’s adjusted EBITDA signals a 2.9% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.In the fourth quarter, cross-border travel is likely to have witnessed a continued increase. This is expected to have boosted the demand for the FIS e-commerce payment gateway and the new payment platform. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Merchant Solutions revenues from the segment predicts a 1.1% year-over-year increase.However, a rising expense base, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits, as well as some inflationary pressures, is likely to have affected the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the upgrades of platforms and applications are expected to have increased the company’s costs in the December-end quarter, reducing the profit levels.The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA from the Banking Solutions unit suggests a 5.6% decrease from the prior quarter’s reported figure. Also, the consensus mark for adjusted EBITDA in Merchant Solutions indicates a 6.6% year-over-year decline, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Fidelity National this time around.

Brands' (NYSE:YUM) Upcoming Dividend Will Be Larger Than Last Year's,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-nyse-yum-upcoming-121012119.html,1676117412,STORY,['YUM'],"[Yum! Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE:YUM) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.605 on 10th of March. This takes the annual payment to 1.8% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands Yum! Brands' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Yum! Brands' earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 39.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 37% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.14 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.42. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.8% a year over that time. We have seen cuts in the past, so while the growth looks promising we would be a little bit cautious about its track record.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 4.0% per year. The company has been growing at a pretty soft 4.0% per annum, and is paying out quite a lot of its earnings to shareholders. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it definitely signals that dividend growth could be constrained in the future unless earnings start to pick up again.In SummaryOverall, it's great to see the dividend being raised and that it is still in a sustainable range. While the payout ratios are a good sign, we are less enthusiastic about the company's dividend record. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 3 warning signs for Yum! Brands you should be aware of, and 2 of them are a bit unpleasant.

BrandsYum! Brands, Friday, February 10, 2023, Press release pictureTaco Bell BlogAt Taco Bell, we empower our teams to be fearless, embrace different and drive change. We believe that each one of us has a story to tell.This year's nationwide Black History Month's focus is Black Resistance - meaning how the Black community has resisted historic and ongoing oppression, which you can learn more about on blackhistorymonth.gov.To honor and celebrate this year's focus and the Black community, we will continue to amplify their voices. We will share their stories every Tuesday in the month of February in hopes that they not only educate but inspire you to drive positive impact within your community.But first, some Black History background... Black History Month started off as a one-week celebration founded by Carter G Woodson in February 1926. 50 years later the week was transformed into a month-long celebration of Black American history. February is the month we dedicate to celebrate and share stories about our Black team members and communities who triumphed despite ongoing challenges.Throughout the year, we will continue sharing the incredible stories of our Taco Bell teams; the sharing and celebration doesn't stop here.WEEK 1Sherron H., Director Of Talent Acquisition At The Taco Bell HQSherron graduated from UC Santa Barbara and is a Graduate Member of Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) Sorority, Inc. - Theta Mu Omega Chapter. She also received her SHRM Certificate at CSU Dominguez Hills. She currently resides in southern California, is a mom to two girls and has been married for 22 years! They have a Blue Nose Pitbull named Nala that they rescued in 2020. ""It was the best thing we accidentally did for our family,"" she said.But when you dive deeper into who Sherron is and her passion - it all comes back to people, which made pursuing Human Resources (HR) a no brainer.Before Sherron joined Taco Bell, she had 25+ years of experience under her belt. From leading and building recruiting teams to specializing in HR-focused programs like Talent Selection and Recruitment, Development and Engagement, and Diversity and Inclusion Training (just to name a few) ... she's had an impressive career.Story continuesAlong the way, she had always heard about Taco Bell's culture, so when she received a LinkedIn message about a position in the company, she knew that it was an opportunity she had to take.""I was immediately interested. I've been preparing my whole career to do this work... I took on extra projects, created new initiatives, joined professional organizations, earned a SHRM certification - all because I wanted to make an impact.""So as soon as she started her role at The Bell as Director of RSC Recruiting, she hit the ground running. Something that Sherron came to realize throughout her career in HR is that many people from underrepresented communities didn't apply for many roles, so she made it her goal to ensure equitable and inclusive hiring processes and she continues those efforts at The Bell.When we asked her what Black History Month means to her, she said, ""It is a time to reflect and appreciate all the many ways that Black people have contributed to this country."" And when we asked about addressing the issues that impact underrepresented communities, she said, ""We should address it with honesty. We have centuries of systems to undo, change will not be overnight. Honesty requires a level of discomfort for everyone. However, with action behind words, grace behind truth and a willingness to face hard facts, we can make change. A room of diverse races, genders, experience, ability, backgrounds and beliefs is a room I want to sit in.""Sherron radiates this passion and pours it into her goal of continuing to build a diverse and talented Taco Bell team all while keeping a Restlessly Creative mindset - she hopes that this is the legacy she'll be known for at The Bell. But none of that comes without investing in yourself.""Invest in learning your role, network with others in your field and learn about the other aspects that influence your work. And never stop asking questions,"" she said.Like we said before, Sherron is about the people. She believes in the importance representation plays for the communities we serve, and that motivates her and drives her passion to provide even more job opportunities that might seem challenging for underrepresented communities.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

Next week’s earnings lineup features quite a few stocks that appear to trade at discounts considering their affordable price tags and fundamental metrics.Let’s see if it’s time to pounce on the opportunity to buy these stocks at their current levels.ClevelandCliffs (CLF)Starting the list is Cleveland-Cliffs which is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 14. Cleveland-Cliffs is the largest producer of iron ore pellets and flat-rolled steel in North America.With a specific niche among its industry, Cleveland-Cliffs stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in correlation with earnings estimates rising 87% over the last quarter for fiscal 2023 as the company rounds out its FY22.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Cleveland-Cliffs has been dealing with lingering maintenance costs as Q4 earnings are expected at -$0.33 per share, compared to EPS of $1.78 in Q4 2021 which capped off a record year for income and revenue.Fiscal 2022 earnings are now projected to drop -55% to $2.61 per share after an exceptional 2021 with EPS at $5.87. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to decline another -20% to $2.08 per share but estimates are much higher.   On the top line, Q4 sales are forecasted to be $5.35 billion and virtually flat from a year ago. Total sales are now anticipated to be up 14% for FY22 but decline -12% in FY23 to $20.45 billion. However, Fiscal 2023 sales would still be a very impressive 733% increase over the last five years with 2018 sales at $2.33 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates that Cleveland-Cliffs could miss on its Q4 bottom-line with the Most Accurate Estimate at -$0.37 per share and the Zacks Consensus having EPS at -$0.33.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Despite a down quarter, the rising earnings estimates for Cleveland-Cliffs fiscal 2023 is very intriguing and allude to the possibility of a stronger outlook for the year. With guidance being more important than anything this earnings season, CLF stock also makes the case for being somewhat undervalued at 9.5X forward earnings and sports an “A” Style Scores grade for Value.Story continuesPlus, the correction in Cleveland-Cliffs stock last year may be a long-term buying opportunity considering its niche as an iron and steel producer with CLF shares up +166% over the last three years to blast the S&amp;P 500’s +23%.Herbalife (HLF)Another company whose stock makes that case for being a bargain at its current levels is Herbalife which is also set to report Q4 earnings on Tuesday, February 14.Herbalife is a global network marketing company that offers a wide range of science-based management products, nutritional supplements, and personal care products to support weight loss and health.Trading at $16 oer share and just 7X forward earnings, Herbalife stock sports an “A” Style Scores grade for Value and lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. Shares of HLF trade 67% below its decade high of 21.4X and at a 42% discount to the median of 12.2X.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Herbalife’s Q4 EPS is expected at $0.26 a share, down -54% from $0.57 per share in Q4 2021. This would round out fiscal 2022 earnings at $2.94 per share, compared to EPS of $4.79 a share in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to dip another -11% to $2.62 per share but earnings estimates revisions are up 14% in the week leading up to its quarterly release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFourth-quarter sales are forecasted to be $1.12 billion, down -15% from the prior year quarter. Total sales would be down -11% YoY for FY22 and are projected to drop another -9% in FY23 to $4.67 billion. It is important to note that FY23 would reflect -4% growth over the last five years with 2018 sales at $4.89 billion.   Earnings ESP: Despite the annual dip in its bottom line, Herbalife may significantly top Q4 earnings expectations with The Zacks Consensus at $0.26 per share and the Most Accurate Consensus at $0.37 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: While Herbalife’s annual top and bottom line growth has contracted, at its current levels the stock could be moving towards oversold territory. The possibility of an earnings beat and better-than-expected guidance as FY23 earnings estimates have soared could lead to a rally in Herbalife shares and for now holding on to the stock could be rewarding down the line.TripAdvisor (TRIP) Rounding out the list is TripAdvisor which is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on February 14. TripAdvisor is one of the largest online travel research companies in the world and could start benefiting from a booming industry as travel demand is expected to be higher in 2023.To that note, TripAdvisor’s broader Internet-Commerce Industry is currently in the top 18% of over 250 Zacks Industries. TripAdvisor stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and trades attractively relative to its past despite trading at 43.4X forward earnings. This is well below its extreme decade-long high of 3,600X and nicely below the median of 48.9X with earnings expected to rebound.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: TripAdvisor’s Q4 earnings are expected to be up at $0.05 per share compared to EPS of -$0.01 in Q4 2021. Overall, fiscal 2022 earnings are now projected to be up to $0.62 per share with EPS at -$0.30 in 2021.Even better, fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to climb another 103% to $1.26 per share. On the top line, Q4 sales are forecasted to be $343.79 million, up 42% from the prior year quarter. Total sales are now forecasted to jump 64% for FY22 and rise another 17% in FY23 to $1.73 billion. More importantly, FY23 sales would be 11% above pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $1.56 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates that TripAdvisor could top Q4 bottom-line expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.11 per share and the Zacks Consensus having EPS at $0.05.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: With TripAdvisor stock trading attractively relative to its past from a valuation standpoint, a strong earnings beat and positive guidance could lead to more upside. Shares of TripAdvisor have rallied 34% to start the year largely outperforming the broader indexes.The company’s outlook will be important during its quarterly release, and for now, holding on to TripAdvisor stock could pay off as we move closer to the peak travel months during the summer.Bottom Line These three stocks are starting to stand out from a valuation standpoint as they look to recover from the broader economic challenges and higher operating costs. Monitoring the guidance and outlook they offer in their quarterly reports will be important, as positive commentary in this regard could help these stocks soar from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

282,c609ab3d-aba9-3b3b-8cc1-7b8a68eb7709,TRIP,2023-02-11,The 3 Most Underrated Stocks to Buy For Maximum Gains,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-underrated-stocks-buy-181544748.html,1675793744,STORY,"['LAC', 'CPNG', 'TRIP']","[I firmly believe that 2023 will be a year for careful stock selection, rather than expecting broad indices to perform. Several stocks are ones I’d call under-the-radar hidden gems with multi-bagger upside potential. At the same time, there are visible but underrated stocks that can outperform as well.The market’s nature is to follow a cycle of euphoria, decline, and consolidation. Underrated stocks would typically be names that have not seen euphoria. However, these stocks are often out of favor due to industry or company-specific headwinds. Their valuations are attractive, and positive business developments reinforce a bullish view from value investors.I also believe that there are a number of underrated stocks with the potential to deliver at least 100% returns over the next 12 months. These stocks are worth holding even beyond this period, as they represent attractive businesses with long-term cash flow growth potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss three underrated stocks that are poised for a meaningful rally in 2023.CPNGCoupang$16.61TRIPTripadvisor$24.16LACLithium Americas$25.75Coupang (CPNG)The Coupang (CPNG stock) campus in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comE-commerce stocks have been among the hottest stocks in the post-pandemic era. However, after a 2022 beat down, many of these previous high-flyers are now trading at attractive valuations. Indeed, Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) is one such stock I’d put in this bucket, and it makes my list of underrated stocks to buy for this reason.For 2023, the critical catalyst many view as necessary for CPNG stock is sustained EBITDA margin expansion. In Q3 2022, Coupang reported a product commerce EBITDA margin of 4.8%. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the company’s margin expanded by 280 basis points. With operating leverage, Coupang is likely to move closer to its long-term EBITDA margin target of 7% to 10%.That’s good. However, it’s also worth noting that Coupang reported cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion as of Q3 2022. Thus, the company has ample financial flexibility for expansion in Korea and other Asian markets. Coupang believes it has tapped just 50% of Korean online shoppers. Therefore, there is plenty of headroom for revenue growth.Story continuesOverall, Coupang has the potential to deliver robust cash flows in the coming years. After some consolidation below the $20 level, CPNG stock is poised for a big breakout rally.Tripadvisor (TRIP)image of mobile phone screen displaying tripadvisor logo (TRIP)Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comTripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), the world’s largest travel guidance platform, looks attractive. TRIP stock has corrected by 14% over the past 12 months, and the company’s downside seems capped at its recent levels, around $24. With the renewed surge in global travel and tourism following the pandemic, the upside potential for TRIP stock is significant.Among the positives I’m looking at is the company’s revenue growth. Tripadvisor reported revenue of $459 million as of Q3 2022, which was 107% higher over the quarterly level reported in 2019. Thus, not only has Tripadvisor surpassed tis pre-pandemic levels in terms of revenue, but it has seen improvement in its adjusted EBITDA margin as well. I expect this margin improvement to be sustained in 2023.Another fundamental to note is Tripadvisor’s free cash flow of $46 million for Q3 2022. Currently, the company’s annualized FCF potential is around $200 million. Tripadvisor also has $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. With substantial financial flexibility and an improving industry outlook, I expect Tripadvisor to pursue inorganic growth. Besides the company’s core business, Tripadvisor is already generating healthy revenue from Viator and TheFork.Lithium Americas (LAC)smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screenSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comGiven the impending lithium supply gap, lithium stocks are an attractive investment theme. However, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock has underperformed with negative returns of 12% in the last year. Thus, I think it’s among the list of underrated stocks poised to surge higher in 2023 and beyond.In an important development for the company, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Lithium Americas agreed to jointly develop the Thacker Pass project. The former will make an equity investment of $650 million in Lithium Americas, which is significant consider the asset’s net present value of $4.95 billion. Once commercial operations commence, it will be a cash flow machine for the company.Lithium Americas has also decided to split its business into two entities. The company’s U.S. assets will fall under Lithium Americas, and international investments will be under Lithium International. I believe the split will unlock value and make access to funding relatively easier.With quality assets and high financial flexibility, Lithium Americas is poised to create tremendous value in the coming years.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Georgia Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Georgia would be the 27th biggest economy in the world with a GDP of $692 billion in 2021 which makes it bigger than Poland, Sweden, Belgium and Ireland. The 8th most populous state in the country, Georgia is one of only 15 states with a AAA rating. It is home to many major companies some of which are the biggest companies in the world in their own industries. The state is also home to the busiest airport in the world in Atlanta both in terms of aircraft traffic and passenger traffic in the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport while it is also home to one of the biggest seaports in North America.25 biggest Georgia companies and stocksCopyright: sepavo / 123RF Stock PhotoAtlanta, the capital of Georgia, is one of the most important global cities in the world not just because of having the biggest airport but being home to many major industries which include finance, insurance, technology, real estate manufacturing, logistics and communications. The biggest producer of pecans in the world, Georgia is home to a major agricultural industry and is among the biggest blueberry producers in the country too.In the last one year, Georgia has seen its unemployment rate decline by 0.3%, from 3.3% in November 2021 to 3% in November 2022 which is the 14th best rate for any state. However, even this is not as good as the 2.8% that the state reached for three straight months but with a recession imminent, a slight increase shouldn't be seen as something outlier. Before the pandemic struck, Georgia's unemployment rate was at a historic low of 3.1% before climbing to 12.6% in just two months when the effect of the pandemic was fully felt. Clawing this back to 3% shows the progress the state has made in recovering from the pandemic which should help it navigate economic headwinds heading into 2023.Story continuesTo encourage businesses and their growth in Georgia, which includes various tax credits that allow you to reduce tax credits and is considered to be the first state in the Southeast to use single-factor appointment, which means that the corporate tax rate will be calculated only based on sales made inside Georgia. Some of the tax credits provided by the state, which has definitely helped some of the biggest Georgia companies and stocks, ranges from $1,250 to $4,000 per year for 5 years for every new job that the company creates.The 25 biggest Georgia companies and stocks have combined revenues of over $530 billion while the total market cap exceeds $1.2 trillion.

Let's dive into a few hot Yahoo Finance tickers. We're watching Newell Brands as it reported another soft quarter, as people remain fully stocked with Rubbermaid containers from the pandemic. Also noteworthy here, CEO and friend of our show, Ravi Saligram, is retiring. So let's just start on the quarter here. A very challenging quarter for Newell Brands. Sales down across the board. Notably, in the home appliances segment, sales down 17.3%. The home solutions segment, which contains Yankee Candle, those sales were down 12.8%.The company is now undergoing a restructuring plan, putting forth a couple of weeks ago by Saligram, who will be retiring. And we just had him on a couple of months ago, and a big push for Ravi was product innovation, rebooting the innovation pipeline for this company and doing things a lot better, coming out with cool stuff. And we actually-- he actually showed off one product he reinvented. Take a listen.RAVI SALIGRAM: This is the Sharpie S Gel, one of my favorite products in our company. And Sharpie has been always known for permanent markers and really all about creative expression. But the brand has so much equity. So we launched this two years ago. And in two years, it's become a $50 million brand, and with great gross margins. And people absolutely love it.BRIAN SOZZI: And, Brad, I know you're a big fan of the pen, big fan.BRAD SMITH: I have the pen--BRIAN SOZZI: You're still using it.BRAD SMITH: --right here. Ravi, this one's for you. This is a solid pen, best pen I've used here on set before. And quite frankly, it's just smooth like butter.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: It might be smooth like butter, but their-- their numbers didn't look that great.BRIAN SOZZI: Go ahead, Julie, [INAUDIBLE].JULIE HYMAN: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.BRAD SMITH: The pen, it's about--BRIAN SOZZI: We like Ravi. We like Ravi.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Of course, we like Ravi. He's a friend of the show. Unfortunately, his business is not doing that great. Appliance sales down 26% last quarter. Home solution sales down 16%. I don't know which of those pens-- which part-- which unit pens are in.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, the new-- [LAUGHS] the new CEO Chris Peterson, he was the interim CEO just before Ravi came into the company. So he's been around since 2018. Has a clear-- I guess he knows what's going on with the turnaround plan. He will be executing that as well. But importantly, he has a very strong understanding of the numbers, too, having been CFO.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, one of the interesting things that they called out, too, inventory levels-- higher inventory levels driven by a pullback in retailer orders, slowing consumer demands, lower accounts payable due to the timing of supply plan reductions as well. And they had reduced their inventories by about $400 million between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year here. So--BRIAN SOZZI: It is a nice pen.BRAD SMITH: It's a great pen.BRIAN SOZZI: It is nice.BRAD SMITH: Isn't it just--JULIE HYMAN: It's a great pen. Maybe they can write a better forecast with--BRIAN SOZZI: Oh! Jules!JULIE HYMAN: Sorry. The forecast for the year is lousy. Their net sales are going to be, at most, 8.6 billion. Analysts were looking for 9.06 billion. I'm sorry, guys.[BELL RINGING]I got to-- I got to.]"

Rowe Price Group (NASDAQ:TROW) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $1.22,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-group-nasdaq-121143754.html,1676117503,STORY,['TROW'],"[The board of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) has announced that the dividend on 30th of March will be increased to $1.22, which will be 1.7% higher than last year's payment of $1.20 which covered the same period. This takes the dividend yield to 4.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with. View our latest analysis for T. Rowe Price Group T. Rowe Price Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The last payment made up 71% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 3.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 78%, which is on the higher side, but certainly still feasible.historic-dividendT. Rowe Price Group Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.36, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $4.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.T. Rowe Price Group May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 2.3% per year. Slow growth and a high payout ratio could mean that T. Rowe Price Group has maxed out the amount that it has been able to pay to shareholders. This isn't the end of the world, but for investors looking for strong dividend growth they may want to look elsewhere.T. Rowe Price Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for T. Rowe Price Group that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas? Try our collection of strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article?

I was about to have my teenage daughter do mine anyway — she needs community service hours for school.And I’m not alone.

MLM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 15, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1% and revenues (products and services) topped the same by 0.6%. On a year-over-year basis, the earnings of this aggregates producer increased 10.4%. Products and services revenues rose 14.9%. Total quarterly revenues (including Product and Services and Freight revenues) were up 16.3% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Martin Marietta’s earnings topped the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters and missed on the other two occasions, with the average negative surprise being 8.1%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Martin Marietta’s fourth-quarter earnings has decreased to $3.02 from $3.26 per share in the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a 4.1% decrease on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.42 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 1.3%.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteMartin Marietta’s quarterly revenues are expected to have witnessed year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, given the strong pricing gains in aggregates and strength in public construction. Improved visibility in non-residential construction and contributions from acquisitions are also likely to have been the positives.The business and earnings of MLM have been sensitive to changes in construction spending, particularly housing and public construction in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida as well as Iowa. Infrastructure construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and roads and streets, might have also contributed to its performance in the quarter, as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded.Also, resilient pricing may have been a tailwind. We expect aggregate pricing to increase to $18.50, suggesting 22.6% year-over-year growth. We expect aggregate revenues to increase 13.5% year over year to $939 million.We expect cement revenues to increase 27.4% year over year to $173.4 million. Cement pricing is also expected to increase 14.4% to $145.50 per ton.However, tough year-over-year comparisons with respect to weather are expected to act as a headwind in the quarter. Notably, in the year-ago period, the weather was solid, contributing to the company’s quarterly performance.Also, inflation from hydrocarbon, rising liquid asphalt and diesel fuel costs, more transportation costs and insurance and labor cost may have impacted the bottom line of Martin Marietta and its peers like Vulcan Materials Company VMC. Also, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs, supply and contract costs and supply-chain bottlenecks are added concerns.Other ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Building Material segment revenues (product and services), which comprises 95% of total revenues, is pegged at $1,382 million, implying growth from $1,337 million a year ago.The consensus estimate for Magnesia Specialties revenues (product and services) is currently pegged at $70 million, suggesting a year-over-year growth from $68 million reported a year ago.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Martin Marietta this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Currently, MLM has an Earnings ESP of -2.07% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Recent Notable ReleaseVulcan: The construction aggregates company’s focus is on four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation — which will enhance the price performance and operating efficiencies.Vulcan has been generating higher earnings despite tepid revenues due to prudent cost-control efforts and increased pricing in aggregates. Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives. However, the higher inflationary challenges and adverse weather are expected to act as headwinds.The company will report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 16, 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VMC’s fourth-quarter earnings indicates a 5.6% increase on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.82 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 13.1%.Some Recent Construction ReleasesAECOM ACM reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter fiscal 2023, where earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Post the results, shares of the technical and management support services provider slipped 0.01% on Feb 6.On a year-over-year basis, ACM’s bottom line declined despite top-line growth. The company’s strong top-line performance was backed by strong organic NSR growth.Otis Worldwide Corporation OTIS reported solid fourth-quarter 2022 results.

298,78c8b638-2290-32de-aef9-2525f5c09849,BSX,2023-02-11,Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) Stock Is Going Strong But Fundamentals Look Uncertain: What Lies Ahead ?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-corporation-nyse-bsx-120026264.html,1676116826,STORY,['BSX'],"[Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 11% over the last three months. But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. In this article, we decided to focus on Boston Scientific's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Scientific How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Boston Scientific is:4.0% = US$698m ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.04 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Boston Scientific's Earnings Growth And 4.0% ROEAs you can see, Boston Scientific's ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 4.1% seen by Boston Scientific was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Boston Scientific's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 17% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for BSX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Boston Scientific Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Because Boston Scientific doesn't pay any dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Boston Scientific's performance. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

299,9e1bea88-375c-3a10-bd4b-28284626ca06,BSX,2023-02-11,25 Biggest Massachusetts Companies and Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-biggest-massachusetts-companies-stocks-184027168.html,1676054427,STORY,"['AMT', 'BJ', 'BIIB', 'HOLX', 'CLH', 'KDP', 'VRTX', 'CRL', 'IRM', 'MRNA', 'TER', 'STT', 'ADI', 'W', 'BSX', 'GLP-PB', 'PKI', 'ES']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Massachusetts would be 32nd largest economy in the world based on a 2021 GDP of $641 billion, which makes it bigger than Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Austria. The economy of Massachusetts is strongly based on technological research and development as well as the service sector, which dictates a major switch from its preindustrial economy which was largely dependent on agriculture and maritime trade. That is not to say that agriculture isn't an important contributor as it definitely is; it's just that it isn't as significant to the state's economy as it used to be. The pharmaceutical industry has a major presence in the state as well and several of the biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks are pharma / biotech companies.Education has always been considered important in Massachusetts and this should come as no surprise considering the fact that the oldest and one of the most prestigious ranked universities in Harvard University is located in the state. In addition, the state is considered to be a pioneer in kindergarten and secondary education as well, and this historic focus on education is no double linked to the success of the state in various metrics including being among the biggest states in the country.25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocksMarcio Jose Bastos Silva/Shutterstock.comIn November 2022, the unemployment rate of Massachusetts was 3.4%, which ranks it 22nd among all U.S. states. According to Boston Indicators, Massachusetts started to drop into recession after the Covid-19 pandemic hit but posted a quick and strong recovery which was needed after unemployment increased to a record 16% in April 2020. Even in 2022, the unemployment rate has continued to drop as it was 3.9% in 2021, and over half a million jobs have been regained since 2020. However, there are still challenges remaining relating to unemployment which includes an outflux of workers, and higher unemployment for minorities.Story continuesRight now, Massachusetts is moving more slowly than other New England states as the aforementioned labor outflux has exacerbated labor supply issues while higher interest rates have negatively impacted high growth companies such as tech and research and development, which we mentioned were the main sectors in the state. On the other hand, the professional services sector, which employs the highest number of people in the state, has posted a strong recovery in 2022.To encourage growth of businesses, Massachusetts provides several tax and other benefits including tax credits for cleaning up contaminated property, credits for investing in housing development projects, tax credits for taxpayers and businesses which make cash contributions to investment projects, and the Economic Development Incentive Program Credit to create and stimulate business within Massachusetts.The 25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks have a combined revenue of $486 billion and a market cap exceeding $1.22 trillion with three companies worth more than $100 billion headquartered in the state. To determine these companies, we obtained the 25 largest companies in the state from Fortune 500 based on revenue and determined their market cap from Yahoo finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap, and where the company wasn't listed, assigned it a ranking based on revenue alone.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Ulta Beauty (ULTA).Ulta currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy, representing 70% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for ULTABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ULTACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Ulta here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Ulta, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is ULTA a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Ulta, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $22.95.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Ulta. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Ulta may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is not to say that agriculture isn't an important contributor as it definitely is; it's just that it isn't as significant to the state's economy as it used to be. The pharmaceutical industry has a major presence in the state as well and several of the biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks are pharma / biotech companies.Education has always been considered important in Massachusetts and this should come as no surprise considering the fact that the oldest and one of the most prestigious ranked universities in Harvard University is located in the state. In addition, the state is considered to be a pioneer in kindergarten and secondary education as well, and this historic focus on education is no double linked to the success of the state in various metrics including being among the biggest states in the country.25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocksMarcio Jose Bastos Silva/Shutterstock.comIn November 2022, the unemployment rate of Massachusetts was 3.4%, which ranks it 22nd among all U.S. states. According to Boston Indicators, Massachusetts started to drop into recession after the Covid-19 pandemic hit but posted a quick and strong recovery which was needed after unemployment increased to a record 16% in April 2020. Even in 2022, the unemployment rate has continued to drop as it was 3.9% in 2021, and over half a million jobs have been regained since 2020. However, there are still challenges remaining relating to unemployment which includes an outflux of workers, and higher unemployment for minorities.Story continuesRight now, Massachusetts is moving more slowly than other New England states as the aforementioned labor outflux has exacerbated labor supply issues while higher interest rates have negatively impacted high growth companies such as tech and research and development, which we mentioned were the main sectors in the state. On the other hand, the professional services sector, which employs the highest number of people in the state, has posted a strong recovery in 2022.To encourage growth of businesses, Massachusetts provides several tax and other benefits including tax credits for cleaning up contaminated property, credits for investing in housing development projects, tax credits for taxpayers and businesses which make cash contributions to investment projects, and the Economic Development Incentive Program Credit to create and stimulate business within Massachusetts.The 25 biggest Massachusetts companies and stocks have a combined revenue of $486 billion and a market cap exceeding $1.22 trillion with three companies worth more than $100 billion headquartered in the state. To determine these companies, we obtained the 25 largest companies in the state from Fortune 500 based on revenue and determined their market cap from Yahoo finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap, and where the company wasn't listed, assigned it a ranking based on revenue alone.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Georgia Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Georgia would be the 27th biggest economy in the world with a GDP of $692 billion in 2021 which makes it bigger than Poland, Sweden, Belgium and Ireland. The 8th most populous state in the country, Georgia is one of only 15 states with a AAA rating. It is home to many major companies some of which are the biggest companies in the world in their own industries.

Before the pandemic struck, Georgia's unemployment rate was at a historic low of 3.1% before climbing to 12.6% in just two months when the effect of the pandemic was fully felt. Clawing this back to 3% shows the progress the state has made in recovering from the pandemic which should help it navigate economic headwinds heading into 2023.Story continuesTo encourage businesses and their growth in Georgia, which includes various tax credits that allow you to reduce tax credits and is considered to be the first state in the Southeast to use single-factor appointment, which means that the corporate tax rate will be calculated only based on sales made inside Georgia.

Munger is well known for dramatically shifting Buffett’s investing ideology, and Buffett credits him for his success in the second half of his career.Warren Buffett famously quotes Munger, “Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This would alter the approach Berkshire’s investment, but likely ensured the long-term success of the conglomerate.Below, I will go over the duo’s history and successes, and at the end cover a new and very different investment they bought in the most recent quarter.Berkshire HathawayThe long-term success of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B cannot be understated. But after his amazing run though the 1960s and 70s Buffett knew, his capital was growing too large to execute his cigar-butt investing strategy. Influenced by his Columbia professor Benjamin Graham, Buffett was focused on buying $1.00 for $0.50, to get what he called a “free puff” through this period.This type of arbitrage, like many other trading strategies, would eventually run out of alpha as the strategy became more well known, and the opportunities too small for Buffetts capital. And that is where Charlie Munger became pivotal to BRK.B success. Munger advocated for buying great businesses, and holding them forever, very different from Buffett’s style. This new approach would lead to investments in American Express AXP, Moody’s MCO, and Apple AAPL and catapult Berkshire into the investing record books.A Wealth of Common Sense BlogImage Source: A Wealth of Common Sense BlogIf you remember during the post-Covid rally, many were calling Buffett and Berkshire out of touch for underperforming the market. Then 2022 came and wiped out all the easy money and speculators. This is where Berkshire showed just how robust it really is and outperformed the market, posting positive returns during one of the worst years in the stock market.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCharles T Munger – Elementary, Worldly WisdomMunger, like Buffett grew up in Omaha Nebraska, and even worked at the Buffett family grocery store, although they wouldn’t be introduced until adulthood.At Harvard Law Munger became an avid poker player where he developed what he called an “important skill,” which would benefit his business career.He would go on to start the well-known law firm, Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson. But law wasn’t enough for Munger, and he would begin his investing career with several very successful real estate developments in California. Following that he started his own stock investment company which was very successful in its own right, compounding at 20% over 13 years.At the time when he met Buffett, Munger was still practicing law in addition to his investing career, but Buffett would convince him to quit and join him, to focus all his time on investing. The rest is history.Munger credits much of his success to his interest in history, philosophy, and his penchant for “uncommon sense.” He believes good businesses are ethical businesses.If you ever watched Munger speak publicly you will know that he is very crotchety and extremely funny. But then he will say things that are so incredibly profound, often quoting many historical thinkers.He is also very well known for his concept of inversion. The principle can be well defined by his quote, ""All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there."" Munger’s InvestmentsThis concept of “buying wonderful businesses at fair prices,” would be the guide for a number Berkshire’s best investments.Possibly one of the greatest investments of all time was when Berkshire bought Apple. When Munger and Buffett bought AAPL stock in 2016, the company was quite mature, and expectations for future returns were not exceptional. The iPhone had already been a success, so what else could push the stock higher.It also seemed unconventional because it was a technology business, and the duo had always shied away from technology. But it was a great franchise, and a “wonderful” company. At the time of investing AAPL traded at a P/E of 13x, not a deep value bargain, but fair.The investment would go on to earn the Berkshire $160 billion, and Buffett often cites Charlie as a very important factor in the investment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnother legendary Munger style investment was Coca-Cola KO. The crash of 1987 produced a number of investment opportunities, and KO was one of them. At the time Berkshire invested $1 billion, equivalent to a 6% stake in the company. It has since grown to $22 billion, and a 9.2% stake.This investment was also one of the earliest departures of Buffett’s original investment strategy. KO was a great company, trading at a fair valuation. Coca-Cola dominated the beverage industry, had global recognition, and was a nearly 100 year old brand at the time. There were huge opportunities in 1987 to trade “cigar butts,” but instead they opted to make a long-term investment.Berkshire’s Newest InvestmentBerkshire’s most recent 13F report shows it built a $4 billion stake in Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, the world’s largest producer of semiconductors. TSM is an amazing company, with a long history of success. The stock has returned 15% annualized since 1998 and is essential to the technology industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stock has fallen out of favor over the last year though, at the worst point correcting 60% off its 2021 high. It has since recovered but is still well off its highs.TSM along with the rest of the semiconductor industry is experiencing some painful drawdowns after an exceptional couple of years. The boom that followed Covid led to a tremendous oversupply of semis, which is what has hit the industry. But there are few sectors that have tailwinds like semis do. The digital economy is one of the strongest secular trends there is.Munger and Buffett have invested when sentiment on the stock is low, a brilliant contrarian decision further favoring the investment decision.TSM is a very well-known franchise and an amazing business. The stock currently trades at a one year forward P/E of 17X, just below is 5-year median of 19x. This isn’t a crazy bargain, but great companies rarely trade at deep discounts. Just as Munger says, buy great businesses at good prices.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionCharlie Munger is a sage investor, worth exploring and learning as much as possible from. His method is simple, rooted in reasonable thinking, and history. His approach to buying great companies at good prices influenced one of the greatest investors of all time to completely change his approach to markets.Munger is also the chairman of a small legal publication and software company called Daily Journal Co DJCO. Not surprisingly he has used his philosophy to dramatically improve the company, and set it on a path to success.DJCO reports earnings Friday, February 10 after the market close, and Munger often uses the report to make a public statement about the markets.

310,822de2e7-dda8-3720-ace0-4b438f651c0c,KO,2023-02-11,3 Great Compounder Stocks to Buy for Strong Returns in All Environments,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-great-compounder-stocks-buy-175905978.html,1676051945,STORY,['KO'],"[Today’s macroeconomic and geopolitical environment feels particularly uncertain. Owning stocks with robust business models that generate strong returns, with minimal cyclicality are one safe place to invest in 2023.Compounder stocks are companies that can deliver sustainable long-term growth across different types of economic environments. Three that look like they have near term bullish catalysts will be covered below.What is a Compounder Stock?A compounder stock is a company with high return on invested capital, a robust franchise, recurring revenues, intangible assets, pricing power, and low capital intensity. These are companies that have exhibited exceptional long-term returns, and regularly outperform during economic downturns. They remain resilient during tough economic times because their products are necessities, with wide margins, and very regular purchases or usage.The chart below shows the ten-year returns of a few well-known compounders and demonstrates the kind of performance they can produce. These include Mastercard MA, Alphabet GOOGL, Costco COST, and United Healthcare UNH.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisaVisa V is a quintessential compounder stock. Visa boasts gross margins of 99%, net margins of 50%, and functions essentially as a tax on debit or credit card purchases. Using Visa products is a non-discretionary decision, and Visa cards are sometimes used multiple times per day, whether it’s a recession or boom time.Visa currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating strong earnings revisions trends. V is also in the lower range of its historical valuation. With a one-year forward P/E of 26x it is well off its 10-year high of 38x, and right in line with its historical median of 26x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMSCIData and information-based companies can make outstanding business models, and MSCI is one of the best. Similar to S&amp;P Global and Moody’s Co MCO, two fellow compounders, financial data and indexing is a category of business that is above the rest.Story continuesFinancial professionals will never stop needing data to do their jobs, and they need that data updated daily, if not more frequently. Financial firms also tend to make a lot of money, so spending on data is never a question for them. Even better for MSCI is that the need for accurate and abundant data is only growing. Increasingly specific, and granular data is required for good financial and investment research.MSCI also enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). All timeframes, including current quarter, current year, next quarter and next year have experienced consistent revisions higher in earnings over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKOCoca-Cola KO is kind of a sleeper compounder, but still a great one. Many people think that KO is a beverage company, but really Coca-Cola is more than that. KO is an intellectual property, licensing, and marketing company.The majority of Coca-Cola production is actually outsourced to other beverage producers. Another fun fact is that the majority of KO’s profits actually come from selling the syrup, rather than cans or bottles of its famous beverages.KO currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and offers a handsome dividend yield of 3%.Coca-Cola stock also proved its resiliency over the last year, well outperforming the broad market, and posting positive returns during one of the most challenging years in stock market history.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineCompounder stocks can sometimes be difficult to pull the trigger on. Not because they aren’t clearly good businesses, but because they can appear to be too expensive. And that is a reasonable concern, nobody wants to overpay. But because these are such premium stocks, that can often carry premium valuations.Periods of extended selloffs, or full-on bear markets like we have been experiencing recently can be amazing opportunities to buy shares in these high return stocks. Furthermore, in economic environments of slowing growth, and decreasing liquidity, these stocks can fundamentally protect portfolios.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

311,d2b534b5-6680-3726-9226-bf14015d420e,KO,2023-02-11,Will Coke (KO) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coke-ko-beat-estimates-again-171005188.html,1676049005,STORY,['KO'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Coca-Cola (KO), which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry.When looking at the last two reports, this world's largest beverage maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 6.15%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Coke was expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share, but it reported $0.69 per share instead, representing a surprise of 7.81%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.67 per share, while it actually produced $0.70 per share, a surprise of 4.48%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Coke, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Coke has an Earnings ESP of +0.75% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 14, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Georgia Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Georgia would be the 27th biggest economy in the world with a GDP of $692 billion in 2021 which makes it bigger than Poland, Sweden, Belgium and Ireland. The 8th most populous state in the country, Georgia is one of only 15 states with a AAA rating. It is home to many major companies some of which are the biggest companies in the world in their own industries. The state is also home to the busiest airport in the world in Atlanta both in terms of aircraft traffic and passenger traffic in the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport while it is also home to one of the biggest seaports in North America.25 biggest Georgia companies and stocksCopyright: sepavo / 123RF Stock PhotoAtlanta, the capital of Georgia, is one of the most important global cities in the world not just because of having the biggest airport but being home to many major industries which include finance, insurance, technology, real estate manufacturing, logistics and communications. The biggest producer of pecans in the world, Georgia is home to a major agricultural industry and is among the biggest blueberry producers in the country too.In the last one year, Georgia has seen its unemployment rate decline by 0.3%, from 3.3% in November 2021 to 3% in November 2022 which is the 14th best rate for any state. However, even this is not as good as the 2.8% that the state reached for three straight months but with a recession imminent, a slight increase shouldn't be seen as something outlier. Before the pandemic struck, Georgia's unemployment rate was at a historic low of 3.1% before climbing to 12.6% in just two months when the effect of the pandemic was fully felt. Clawing this back to 3% shows the progress the state has made in recovering from the pandemic which should help it navigate economic headwinds heading into 2023.Story continuesTo encourage businesses and their growth in Georgia, which includes various tax credits that allow you to reduce tax credits and is considered to be the first state in the Southeast to use single-factor appointment, which means that the corporate tax rate will be calculated only based on sales made inside Georgia. Some of the tax credits provided by the state, which has definitely helped some of the biggest Georgia companies and stocks, ranges from $1,250 to $4,000 per year for 5 years for every new job that the company creates.The 25 biggest Georgia companies and stocks have combined revenues of over $530 billion while the total market cap exceeds $1.2 trillion.

MHK reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2022. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the metric declined year over year.Net sales also missed the consensus mark and declined from the prior year owing to prevailing industry headwinds. Mohawk Industries’ shares dropped 2.12% in the after-hours trading session on Feb 9.Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum, chairman and CEO of Mohawk, said, “The flooring industry is slowing due to higher interest rates, sustained inflation and low consumer confidence. Visibility of the depth and duration of this cycle is limited, and conditions differ across the world. Mohawk has a strong record of managing through these downturns by proactively executing the necessary actions. We are adjusting our business for the current conditions by reducing production levels, inventory, cost structures and capital expenditures. We are implementing restructuring actions in both Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World to streamline operations, reduce SG&amp;A and rationalize higher cost assets.”Inside the NumbersMohawk reported adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share, which topped the consensus mark of $1.29 by 2.3%. The metric plunged from $2.95 per share, reflecting a fall of 55.3% year over year. The decline was due to intense inflation, higher interest rates and lower volume.Mohawk Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMohawk Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMohawk Industries, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Mohawk Industries, Inc. QuoteNet sales of $2.65 billion lagged the consensus estimate of $2.72 billion by 2.6% and decreased 4% from the year-ago figure of $2.76 billion. On a constant-currency basis, net sales were down 1.3% year over year. Price increases and strength in the commercial channel, which benefited from ongoing remodeling and new construction projects, were offset by a slowdown in residential flooring sales. Residential flooring sales contracted due to rising interest rates, declining home sales and lower consumer confidence.Story continuesOperating HighlightsAdjusted gross profit of $594.4 million was down 19.7% year over year. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses improved 1.3% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating income totaled $119.2 million, which declined 53.9% year over year.Segment DetailsGlobal Ceramic: Sales in the segment totaled $987.7 million, up 4% year over year. Also, the metric improved 5.2% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted operating income increased to $70.1 million from $60.4 million a year ago. The segment’s adjusted operating margin was 7.1%. The upside was primarily due to improved pricing and product mix as well as productivity gains, partially offset by inflation and lower volumes.Flooring North America: Net sales at the segment amounted to $946 million, down 6.8% year over year on a reported basis. The segment registered an adjusted operating loss of $0.78 million for the quarter versus adjusted operating income of $92.9 million reported in the prior-year period. Operating margin was negative 3.1% and adjusted operating margin was flat in the quarter. Favorable price and mix were partially offset by inflation, temporary plant shutdowns and lower volumes.Flooring Rest of the World: Net sales in the segment decreased 9.9% year over year to $717 million. On a constant-currency basis, sales were down 1.9% from the year-ago level. Adjusted operating income was $55.5 million, down from $117.4 million reported a year ago. The segment’s operating margin was 5% and 7.7% on an adjusted basis. Pricing and mix improvements were offset by inflation, lower volumes and temporary plant shutdowns.2022 HighlightsAdjusted earnings came in at $12.85 per share, down 13.5% from $14.86 a year ago. Net sales were $11.7 billion, up 4.8% on a reported basis and 8.8% on a constant currency and days basis. Operating income for the year totaled $244.2 million and adjusted EBITDA was $254.4 million.Financial HighlightsAt 2022-end, MHK had available liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a low net debt to EBITDA of 1.3x.As of Dec 31, 2022, it had cash and cash equivalents of $509.6 million compared with $268.9 million at 2021-end. The long-term debt — less current portion — at 2022-end was $1.98 billion compared with $1.7 billion at December 2021-end.For 2022, the company generated free cash flow of $595.5 million, slightly up from $591.7 million a year ago.First-Quarter 2023 ViewFor the first quarter, MHK anticipates more pressure on pricing and mix due to low industry volumes, thanks to elevated inventory costs in most product categories. The company will not raise production as normal in the first quarter to prepare for future demand.Moreover, reduced energy costs will likely benefit MHK’s global margins in the future. The company expects second quarter results to be strong sequentially, with seasonally higher sales, increased production and lower material costs.For first-quarter 2023, Mohawk expects adjusted earnings to be $1.24-$1.34 per share, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges.

MLM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 15, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1% and revenues (products and services) topped the same by 0.6%. On a year-over-year basis, the earnings of this aggregates producer increased 10.4%. Products and services revenues rose 14.9%. Total quarterly revenues (including Product and Services and Freight revenues) were up 16.3% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Martin Marietta’s earnings topped the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters and missed on the other two occasions, with the average negative surprise being 8.1%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Martin Marietta’s fourth-quarter earnings has decreased to $3.02 from $3.26 per share in the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a 4.1% decrease on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.42 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 1.3%.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteMartin Marietta’s quarterly revenues are expected to have witnessed year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, given the strong pricing gains in aggregates and strength in public construction. Improved visibility in non-residential construction and contributions from acquisitions are also likely to have been the positives.The business and earnings of MLM have been sensitive to changes in construction spending, particularly housing and public construction in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida as well as Iowa. Infrastructure construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and roads and streets, might have also contributed to its performance in the quarter, as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded.Also, resilient pricing may have been a tailwind. We expect aggregate pricing to increase to $18.50, suggesting 22.6% year-over-year growth. We expect aggregate revenues to increase 13.5% year over year to $939 million.We expect cement revenues to increase 27.4% year over year to $173.4 million. Cement pricing is also expected to increase 14.4% to $145.50 per ton.However, tough year-over-year comparisons with respect to weather are expected to act as a headwind in the quarter. Notably, in the year-ago period, the weather was solid, contributing to the company’s quarterly performance.Also, inflation from hydrocarbon, rising liquid asphalt and diesel fuel costs, more transportation costs and insurance and labor cost may have impacted the bottom line of Martin Marietta and its peers like Vulcan Materials Company VMC. Also, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs, supply and contract costs and supply-chain bottlenecks are added concerns.Other ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Building Material segment revenues (product and services), which comprises 95% of total revenues, is pegged at $1,382 million, implying growth from $1,337 million a year ago.The consensus estimate for Magnesia Specialties revenues (product and services) is currently pegged at $70 million, suggesting a year-over-year growth from $68 million reported a year ago.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Martin Marietta this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Currently, MLM has an Earnings ESP of -2.07% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Recent Notable ReleaseVulcan: The construction aggregates company’s focus is on four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation — which will enhance the price performance and operating efficiencies.Vulcan has been generating higher earnings despite tepid revenues due to prudent cost-control efforts and increased pricing in aggregates. Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives. However, the higher inflationary challenges and adverse weather are expected to act as headwinds.The company will report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 16, 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VMC’s fourth-quarter earnings indicates a 5.6% increase on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.82 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 13.1%.Some Recent Construction ReleasesAECOM ACM reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter fiscal 2023, where earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Post the results, shares of the technical and management support services provider slipped 0.01% on Feb 6.On a year-over-year basis, ACM’s bottom line declined despite top-line growth. The company’s strong top-line performance was backed by strong organic NSR growth.Otis Worldwide Corporation OTIS reported solid fourth-quarter 2022 results. Its earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its quarterly results reflected strong performance, including mid-single-digit organic sales growth in New Equipment and Service and continued operating profit margin expansion in the Service business.Otis remains focused on strong portfolio growth and generating a solid New Equipment backlog. It also intends to expand operating margins, return cash to shareholders through a capital-allocation strategy and pursue additional progress toward ESG goals.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Global Insurance Companies by Market Cap.Insurance is one of the largest economic sectors in the global economy, with 105 insurers making it to the Forbes Global 2000 List in 2022. According to McKinsey, the pandemic had a substantial impact on the insurance industry: premium growth, which was more than 4% per year between 2010 and 2020, slowed to around 1.2% in 2020. At the same time, profits also declined by 15%.The industry recovered in 2021, with the Allianz Global Insurance reporting that premiums increased by 5.1% worldwide during the year. The sector’s total assets, as reported by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, stood at $44 trillion in 2021 against liabilities of $38 trillion. In 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its impact on oil and gas prices, extreme drought in food-producing parts of the world, and high inflation were all factors that affected consumer decisions about insurance. Although the final numbers are not out yet, Allianz has predicted global insurance premiums to increase by 4.8% in 2022.Biggest Global Insurance Companiesaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashThere are three main segments in the insurance industry: Life, Property and Casualty, and Health. According to Insurance Europe, in 2020, 53% of Europe's premiums came from Life, 33% came from Property and Casualty, and the rest was from the Health segment. As per a 2021 ranking, Assicurazioni Generali was the leader in life insurance, while Allianz Insurance was the leader for non-life insurance in the European market.According to KPMG, Asia Pacific markets accounted for more than 25% of worldwide premium income in 2021, driven by double-digit growth in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Rising income levels have increased awareness about insurance, and the growth of digital sales channels also allows the insurance sector to expand in Asia Pacific markets. Last year, the Indian insurer Life Insurance Corporation entered the Fortune 500 Global, demonstrating the potential of emerging Asian markets.Story continuesIn the USA, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, 47% of the total premiums came from life/annuity, and the rest was generated by property &amp; casualty. State Farm and MetLife were market leaders in P&amp;C and Life insurance, respectively.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 20 biggest global insurance companies by market cap, we identified the biggest insurance companies and ranked these companies in ascending order in order of their market cap. In the case of private companies, we have used the annual revenue of 2021 to estimate each company’s market capitalization. We used a price-to-revenue multiple for these companies to estimate the market value. We have used a price-to-revenue multiple of 1.5x, calculated by taking the average price-to-revenue multiple of the top five publicly-traded insurance companies in our list.20 Biggest Global Insurance Companies by Market Cap20.

Time now for our chart of the day. And we're looking at the rising cost of car insurance. According to bankrate.com, Americans pay an average of $2,014 per year. Meaning, they spend 2.93% of their income on car insurance prices.And these only grow. Now, the rate you pay for car insurance varies, of course, based on your personal rating factors. Your own driving history can lead to the cost reaching over $3,000 a year. Now, drivers also see the price go up based on their credit score, as those with lower credit scores are statistically more likely to file claims, which, of course, then leads to higher rates. And, of course, adding any teenagers, your favorite drivers to your account, that's also going to boost the price as the increased risk generally comes with an increase in premium.And what about the type of car? That's also being added. That will impact the price you pay. Vehicles that costs more to repair or replace will also cost more to insure.]"

The Transocean Spitsbergen rig drilled the two exploration wells.These are the third and fourth exploration wells in production license 923, awarded in APA 2017. Equinor operates the license with a 40% interest.The latest discovery is located 10 kilometers northwest of the Troll and 130 kilometers of Bergen in the northwest direction. According to preliminary estimates, the discovery holds 17-47 million barrels of recoverable oil equivalent. The majority of the discovery will likely be oil.Rover Sor marks the seventh discovery in the area since the autumn of 2019. Equinor’s other discoveries in the area are Echino Sor, Swisher, Rover Nord, Blasto, Toppand and Kveikje.Equinor and partners will consider tying the Rover Sor discovery into existing infrastructure in the Troll region. Discoveries close to the existing infrastructure are crucial to maintaining oil and gas production from the Norwegian Continental Shelf.The Troll field constitutes 40% of the total gas reserves on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Equinor operates the Troll A, B and C platforms on the field. The area’s gas reservoirs, 1,400 meters below sea level, are expected to produce for at least another 70 years.Last year, the Norway government authorized Equinor to increase production at a number of projects, including Troll. This came as a result of sanctions imposed against Russia after its aggressive invasion of Ukraine.Price PerformanceShares of Equinor have underperformed the industry in the past six months.

However, when it comes to picking stocks, it can’t hold a candle to the AI-powered equity ETF run by ETF Managers Group.The company was founded in 2014 when CEO Sam Masucci launched the business to help meet the need for thematic investing. Its first theme-based fund was the ETFMG Prime Junior Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:SILJ), which debuted in 2012. In May 2021, the ETF exceeded $1 billion in net assets.  ETF Managers Group’s AI-Powered Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:AIEQ) hasn’t quite reached that level. Launched in October 2017, it has net assets of nearly $120 million. The actively managed fund uses the proprietary EquBot quantitative model developed by EquBot to pick U.S.-listed stocks. EquBot uses IBM’s (NYSE:IBM) Watson supercomputer to do all the heavy lifting. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips“Each day, the EquBot Model ranks each company based on the probability of the company benefiting from current economic conditions, trends, and world events and identifies approximately 30 to 200 companies with the greatest potential over the next twelve months for appreciation and their corresponding weights, targeting a maximum risk adjusted return versus the broader U.S. equity market,” states the fund’s prospectus.The automated data-driven investment process eliminates bias and personal preferences from its stock selection. In 2023, AIEQ is up 14.9%, nearly double the S&amp;P 500.  Here are three top buys from the market-beating AI-Powered Equity ETF. CELHCelsius Holdings$98.13UNHUnitedHealth Group$476.91ROKURoku$62.50Celsius Holdings (CELH)A view of several cans of Celsius (CELH) energy drinks, on display at a local grocery store.Source: The Image Party / Shutterstock.comCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is AIEQ’s sixth-largest holding with a 2.1% weighting. However, the maker of energy drinks has seen a cooling off of its share price in 2023. It’s down around 5.7% year to date, but it remains up 83% over the past year. Story continuesWedbush Securities recently upgraded CELH stock to “outperform” with a $115 target price, 17% higher than where it’s currently trading.“We believe that the recent pullback in shares (which are down over 18% since 1/17/23, due to a lawsuit that will ultimately have little to no impact on company fundamentals) creates an attractive entry point for investors looking to gain exposure to the best growth story in all of [consumer products],” Wedbush analyst Gerald Pascarelli said in a note to clients.In October 2021, I suggested that Celsius was a stock to buy and hold for the next decade. While its shares slumped in early 2022, I remain confident that it’s an excellent long-term buy.  In August, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) acquired an 8.5% stake in Celsius as part of a distribution partnership that saw the beverage giant become its U.S. distributor, with worldwide distribution in the future. With Pepsi in its corner, the sky’s the limit. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comNext up is the second-largest holding in the AI-Powered Equity ETF, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), with a 3.6% weighting. Of the three stocks on my list, this has to be viewed as the defensive position of the bunch. It’s done very little over the past 52 weeks, down 2%. While that’s better than the S&amp;P 500, it’s not what shareholders have been accustomed to in recent years. UNH stock took a bit of dive early in February due to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ proposed Medicare Advantage rates for 2024. A core rate increase of 2.09% was lower than the average increase of 3.3% over the past five years. Wall Street was certainly not expecting such a low rate. But the final ruling doesn’t come until early April, so the rate may move higher by then. “While the result is disappointing, the industry has been the beneficiary of some healthy increases in recent years,” Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn wrote in a note to clients. “Additionally, we note that over the last five years, the final rule has come in 1.0% better than the proposal, on average.”So, I wouldn’t be too concerned if you are considering buying UNH stock. These things have a way of working themselves out. Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes told her clients that the proposed increase will still allow UnitedHealth and its competitors “to continue to grow in the high-single digits.”Analysts like UNH. Of the 26 covering it, 22 rate it “overweight” or “buy,” with no “underweight” or “sell” ratings. The average 12-month target price is $598.52, which is 26% higher than where it’s currently trading. Roku (ROKU)Roku logo displayed on tv screen in modern living roomSource: AhmadDanialZulhilmi / Shutterstock.comRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU), the eighth-largest holding in the AI-Powered Equity ETF at 1.9%, is performing well in 2023 following a tough 2022, during which the stock lost 82%. Up 54% year to date, the video streaming platform got some much-needed good news last week.Warner Bros. Discovery (NYSE:WBD) will move its free, ad-supported television channels to the Roku Channel. Roku needs to add content to its homegrown channel to grow its advertising revenue. This deal allows it to do precisely that. The other big news from Roku in recent weeks is the company’s push into its own line of branded smart TVs. They are expected to be out at some point in 2023. This will be another way for it to generate platform revenue from the Roku Channel. At the same time, it will enable the company to test and introduce new features on Roku TVs, Roku VP of Marketing Dan Robbins told Fierce. Most importantly, with an ad platform and operating system purpose-built for TV streaming, advertisers will be more inclined to work with Roku to access this growing piece of the TV viewing audience. In early January, Roku announced its active accounts had surpassed 7o million, up more than 16% over the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, its platform revenue grew 15% in Q3 2022 to $670.4 million, while its average revenue per user rose 10% to $44.25.More active accounts multiplied by increased streaming hours on Roku Channel translates into significant revenues. Look for Roku to continue to innovate in 2023.     On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Helen of Troy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Estee Lauder has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that HELE likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than EL has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.HELE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.60, while EL has a forward P/E of 50.87. We also note that HELE has a PEG ratio of 1.70. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Estée Lauder Companies'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:22% = US$1.5b ÷ US$6.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.22 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Estée Lauder Companies' Earnings Growth And 22% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Estée Lauder Companies has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 18% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 16% net income growth seen by Estée Lauder Companies over the past five years. growthWe then compared Estée Lauder Companies' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 28% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Estée Lauder Companies fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Estée Lauder Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Estée Lauder Companies has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 39% (or a retention ratio of 61%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, Estée Lauder Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 36% of its profits over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is predicted to rise to 58% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Estée Lauder Companies' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

While the stock has lost 8.5% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why PG Could Bounce Back Before LongThe heavy selling of PG shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 26.07. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for PGThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering PG in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.1% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, PG currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Procter &amp; Gamble (PG).P&amp;G currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 58.3% and 16.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PGBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PGCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for P&amp;G here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying P&amp;G, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PG a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for P&amp;G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $5.84.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for P&amp;G may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Georgia Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Georgia would be the 27th biggest economy in the world with a GDP of $692 billion in 2021 which makes it bigger than Poland, Sweden, Belgium and Ireland. The 8th most populous state in the country, Georgia is one of only 15 states with a AAA rating. It is home to many major companies some of which are the biggest companies in the world in their own industries. The state is also home to the busiest airport in the world in Atlanta both in terms of aircraft traffic and passenger traffic in the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport while it is also home to one of the biggest seaports in North America.25 biggest Georgia companies and stocksCopyright: sepavo / 123RF Stock PhotoAtlanta, the capital of Georgia, is one of the most important global cities in the world not just because of having the biggest airport but being home to many major industries which include finance, insurance, technology, real estate manufacturing, logistics and communications. The biggest producer of pecans in the world, Georgia is home to a major agricultural industry and is among the biggest blueberry producers in the country too.In the last one year, Georgia has seen its unemployment rate decline by 0.3%, from 3.3% in November 2021 to 3% in November 2022 which is the 14th best rate for any state. However, even this is not as good as the 2.8% that the state reached for three straight months but with a recession imminent, a slight increase shouldn't be seen as something outlier. Before the pandemic struck, Georgia's unemployment rate was at a historic low of 3.1% before climbing to 12.6% in just two months when the effect of the pandemic was fully felt. Clawing this back to 3% shows the progress the state has made in recovering from the pandemic which should help it navigate economic headwinds heading into 2023.Story continuesTo encourage businesses and their growth in Georgia, which includes various tax credits that allow you to reduce tax credits and is considered to be the first state in the Southeast to use single-factor appointment, which means that the corporate tax rate will be calculated only based on sales made inside Georgia. Some of the tax credits provided by the state, which has definitely helped some of the biggest Georgia companies and stocks, ranges from $1,250 to $4,000 per year for 5 years for every new job that the company creates.The 25 biggest Georgia companies and stocks have combined revenues of over $530 billion while the total market cap exceeds $1.2 trillion.

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Leah Brady. Thank you. Ms. Brady, you may begin.Leah Brady: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Jan Sweetnam and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance.

Our conference call tonight will be limited to 60 minutes. and with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don?Donald Wood: Well, thanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. We ended 2022 on a very strong note and reported FFO per share of $1.58 in the quarter and therefore, $6.32 for the full year, ahead of both internal and external consensus expectations and a precursor to the strong guidance that great real estate with class-leading demographics will allow us to forecast. We're more than a year ahead of where we thought we'd be in recovering from the depth of the pandemic in terms of leasing, occupancy and bottom line earnings. We executed a record 497 leases for over 2 million square feet of retail space in 2022, and the comparable deals were done at 6% more rent on a cash basis and 15% more rent on a straight-line basis than the leases that were expiring.Story continuesWe did that while simultaneously increasing our inherent contractual rent bumps to over 2.25% annually overall. And by the way, based on what we see looking forward into 2023, at this point, while I doubt that we'll do 497 leases again. I would expect a higher lease rollover percentage in 2023 as continued strong demand and inflationary pressures are helping negotiations. We leased up the portfolio at 94.5% at year-end compared with 93.6% a year before and still have room to further increase in 2023. Most importantly, that intensified focus we've been talking about over the last year or so, aimed at minimizing that difference between percent leased and percentage occupied, i.e., getting tenants rent paying more quickly. Well, it's working. While our percentage lease continues to grow, up 90 basis points in 2022, our percentage occupied is growing even faster, up 170 basis points in 2022, suggesting some of the quickest times between lease signing and rent paying in our history, a particularly impressive feat during the supply chain struggles of the past two years.So all of these things resulted in 2022 FFO per share of $6.32, 13.5% higher than the year before and right on top of our pre-pandemic record. I know you've heard me say it many times before, but it bears repeating. Demographics matter, especially in times of economic pressure, past cycles have convinced us that families simply have to have money to spend for retail real estate cash flow to grow. 68,000 households with annual average household incomes of $150 to $1,000 sit within 3 miles of federal centers. That's $10.2 billion of family income generated within a 3-mile radius, and more than half of those people have a 4-year college degree or better. I know no other significantly sized retail portfolio that can say that. So it's manifesting itself in a myriad of ways, including a wide variety of tenants who saw their sales exceed the percentage rent threshold in the lease in the fourth quarter.While not a huge absolute number, since we strive for strong fixed rent in our leases, the broad-based percentage rent contribution in the quarter, particularly among our restaurants and soft goods tenants over and above the fixed rent is notable and contributed an additional $0.02 per share compared with last year's fourth quarter and is a continuation of the trend that we've been seeing all year. Now as economic activity falls and higher interest rates affect everything from car loans to mortgage payments to deal underwriting, we would certainly expect to see a slowdown in consumer spending which very well may cause retailer reticence and a slowdown in the period. It hasn't happened so far. Leasing -- that kind of change is pretty obvious.But that's okay. This business remains more solid. And if history is any indication, federals real estate will outperform given that superior demographics, along with a very strong diversification of rent. No one tenant makes up more than 2.8% of our rental stream, and that tenant is TJX. To put a finer point on that, when you think about today's troubled tenants, Bed Bath, Party City, Rite Aid, Tuesday Morning and even Regal Cinemas, of which we have no exposure, all of them combined comprise less than 1% of our 2023 forecasted rental stream. Average in-place base rent at our 9 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Buybuy Baby locations is $15 a full. Rental will be more than replaceable as we navigate through the expected bankruptcy process with. We continue to opportunistically prune the portfolio of non-core and slower-growing assets.And in the fourth quarter and the last few days of the third quarter, we sold three smaller properties, all in Maryland, for proceeds of about $135 million at a combined flat 5% cap rate: one, a legacy residential community from Federal's earliest days; the second a Federal developed residential building on excess land in Towson Maryland; and the third, one of our earliest small retail developments in Rockville Maryland. Those and earlier sale proceeds were reinvested into assets like Kingstown and the shops of Pembroke Gardens, which are generating better going-in yields and add significantly better growth process. The ability to sell non-core assets accretively is just one of the differentiating tools that we have to manage this company through economic cycles.And of course, you only need to look at the $600 million-plus construction and process number on the year-end balance sheet to identify a large source of future income, much of at least not yet reflected in the results. Okay. So that's about it for my prepared remarks this afternoon, so I'd like to leave you with one final thought before turning it over to Dan. The run-up in interest rates will surely pressure everybody's earnings to some extent in the years ahead, as included, beginning in 2023. Dan will go through the expected impact in a few minutes. But keep in mind that Federal has been around since 1962 and has raised its dividend every year since 1967. This business plan doesn't need money to be virtually free to thrive. It's proven that.In terms of 2023, know that significant incremental rent from contracts that are already in place, particularly where demand is strongest at our mixed-use operating properties like Assembly Row, Pike &amp; Rose, Santana Row, Darian and CocoWalk, along with a full year of contributions from '22 acquisitions, will more than cover incremental interest and lead Federal to what we believe will be an all-time record earnings year in 2023 with sector-leading growth. Dan?Construction, House, BuildingPhoto by dillon kydd on UnsplashDaniel Guglielmone: Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.58 for the fourth quarter and $632 for the year were up 7.5% and 13.5%, respectively, versus 2021. For both periods, we're at the top of our previously increased guidance range. Primary drivers of the outperformance: acceleration in occupancy up to 92.8%, a gain of 70 basis points for the quarter and 170 basis points for the year. Other drivers: higher percentage rent, which more than doubled 2022 versus the previous year; and continued strength in consumer traffic at our mixed-use assets, driving marketing revenues higher. This was offset by higher property operating expenses and higher interest expense. Comparable growth, our GAAP-based metric for same-store in the fourth quarter and the full year came in at 5.4% and 7.7%, respectively, strong metrics despite the negative net impact of prior period rents and terms.On a same-store cash basis, we came in at what we believe to be a sector-leading 5.5% for the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Excluding the negative impacts of prior period rents and term fees, cash same-store growth was 7.8% and 10.8% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. For those analysts and investors to keep track, we had $1.1 million term fees for the fourth quarter against a 4Q '21 level of $1.7 million. Prior period rent contributions related to COVID-impacted negotiated yields were $2 million this fourth quarter versus $4 million in the fourth quarter of '21. Please note that in our investor presentation on our website, there are updated slides plus an appendix which provide all of these figures. Don already highlighted continued strength in leasing, but let me point out a few more statistics of note.The 94.5% and 92.8% in leased and occupied metrics represented growth of 90 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, over 2021 and 20 and 70 basis points of sequential growth over the third quarter. We continue to see strength in our small shop leasing, which now stands at 90%, a level not seen since 2017, but still short of our targeted and historical peak levels. The 80 basis points of relative pickup in our SNO spread over the course of 2022 demonstrates our ability to get tenants open and rent paying. More upside to come in 2023 as we target an SNO spread at more typical levels of 100 to 125 basis points long term. I mentioned leasing activity has been strong to start 2023, and our pipeline of deals executed to date in the first quarter and those under executed LOI is in line so far with 2022's strong leasing volumes.Additionally, we remain optimistic so we can continue to drive favorable lease terms in 2023, including both strong lease rollover growth and sector-leading contractual rent forms. A big driver of our growth in 2022 was the continued stabilization of a large portion of our redevelopment and expansion pipeline. We expect that to be the case in 2023 as well. Having placed $800 million of projects into service in 2021 and 2022 at Assembly Row, Pike &amp; Rose and CocoWalk, we saw a $24 million of incremental POI 2022. We expect another roughly $12 million of incremental POI in 2023, just from those 3 projects alone. The balance of our development pipeline now stands at roughly $730 million which will deliver incremental POI starting this year and continue for the next few years but is less than $300 million remaining to spend.Now to the balance sheet, a quick update on our liquidity position. We ended the year with $86 million of cash available and an undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility for a total liquidity in excess of $1.3 billion. Our leverage metrics continue to be strong. Fourth quarter annualized net debt to EBITDA is roughly 6 times. That metric is forecasted to improve over the course of 2023 as development POI comes online and occupancy drives higher. Again, our targeted level is in the mid -- is in the low to mid 5 times range. Fixed charge coverage was 3.7 times for the fourth quarter and 4 times for the full year. Now on to guidance. For 2023, we are introducing FFO guidance of $6.38 to $6.58 per share. This represents 2.5% growth at the midpoint $6.48 and 4% at the high end of the range.Despite the challenging capital markets environment and embedded headwinds, as promised, Federal will grow in 2023. This is driven by a comparable growth forecast of 2% to 4%. This assumes occupancy levels will increase from 92.8% at 12/31, up above 93% and by year-end 2023, although that progression will not be linear throughout the year. Additional contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline will total $15 million to $18 million. For those modeling, let me direct you to our 8-K on Page 16 and 17 where we provide our forecast of stabilized POI and timing by projects. Accretion from our 2022 acquisitions being online for a full year will also contribute. Those $500-plus million 2022 acquisitions are expected to outperform our original underwriting by at least 50 basis points.This will be offset by lower prior period collections with a net 2022 level of $9 million that's expected to fall to a range of $4 million to $6 million in '23. And lower net term fees, we had $9.5 million in 2022 and forecast $5 million to $6 million in 2023, more in line with our historical averages. Despite over 100 basis points of headwinds, our comparable growth forecast is 2% to 4% for 2023. It would be 3% to 5% without the headwinds from prior period rents and term fees. Quarterly FFO cadence. We'll have one quarter being the weakest with sequential growth thereafter. Other assumptions include $175 million to $200 million of spend on redevelopment and expansions at our existing properties; $175 million to $225 million of common equity issued throughout the year, refinancing our $275 million of unsecured notes, which mature in June in the mid-5% range; G&amp;A in the $52 million to $56 million range for the year; and capitalized interest for 2023 is estimated at $20 million to $22 million which includes the continued capitalization of interest at Santana West.Given our change in leasing strategy from a single tenant leasing approach to a multi-tenant building as we build out tenant floors and add tenant amenities. Dispositions completed in '22, contributed roughly $5 million of POI during the year. That POI will not be there in '23. We've assumed a credit reserve, excluding the impact of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond of roughly 75 basis points. With respect to Bed Bath, we are adding another 25 to 60 basis points of reserve depending on the uncertain outcome with respect to this tenant. Please note, in 2023 and moving forward, we have less than 70 basis points of exposure at our Wynnewood location had a natural expiration in January 2023 and has not been on our '23 forecast since mid-last year. As is our custom, this guidance does not reflect any acquisitions or dispositions in 2023, except what has already been announced.We will adjust for those as we go given our opportunistic approach to both. This guidance also does not assume any tenants moving from a cash basis to accrual basis revenue recognition. Please note the expanded disclosure in our 8-K on Page 30 provides a detailed summary of this guidance. And before we go to Q&amp;A, let me take a minute to highlight the strength the outperformance that our signature mixed-use retail assets demonstrated in 2022. The big four of Santana Row, Assembly Row, Pike &amp; Rose and Bethesda Row, took a disproportionate hit during COVID, because of government shutdowns in their respective markets, but they now sit they finished 2022 at 99% leased. Reported retail sales were 15% to 20% higher than the prior year and are back up above pre-COVID levels.Consumer traffic was up 20% versus the prior year and 7% above pre COVID levels. Comparable retail POI at these assets were up 30% versus 2021 and over 6% above pre-COVID levels. Plus, we are forecasting comparable growth in retail POI for 2023 of 6% to 8% if these four assets given continued strength in leasing demand. The retail components of our mixed-use assets are unique and have driven and should continue to drive POI growth materially above that of a typical open-air shopping center, providing an additional point of differentiation between Federal and its peers. Further, our operational mixed-use capabilities in design, construction, leasing, operations are unrivaled and a unique competitive advantage moving forward in the continued evolution of open-air retail, capabilities that are applicable across our entire retail portfolio and a big reason why we expect that sector-leading retail growth for years to come.And with that, operator, you can open up the line for questions.See also 12 NASDAQ Penny Stocks Under 10 Cents and 17 Biggest MLM Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

This is according to the ""Sports Business Journal."" Let's discuss what this means for the tech giant. For that, we want to bring back Dan Ives, Wedbush Managing Director and senior equity analyst.Dan, it's great to see you here. So clearly a huge move for Apple, now being the sponsor of the halftime show. How big of a win do you think it is for the company? Dan, I think you're muted. And we love the Eagles jersey, by the way. Got it?DAN IVES: OK.SEANA SMITH: There we go.DAN IVES: So part of what Cook and Cupertino are focused on, is really on the NFL and live sports. And this is an important part of ultimately what we see Apple doing more and more of over the coming years. I think it's a huge win, and especially in this macro period, Apple doing this further flex the muscles.SEANA SMITH: Dan, when it talks about Apple here going forward, I think lots of questions just about the amount of money that they have spent or are going to spend on the halftime shows over the next several years. When you see that, does that make sense for them, given the fact that there's no guaranteed return on this type of investment?DAN IVES: But Apple, they're tacticians in terms of how they spend. And this is something they don't just do quickly. And if you look at the history, I mean, they have basically made big bets that have been home run successes.And also, I think at this juncture, it's very important that they're investing at a time where some others maybe are pulling back. And I think that's an important time, especially going into more iPhone launches, as well as some other technologies I'd expect them to introduce over the coming months.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: You thought they were going to take a big swing at the Sunday NFL Ticket Package. What happened there? Did they end up making a bid? Did it just get out of the range they wanted to spend? And do you think they'll take another pass at an NBA, NFL type of property?DAN IVES: Yeah. And look, I think they were significant involved in that. I think some reports have talked about it. I just think it got to a point where they're only going to spend a certain amount. Ultimately, they were not going to go to that level. But live sports is the key to streaming. I mean, that is one of the keys for Apple when it comes to the streaming piece.I don't think they're stopping here. I think they're going to go after major sports over the coming years. And you look at that content strategy, I mean, it just further highlights, whether it's streaming in terms of on TV or what we see with Apple music, services under the radar has actually morphed into a pretty massive business.DAVE BRIGGS: How much will live sports mean for this tech battle? We just discussed Apple. You've got Google, who made the big play for Sunday NFL Ticket, $2.5 billion a year, rumored to be per year. And then Amazon, of course, already in with Thursday Tonight Football. Or is it not that important in terms of the overall growth investor story?DAN IVES: I think it's a golden jewel. I mean, in terms of what big tech's focused on with streaming. Live sports is what is ultimately, and that's why the value continues to go up, because it's not just traditional media. And I think big tech, it's going to take significant bets on live sports over the coming year, especially as you look into '23, '24, '25, '26, a lot sort of come up for renewal. And I think streaming is going to be a big part of that over the coming years.SEANA SMITH: Dan, we don't have to ask you who you're rooting for, very clear. Got to ask you about the score. What do you think it's going to be on Sunday?DAN IVES: I see Eagles by 10.SEANA SMITH: OK.DAN IVES: I think ultimately, yeah, I think between Hurts and that defense, I think, I see a lot of happy fans in the 215 area code.SEANA SMITH: I hope you are right. 215 area code is my hometown. Dan Ives, great to see you, thanks so much.DAN IVES: Thank you.]"

Our Josh Schafer, he is our resident junky gambler, and he's going to break it down for us. I need some prop action. So what do you got for me?JOSH SCHAFER: All right, we got some fun ones here for you guys. We're going to start with Gatorade, which sounds like it's a hot topic for you two. And--DAVE BRIGGS: Yep.SEANA SMITH: It is.JOSH SCHAFER: --I'm not going to lie-- where did we pick? Who had red? Someone had red, right?DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, I took red, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: All right, you're with 8% of the handle here. That's plus 450 odds, Dave. So what you're looking at is where people are betting. So the most bet on Gatorade is yellow. 40% of the money is on yellow. And then you've got 20% of the money on blue, 20% of the money on orange.SEANA SMITH: That's my pick.JOSH SCHAFER: My pick-- I got to step out of the way here-- is purple because I think Riptide Rush is the best Gatorade. And that's simply all I'm picking off of. There is some fun stats if you guys want to go deep into this, right? Orange is the most picked. That's probably why Seana picked it. It's come up the most times since 2001.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I did my research.JOSH SCHAFER: And then yellow is also very popular right now among Eagles fans. So yellow was poured on Doug Pederson at the NFC Championship and the Super Bowl the last time the Eagles won. And Nick Sirianni, two weeks ago, had yellow Gatorade poured on him.DAVE BRIGGS: Oh!SEANA SMITH: I love that flavor.JOSH SCHAFER: You really like yellow.DAVE BRIGGS: That's a solid scoop. There are some of these colors, Josh, that are a little bit in between that there's like a greenish blue. You know what I mean, the greenish blue--JOSH SCHAFER: Greenish blue.DAVE BRIGGS: --Gatorade.Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: Well, we got yellow green. I don't know.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm looking at it, Frost.JOSH SCHAFER: You're going to have to call back up Jason Robbins, I think, on Monday--SEANA SMITH: You're going to be the one that's disputing the color of Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: --and dispute what color you had because yellow green is the only unclear one here. You got red pink.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, that would be pretty clear.DAVE BRIGGS: But, like, pink? Is that even a Gatorade?SEANA SMITH: That's going to be a tough one to argue with.JOSH SCHAFER: That's why I'm going with purple. It's simple. I don't know if it's ever going to happen.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange.JOSH SCHAFER: But I'm going purple.DAVE BRIGGS: OK, all right, that's a good job.]"

(NASDAQ:PEP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-pepsico-inc-140017553.html,1676037617,STORY,['PEP'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.15bUS$10.2bUS$10.6bUS$11.3bUS$12.2bUS$12.7bUS$13.2bUS$13.7bUS$14.1bUS$14.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.67%Est @ 3.89%Est @ 3.34%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$8.6kUS$9.0kUS$8.7kUS$8.7kUS$8.7kUS$8.6kUS$8.3kUS$8.1kUS$7.8kUS$7.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$84bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$310bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$310b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$160bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$244b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$173, the company appears about fair value at a 1.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PepsiCo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PepsiCoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next .Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Better yet, the volatility largely centers on developments of the industry itself rather than the broader economy. By that, I mean biotechnology firms may enjoy some economic insulation as their relevance supersedes variables like interest rate dynamics.Still, it doesn’t mean that the best biotech stocks to buy are immune from broader economic pressures. As well, with mass layoffs collectively impacting what white-collar workers can spend on their portfolios, investors should exercise careful judgment.For that, I’ve compiled some of the most compelling ideas in the biotech space. Each of these ideas feature a minimum consensus rating of moderate buy or its equivalent. As well, they’re undervalued relative to trailing earnings.

Headquartered in Westchester County, New York, Regeneron invents, develops, and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases. It’s also a strong performer. In the trailing year, REGN gained over 25% of equity value.Primarily, retail investors consider Regeneron as one of the best biotech stocks to buy for its value proposition. Currently, the market prices REGN at a forward multiple of 18.79. As a discount to forward earnings, Regeneron ranks better than 66.13% of the competition. As well, the company enjoys excellent sales growth (47.3% over the past three years) and profitability (39.17% net margin).Story continuesNot surprisingly, Wall Street analysts peg REGN as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $834.94, implying upside potential of 6.94%. Finally, hedge funds love REGN, with TipRanks rating sentiment among these institutional investors as very positive. Therefore, REGN is one of the best biotech stocks to buy.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comBased in Boston, Massachusetts, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) claims it invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. Like Regeneron above, Vertex represents a strong performer. In the year so far, VRTX gained almost 7% of equity value. During the trailing year, VRTX soared over 25%.As well, retail investors appreciate the value proposition that Vertex brings to the table. Presently, the market prices VRTX at a forward multiple of 19.12. As a discount to forward earnings, Vertex ranks better than 64.52% of sector rivals. In addition, the company enjoys a strong sales growth rate (35.3% in the past three years) and profitability (37.62% net margin).Also, it’s worth noting that Vertex enjoys a stout balance sheet. Specifically, its Altman Z-Score pings at 15.11, reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg VRTX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $333.73, implying upside potential of 9.47%. Therefore, it makes a compelling case for best biotech stocks to buy this month.Harmony Biosciences (HRMY)an image of a microscopeSource: ShutterstockA relatively lesser-known enterprise, Harmony Biosciences (NASDAQ:HRMY) nevertheless deserves consideration for best biotech stocks to buy. According to its website, the company specializes in developing and delivering new treatments to help people living with rare neurological diseases. As with the top two names, HRMY represents a strong performer in the charts. In the trailing year, shares gained over 30% of equity value.That said, since the Jan. opener, HRMY slipped more than 6%. However, this stumbling could inspire contrarians to jump onboard. Currently, the market prices HRMY at a trailing multiple of 19.36. As a discount to earnings, Harmony ranks better than 65% of its peers. Also, HRMY trades at 19.4-times operating cash flow. As a discount to the underlying metric, Harmony ranks superior to 62.5% of its peers.Notably, Harmony enjoys a decently stable balance sheet. In addition, it’s highly profitable with a net margin of 38.84%. Wall Street analysts really dig HRMY, pegging it a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $68.25, implying nearly 38% upside potential. Easily, Harmony ranks among the best biotech stocks to buy in February.Genfit (GNFT)MNMD stock: A scientist holding a test tube in a stock imageSource: ShutterstockStepping toward the higher-risk names among the best biotech stocks to buy, we come to France’s Genfit (NASDAQ:GNFT). A late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of innovative therapeutic and diagnostic solutions in metabolic and liver-related diseases, Genfit aims to serve considerable unmet medical needs. Despite the clinical risks associated with this subsegment, GNFT is a respectable performer, gaining 13.5% in the trailing year.Currently, the market prices GNFT at a trailing multiple of 4.68. As a discount to earnings, Genfit ranks better than 89.16% of its peers. Further, GNFT trades at 2.83-times sales, which is very undervalued relative to the industry median. However, Gurufocus.com warns that Genfit may be a possible value trap.It’s a tough call because its incredible growth rate (nearly 800% in the past three years) won’t last. As such, there might be questions about its profitability metrics. However, H.C. Wainwright analyst Ed Arce is willing to support Genfit, pegging GNFT as a buy. As well, Arce anticipates shares will rise to $8 a pop. That would imply upside potential of over 79%, making GNFT one of the best biotech stocks to buy.iTeos Therapeutics (ITOS)An image of a tablet with 'therapeutics' on the screen, a stethoscope and face mask around itSource: ra2 studio/ShutterstockA cancer-fighting specialist, iTeos Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ITOS) is pioneering the discovery and development of highly differentiated Immuno-oncology therapeutics for patients. Representing one of the riskier names among the best biotech stocks to buy, prospective investors must be careful. True, ITOS gained nearly 10% since the Jan. opener, a respectable performance. However, in the trailing year, shares collapsed to the tune of about 44%.Now, despite that obvious challenge, ITOS may still command contrarian interest. Presently, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 2.96. Under the context of a running discount against earnings, iTeos ranks better than 93.36% of the competition. Further, the market prices ITOS at 1.71-times sales, comparing favorably to the sector median of 10.61 times.At the moment, iTeos enjoys a robust balance sheet (with a cash-to-debt ratio of over 167 times) and strong profitability (with net margin of 57.48%). Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ITOS as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $54, implying 165% upside potential. If it gets there, ITOS would easily represent one of the best biotech stocks to buy.Selecta Biosciences (SELB)OLK Stock. Modern Medical Research Laboratory: Two Scientists Wearing Face Masks use Microscope, Analyse Sample in Petri Dish, Talk. Advanced Scientific Lab for Medicine, Biotechnology. Blue Color. KZR stock. RSLS stockSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comAnother risky but simultaneously compelling name among the best biotech stocks to buy, Selecta Biosciences (NASDAQ:SELB) aims to restore natural immune system balance by re-imagining immunotherapy for autoimmune disease. Ultimately, it hopes to unlock the potential of gene therapy and amplify the efficacy of biologic therapy.Despite its scientific potential, SELB rates as a volatile investment. In the trailing year, shares slipped nearly 20%. However, since the January opener, SELB gained over 59% of equity value, making it an intriguing prospect for gamblers.In terms of the financials, the market prices SELB at a trailing multiple of 15.25. Stated as a discount to earnings, Selecta ranks above 70.98% of sector peers. As well, SELB trades at 1.96-times sales, which as a discount ranks better than 88.13% of the industry.Interestingly, despite the sharp risks involved with Selecta, Wall Street analysts peg SELB as a consensus strong buy. Even better, their average price target of $6.80 implies upside potential of almost 272%.Chimerix (CMRX)Illustrative Editorial of Chimerix Inc website homepage. Chimerix Inc logo visible on display screen. CMRX stockSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the riskiest name on this list of biotech stocks to buy, Chimerix (NASDAQ:CMRX) belongs to the gamblers. If you want something a bit more reliable, the top names should take priority. However, Chimerix delivers potentially blistering upside potential. Specializing in a new class of cancer therapies, CMRX may skyrocket depending on clinical trial results.So far, circumstances don’t bode well. In the trailing year, CMRX fell almost 69%, a staggering loss. At the same time, since late September last year, CMRX stabilized. Currently, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 1.05. As a discount to earnings, Chimerix ranks better than 97.2% of the competition. Still, as Gurufocus.com warns, CMRX may be a possible value trap.Admittedly, it’s going to be difficult to hold Chimerix shares, not really knowing where the wind might blow. Still, Wall Street analysts remain confident, pegging CMRX as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $8, implying upside potential of over 337%. If so, CMRX would easily rank tops among the best biotech stocks to buy this month.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

For more top stocks, head on over to Bank of America's 5 Stock Picks for 2023. 2023 is turning out to be an interesting year for the stock market. After major technology and growth firms suffered massive losses on the market last year, within a month they have registered surprising gains that have questioned the pessimistic sentiment emanating from several quarters. For instance, while Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares were among the worst performers of 2022, year to date, the stock has appreciated by a massive 86%. Yet, Tesla isn't the only company making waves on the market. Two others, namely Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) lost more than half of their market capitalization last year. But lo and behold, as we settle into 2023, the duo's shares are up by 47% and 51%, respectively. Quite a turnaround if you ask us, but still a long way to go to retake previous heights.For the market as a whole, there are two key questions - both tightly related - that are on everyone's minds. 2022 was marked by the Federal Reserve's all out approach to battle inflation. This fight, fueled by rising interest rates, generates worries that the economy might head into a recession. So a debate on recession and interest rates continues to rage, and even investment banks have picked their sides. For instance, while The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that a recession can be avoided, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is of the opinion that it is possible one will strike the economy later this year. Another optimist among us is President Joe Biden, who in a fresh interview given to PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff, shared that not only does he not see a recession this year, but next year as well. President Biden simply responded to a question asking his thoughts on a recession this year by stating:No. Or next year. From the moment I got elected, how many of the experts are saying within the next six months is going to be recession?Story continuesHowever, analysts at the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) would like to disagree with the President. Not only do they believe that a recession is highly likely this year, but their strategy to deal with the uncertain economic outlook entails investing in bonds for the first half of this year and then switching to equities later on. The financial firm's sentiment on recession is as follows:A recession is all but inevitable in the U.S., Euro Area and UK: Expect a mild U.S. recession in the first half of 2023 with a risk that it starts later. Europe likely sees recession this winter [2022] with a shallow recovery thereafter as real incomes and likely overtightening pressure demand.Yet, since it's a sell side firm, Bank of America still has its favorite pick of stocks, and out of these, some of the best performing ones in 2023 so far are Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC).Bank of America's 15 Stock Picks for 2023Copyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We scoured the Internet to find out which stocks are Bank Of America's favorite picks for 2023.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Minnesota Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Minnesota would be the 53rd biggest economy in the world with a GDP of $412 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This means that the state's GDP is bigger than Egypt, Denmark and Singapore. 27 companies headquartered in Minnesota are in the Fortune 500. Currently, Minnesota is a major contributor to agriculture in the U.S. and is the country's biggest producer of green peas, sweet corn and sugar beets and is home to major food processing companies which then turn crops into the finished product.While Minnesota's economy has evolved, some industries which have dominated the last couple of centuries are still important contributors to the economy of the the state such as forestry. Further, even though iron ores are mostly depleted in a state which produced a large portion of total iron production in the world, taconite mining is still an important contributor to Minnesota's economy. Retail is another industry which has maintained a strong presence and some of the most popular retail chains in addition to being among the biggest retailers in the country, with thousands of locations maintained across the country.25 biggest Minnesota companies and stocksPixabay/Public DomainIn June 2022, Minnesota's unemployment rate was just 1.8%, among the best in the country but it has declined in the last six months and in November 2022, unemployment in the state increased to 2.3%, though it is still the second lowest unemployment rate in the country right now, with only Utah outperforming Minnesota in this measure. Despite the slight increase in the past 6 months, there shouldn't really be a major cause for concern since the unemployment rate has been historically low and is still well below the average. Whether this continues in 2023 amid a recession still remains to be seen. According to DEED commissioner Steve Grove stated that Minnesota's economy has grown much faster than most other states in 2022 and has seen fourteen straight months of jobs growth while its labor participation rate being 67.9% in November.Story continuesTo attract businesses to the state, Minnesota provides various incentives, grants and tax credits which could change the composition of the biggest Minnesota companies and stocks in the future. The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development provides various such incentives including angel tax credit schemes, Urban Initiative Loan Program, Minnesota Job Creation Funding, Small Business Administration Financing Programs, Indian Business Loan Program and State Small Business Credit Initiative. The state also provides matching grants of up to $50,000 to support manufacturers in the state while private companies with $1 million to $50 million in revenue can receive customized information and guidance that will help the company grow.The 25 biggest Minnesota companies and stocks includes some incredibly well-known companies with the number one company being among the biggest companies in the U.S. by revenue. Their combined revenue is around $713 billion while their combined market cap is over $968 billion.

We then calculated their market cap from Yahoo Finance and assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. Where a company wasn't publicly linked, the company's rank was based on revenue.
