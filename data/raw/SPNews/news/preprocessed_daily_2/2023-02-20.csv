Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Although, when we looked at Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Acuity Brands, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$513m ÷ (US$3.4b - US$698m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2022).Thus, Acuity Brands has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Electrical industry average of 10% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Acuity Brands roceIn the above chart we have measured Acuity Brands' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Acuity Brands.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOver the past five years, Acuity Brands' ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Acuity Brands to be a multi-bagger going forward.The Key TakeawayWe can conclude that in regards to Acuity Brands' returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 35% to shareholders over the last five years. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Story continuesOn a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Acuity Brands   you'll probably want to know about.While Acuity Brands isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

3,901ddfd6-fe56-3c61-95b4-897c641127f8,STT,2023-02-20,Bet on These 5 Low-Leverage Stocks Amid Persistent Inflation,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-5-low-leverage-stocks-115911124.html,1676894351,STORY,"['ALK', 'STT']","[U.S. stocks ended on a mixed note on Feb 17, following Federal Reserve officials’ comments on renewed fears about interest rates. Persistent inflation also continued to be a major concern for investors.However, this should not dissuade investors from putting their money in the stock market. In fact, a prudent investor knows that this is the right time to buy stocks that are safe bets.  To this end, we recommend stocks like Rollins ROL, Alaska Air Group ALK, Linde LIN, Skyline SKY and State Street STT, which bear low leverage and, therefore, can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor, if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are, hence, less risky.To identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityStory continuesThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the fourth-quarter earnings cycle going on full-fledged, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks with a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present five out of 13 picks that made it through screening.Rollins: It provides pest and termite control services to residential and commercial customers. The company offers protection against termite damage, insects and rodents to homes and businesses, including food manufacturers, food service establishments, hotels, transportation companies and retailers.

5,19a658e6-d94a-3cdd-b6c6-580bbd47adcb,CF,2023-02-20,"Time To Worry? Analysts Are Downgrading Their CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) Outlook",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-worry-analysts-downgrading-cf-101155427.html,1676887915,STORY,['CF'],"[The analysts covering CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) delivered a dose of negativity to shareholders today, by making a substantial revision to their statutory forecasts for this year. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts were both revised downwards, with the analysts seeing grey clouds on the horizon.Following the latest downgrade, the current consensus, from the 15 analysts covering CF Industries Holdings, is for revenues of US$8.0b in 2023, which would reflect a stressful 29% reduction in CF Industries Holdings' sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to nosedive 32% to US$11.64 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$9.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$14.61 in 2023. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about CF Industries Holdings' prospects, administering a substantial drop in revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot. View our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings earnings-and-revenue-growthAnalysts made no major changes to their price target of US$106, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on CF Industries Holdings' valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values CF Industries Holdings at US$132 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$75.00. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 29% by the end of 2023. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 21% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 3.4% per year. It's pretty clear that CF Industries Holdings' revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for CF Industries Holdings. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. We're also surprised to see that the price target went unchanged. Still, deteriorating business conditions (assuming accurate forecasts!) can be a leading indicator for the stock price, so we wouldn't blame investors for being more cautious on CF Industries Holdings after the downgrade.With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple CF Industries Holdings analysts - going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.Of course, seeing company management  invest large sums of money in a stock can be just as useful as knowing whether analysts are downgrading their estimates.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read the 5 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023.When things get rough for Wall Street, many smart investors turn towards safe dividend stocks. Such companies, known to have experience in navigating market downturns, pay regular dividends. A market report provided by ProShares stated that the S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18%, while the Russell 2000 Index fell by more than 20% this past year. On the other hand, dividend stocks remained much more favorable and rewarded investors with strong, stable returns, outperforming both non-dividend stocks and bonds.Additionally, Hartford Funds states that dividends have played a significant role in the returns investors have received during the past half century, as 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index can be attributed to reinvested dividends since 1960, while the contribution of dividend incomes to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index averaged 40% till 2021.Companies with long histories of annual dividend growth are known to have positive performance over time. When a firm manages to raise its dividend year after year, through recession, war, market crashes and more, it's making a powerful statement about both its financial resilience and its commitment to shareholders. In that regard, companies that have consistently raised their dividends, including AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson, and Company (NYSE:BDX), can provide investors some peace of mind.15 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023Our MethodologyWe scoured the lists of Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings stocks and picked the ones that have the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital held the largest stake in the company, with 9.5 million shares worth $382.6 million.13. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 9.75%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an energy company that specializes in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. A notable Dividend Aristocrat, the company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share for a dividend yield of 9.75%, as of February 14.Earlier this January, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar assumed coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with a Buy rating with a price target of $82, down from $86. Although the analyst admits that the stock is trading at a slight premium to its large-cap peers, he believes that the company's ""fixed plus variable"" dividend is both ""sustainable and differentiated, which merits the premium valuation.""According to hedge fund sentiment, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is one of the safest dividend stocks to invest in. In the third quarter of 2022, 51 hedge funds were long Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 10.6 million shares worth $642 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHeaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”12. Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.50%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), also known simply as BD, is an American multinational medical technology company that manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has paid uninterrupted dividends on its common stock since 1895 and has increased payments to common shareholders every year for 60 years.On January 30, Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian upgraded Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to Overweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $82. The top household products pick at Morgan Stanley on account of its robust pricing power, strong pet trends and positive corporate strategy changes, Mohsenian states that the near 10% pullback in shares over the last month offers a buying opportunity ""into a structurally attractive name."" Additionally, he believes that the company's conservative 2023 earnings guidance should allow it to beat lowered consensus forecasts.According to our Q3 2022 data, 57 of the 920 hedge funds surveyed by Insider Monkey had invested in the company. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)’s largest investor.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 2.90%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company also manufactures, sells, and markets other non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. The beverage company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 61 years. It currently offers a per-share dividend of $0.46 every quarter with a dividend yield of 2.90%, as of February 14.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 from $68 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the company's ""robust"" 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company's 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was the leading stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q3 2022. Overall, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned investments in the company in Q3, worth over $25 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 4.75%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is an American alternative investment management company based in New York City whose private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyouts in the last three decades. Blackstone, Inc. (NYSE:BX) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.91 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.75%, as recorded on February 14.On January 27, BMO Capital analyst Rufus Hone raised the price target on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) to $92 from $85 but maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited the company's Q4 earnings beat and noted that Blackstone is incrementally positive around the outlook for Retail inflows recovering, and should benefit from any ""soft landing"" economic outcome.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds were bullish on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assets We recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team. Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”7. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois, United States. The company is known for its diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition products, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Among Abbott's most well-known brands are Pedialyte, Ensure, Similac, and Glucerna.On January 26, Stifel analyst Rick Wise raised his price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares, telling investors that the company's management had ""an encouragingly positive tone to start 2023"" on its earnings call. He adds that, with Abbott starting off with high-single-digit organic sales growth guidance and $4.30-$4.50 EPS guidance that ""basically brackets current consensus,"" the 2023 setup ""also appears encouraging.""Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.92%, as of February 14. The company has a run of 51 years of consistent dividend growth.At the end of September, 62 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), up from 61 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $3 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas.On February 15, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised the price target on Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023.  Suggested articles:15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This MonthDisclosure.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)On the economic data side, all eyes will be on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's most closely watched assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — which is set for release Friday morning.Prices in January likely jumped 0.5% over the prior month as measured by the PCE index, according to data from Bloomberg. in December PCE inflation rose just 0.1% month-on-month. On an annual basis, PCE inflation is projected to come in at 5% in January, no improvement from the year-over-year figure reported at the end of 2022.Core PCE, which removes the volatile food and energy components out, is set to show a 0.4% climb over the prior month — ticking up slightly from 0.3% in December — and a marginally slower rise of 4.3% over the year, down from 4.4% in the last month of 2022.If realized, those numbers would support recent indications inflation is not falling at the pace and extent investors have been hoping for, even as prices have stabilized from the peaks of the current cycle.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) out last week showed inflation picked up in January, while cooling only slightly over the year to 6.4%.

REUTERS/Amanda Andrade-RhoadesThis view has thwarted the market's recent momentum.On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its third-straight losing week for the first time since September, closing down 0.1% for the five-day trading period.Story continuesThe S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, its second consecutive week in the red, while the Nasdaq was an outlier, notching a weekly gain of 0.6%.The bumpier-than-anticipated road to restoring price stability and strong economic data to start the year — nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 in January while retail sales surged 3% — have prompted Wall Street banks to revise their expectations for upcoming rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.Teams at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America said this week they estimate three more rate increases this year; ahead of February's interest rate increase, some market participants had seen that move potentially marking the end of the Fed's rate hiking cycle.Economists at Goldman Sachs and BofA each added additional 25-basis-point rate hikes in June to their forecasts, bringing both banks' projected estimates for the peak of the federal funds rate in this cycle to a new range of 5.25%-5.5%.Bank of America also indicated evidence is strong for a potential 0.50% increase at the Federal Reserve's next meeting in March.""In our view, several forces would have to come together to cause the Fed to revert to a larger 50-basis-point rate hike,"" a team of strategists led by Michael Gapen said in a Friday note.Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) meeting Jan. 31-Feb. 1 out Wednesday afternoon will offer insight into the thinking behind officials' 25-basis-point increase earlier in the month.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in a speech Thursday she would have favored raising interest rates by 0.50%, asserting that she and her colleagues have further work to do in taming inflation.""The FOMC has come an appreciable way in bringing policy from a very accommodative stance to a restrictive one, but I believe we have more work to do,"" Mester said at a Global Interdependence Center conference at the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee College of Business.""I don’t want to surprise the markets,"" Mester said. ""We're better if we explain. In that meeting there was an economic case for [a 50 basis point increase] in my view, but the market wasn't expecting that.

10,63c5b089-a42e-3d30-9180-7da167fa4f9a,MET,2023-02-20,10 Best Annuity Companies In the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-annuity-companies-us-200936920.html,1676837376,STORY,"['MET-PE', 'UNH', 'MKL']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best annuity companies in the US. To skip our detailed analysis of annuities and the insurance sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Annuity Companies in the US.Within the world of insurance companies, annuities are a more specialized concept. These are contracts between clients and insurance companies that require the insurer to make payments to the customer immediately or in the future. An annuity can be bought either by making a single payment or by making a series of payments spread out over a few years. There are four main types of annuities: immediate, deferred, fixed, and variable. Annuity companies' customers can thus pick their preferred type of annuity depending on when they want to start receiving their annuity payments and how they would like for their annuity to be invested.  As of November 2022, AM Best, a top credit rating agency, maintains a Stable outlook for the US life/annuity segment. This signifies the strength and resilience of annuity companies in the US over the past year, showing why they are in focus today.For most people, their interaction with the concept of insurance begins with traditional insurance companies such as Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL). Annuity companies are also part of the insurance industry and have been benefitting over the past couple of years due to a range of factors. According to AM Best's market segment report on the annuity segment, published in November 2022, these include cost savings and a pandemic-driven acceleration in product and systems modernization. The Stable outlook for the annuities segment is helped by annuity companies' solid capital management and record sales growth. Even though the annuities segment saw earnings volatility in 2022, capital markets gains and diversified earnings enabled the segment to offset the mortality impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Story continuesOn sales growth, the report noted that annuity sales have managed to steadily rise in 2022. In the second quarter, they increased by 22% to $77.5 billion. This was the highest quarterly sales figure recorded for the annuities segment and was made possible by ongoing equity market declines and rising interest rates. For fixed-rate, deferred annuities, sales growth was recorded at 76%, while for fixed-index annuities, sales growth was recorded at 19%, in comparison with the second quarter of 2021. Even generally, the insurance industry benefitted from a renewed interest in life insurance in 2022. New life insurance annualized premiums increased by 17% in the first quarter of 2022, making this quarter the fifth-consecutive quarter of double-digit premium growth for life insurance. As such, annuity companies are expected to continue their upwards trend in 2023, with higher sales growth than ever before.Best Annuity Companies In the USSource:unsplashLet's now take a look at the 10 best annuity companies in the US.Our MethodologyTo create our list of the best annuity companies below, we have relied on two metrics: AM Best's ratings demonstrating the financial strength of these companies and the fixed annuity rates offered by them as of January 2023. AM Best's rating system includes categories going down from A++ to F, and these ratings primarily indicate the financial stability of the company concerned. All the companies mentioned below have ratings of B+ (Good) and above, going up to A (Excellent). These companies are also offering fixed annuity rates of over 4% for their various products, spread over different time durations, from three to 10 years. The companies are ranked based on their AM Best ratings, from the lowest to the highest.Best Annuity Companies In the US10.

(NYSE:OMC) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.70 per share on the 6th of April. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 3.0%, which is around the industry average. See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Omnicom Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, Omnicom Group's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 30.4% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 35% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendOmnicom Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.20 total annually to $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.8% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Omnicom Group Could Grow Its DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Omnicom Group has grown earnings per share at 6.8% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.Omnicom Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Omnicom Group might even raise payments in the future. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

And welcome to the Marathon Oil Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. . Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Guy Baber, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Guy Baber: Thank you, Anita. And thank you as well to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. Yesterday after the close, we issued a press release, a slide presentation and investor packet that addressed our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, as well as our 2023 outlook. These documents can be found on our website @marathonoil.com. Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dane Whitehead, our Executive VP and CFO; Pat Wagner, our Executive VP of Corporate Development and Strategy; and Mike Henderson, our Executive VP of Operations. As a reminder, today's call will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.As always I will refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials, as well as to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. We will also reference certain non-GAAP terms in today's discussion, which have been reconciled and defined in our earnings materials. With that, I will turn the call over to Lee and the rest of the team, who will provide prepared remarks. After the completion of these remarks, we will move to question-and-answer session. Lee?Lee Tillman: Thank you, Guy, and good morning to everyone listening to our call today. First, I want to thank our employees and contractors for their collective contributions to another remarkable year. A year that can only be described as comprehensive delivery against all dimensions of our well established framework for success. Your dedication and hard work, as well as your steadfast commitment to our core values, including safety and environmental excellence that made it possible -- that made possible the exceptional results I get to talk about today. So thank you. 2022 truly was an exceptional year. But our outlook for 2023 and beyond is equally compelling. While the team and I will cover a lot of ground today I'll start by highlighting a few key things.Story continuesFirst, we're successfully executing on the more S&amp;P less E&amp;P mandate our champions for the last two years. They are delivering financial and operational outcomes not just at the top of our high performing E&amp;P peer group, but at the very top of the S&amp;P 500. The results in 2022 really do speak for themselves. $4 billion of adjusted free cash flow generation, the strongest free cash flow yield in our peer group, and one of the top five free cash flow yields in the entire S&amp;P 500. The lowest reinvestment rate in our peer group a full 10 percentage points below the S&amp;P 500 average. And one of the lowest capital intensities, all indicators of a now well established capital and operating efficiency advantage relative to a high performing peer group.Second, we're returning significant capital back to our shareholders through our cash flow driven return of capital framework. Our framework is transparent, it's differentiated, it prioritizes our investors as the first call on capital, and it uniquely protect shareholder distributions from capital inflation. During 2022, we've returned 55% of our adjusted free cash flow from operations or $3 billion to shareholders. And for those keeping score relative to the free cash flow based models of our peers, that equates to about 75% of free cash flow. That also translates to a 17% shareholder distribution yield, the highest distribution yield on our E&amp;P peer space, and one of the top 10 distribution deals in the entire S&amp;P 500. We've remained steadfast in our commitment to the powerful combination of a competitive and sustainable base dividend.In addition to consistent share repurchases. That consistency paid off with $2.8 billion of accretive share repurchases that reduced our share count by 15%, driving significant growth on a per share basis. Rewinding all the way back to the start of this most recent share repurchase program in October of 2021, we have reduced our share count by 20%. Again, leading the peer group. And we raised our base dividend three times during 2022, bringing our track record to seven increases in the last eight quarters. Third, we successfully closed on the Ensign acquisition before year end. Materially strengthening our portfolio and enhancing our Eagle Ford scale. The Ensign acquisition makes us a stronger company. Checking every box of our disciplined acquisition criteria.It's a accretive to key financial metrics, it's accretive to our return of capital framework, it's accretive to our high quality inventory life and it offers compelling industrial logic in the core of a basin we know well. Pat will provide additional details later in the call but ensure integration efforts are progressing well and initial 2023 results have outperformed our expectations. Finally, while 2022 was certainly a banner year, I'm just as excited about our potential in 2023 and beyond. Fully consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework, our 2023 budget prioritizes significant free cash flow generation and return of capital to shareholders. At reference commodity prices of $80 WTI $3 Henry Hub and $20 TTF we expect to generate $2.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow and we expect to return a minimum of $1.8 billion to our shareholders, providing clear visibility to a double digit shareholder distribution yield.And recognizing the ongoing volatility in commodity prices, particularly natural gas it is important to note that a $0.50 per MMBtu change in Henry Hub only impacts our annual cash flow by just over $100 million. While dollar change in WTI moves cash flow by about $70 million, reflecting continued leverage to oil pricing at our balanced portfolio. Once again, we fully expect to lead our peer group and the broader S&amp;P 500 when it comes to the financial and operational metrics that matter most. Free cash flow generation, capital and operating efficiency and shareholder distributions. While our 2023 outlook is compelling, we're even better positioned for 2024 as our unique integrated gas business in Equatorial Guinea will benefit from an increase to global LNG price exposure.Just as a reminder, the current Henry Hub index contract for our equity Alba gas through ET LNG expires at the end of 2023. And we will move to a market base global LNG linkage. With the current and significant arbitrage between Henry Hub and global LNG prices, we expect this to translate into an uplift to 2024 EBITDA of $500 million to potentially more than $1 billion relative to 2023. With that, I'll turn it over to Dane, who'll provide more detail around our return of capital performance and outlook. Dane?Dane Whitehead: Thank you, Lee. Good morning, all. Lee (ph) capital high points, but giving you importance of the topic, I'll further elaborate on our framework, our execution and our outlook. As we've stated before, returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders, through this cycle, remains foundational to our value proposition in the marketplace. And when it comes to shareholder distributions, track record matters. We're building a track record we're really proud of and that investors can trust. During 2022 we've returned 55% of our CFO to shareholders, significantly exceeding our 40% of CFO framework commitment. Total shareholder distributions amounted to $3 billion, good for a total shareholder distribution yield of 17%.That's the highest in our peer space and one of the top distribution yields in the S&amp;P 500. That includes $2.8 billion of accretive share repurchases during the year. We continue to believe that buying back our stock is an excellent use of capital due to the value we see with our shares, trading at a free cash flow yield in the upper teens. Repurchases are value accretive, a very efficient means to drive per share growth and are synergistic to grow in our base dividends. During 2022, we reduced our share count by 15%. And since reinitiating our share repurchase program in October 2021, we've reduced our share count by more than 20%, by far, the most significant share count reduction in our peer space as shown on the bottom right graphic on Slide seven.Oil and gas, Industry, EnergyPhoto by Dean Brierley on UnsplashAnother benefit of our buyback program, is the capacity it creates for ongoing growth in our per share base dividend. We recently raised our quarterly base dividend by 11% to $0.10 per share. The seventh increase in the trailing eight quarters. While its most recent increases more than fully funded by incremental cash flow from the Ensign acquisition, ongoing share count reductions from our buyback program create clear potential for further base dividend increases in the future. Our operating cash flow driven framework is differentiated and it protects distributions from the effects of capital inflation, offsetting inflation is on us. We believe this makes for a stronger commitment to our investors, as our investors will truly get the first call on cash flow.For 2023, the recently completed Ensign acquisition makes our framework even more shareholder friendly adding close to 20% to our pre-acquisition operating cash flow, and therefore adding 20% to our shareholder distribution capacity. In addition, with the 2022 financial -- actual financial results in hand, along with the December close at Ensign, we anticipate will be able to defer U.S. cash alternative minimum taxes to 2024. Our objective for 2023 is to firmly adhere to our return to capital framework, continuing to return at least 40% of CFO while also paying including some of the Ensign related acquisition financing. We believe we can do both, maintaining our return of capital leadership in this peer space, which is the top priority, and continue to enhance our already investment grade balance sheet through gross debt reduction, all supported by our financial strength and flexibility.On the balance sheet, we have about $200 million of high coupon U.S.X debt maturing and replaced. We plan to pay that off with cash on hand to reduce gross debt and interest expense. We also have $200 million of low cost tax exempt bonds maturing in 2023. These tax exempt bonds are unique and very flexible component of our capital structure. We plan to leverage the cost advantage or tax exempt credit capacity to refinance those bonds in 2023. And we have the optionality to do the same with future tax exempt maturities in 2024 and 2026. With regard to shareholder returns, our 40% return on capital commitment in 2023 provides visibility to $1.8 billion of minimum shareholder distributions at our reference price deck as a double digit return of capital yield, one of the highest in our peer space.We have been executing share repurchases so far in Q1 23. And plan to continue to do so consistent with our framework. And we have ample capacity in our current Board authorization to keep moving. While 40% represents a good starting point for your models, our track record has been to exceed that minimum return, and we'll look to keep that track record intact in 2023. Especially if we benefit from any commodity price support over the balance of the year, which would significantly enhance both shareholder returns and debt reduction. They have tremendous leverage to commodity price improvement. And we'll use that to the benefit of our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Pat, who'll briefly walk us through an update on the Ensign acquisition.Pat Wagner: Thanks, Dane. Consistent with our market commitment, we successfully closed on the Ensign acquisition before the end of the year. As we've stated, this transaction checks all the boxes of our M&amp;A framework, immediate financial accretion, return of capital appreciation consistent with Dane comments, accretion to inventory life and quality and industrial logic with enhanced scale, all on maintaining our financial strength and investment grade balance sheet. And we based our Ensign valuation on a one rig maintenance program with no credit for potential upside associated with redevelopment refrac. Our focus now is on integration and execution. In terms of integration, early efforts have gone exceptionally well. We had originally planned for major elements of the transition to take up to four months post close, we not expect to be substantially complete with operations transition activities by the end of this month.That accelerated timeline is in large measure due to the excellent collaboration and cooperation between both organizations. And it serves to underscore the execution competence that comes with an acquisition and established base and then has a track record of success. On the execution side, as highlighted on Slide 11 on the deck. Early well performance is consistent with our stated view that the acquired Ensign inventory has the potential to deliver some of the best returns and highest capital efficiency in the Eagles Ford, and therefore the entire Lower 48. Our first two pads, nine wells in total are outperforming expectations delivering top decile oil productivity in the basin. This year we plan to bring approximately 40 wells to sales on the acquired acreage, accounting for about one-third of our total Eagle Ford program.The Ensign wells are expected to deliver accretive capital efficiency and financial returns from comparable oil productivity to those legacy Eagle Ford program. I'll now hand over to Mike, to provide more color on our 2023 capital program.Michael Henderson: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 12 of our deck. I'll provide a brief overview of the high points of our 2023 capital pool. As expected, consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework and our more S&amp;P less E&amp;P mandate, we expect to deliver strong free cash flow and significant return capital to our shareholders across a wide band of commodity prices as the graphics on the right of the slide show. At our reference price deck, we expect our $1.9 billion to $2 billion capital budget to deliver $2.6 billion adjusted free cash flow at just over a 40% reinvestment paid. As Lee and Dane both highlighted, we expect to return at least $1.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. To deliver these financial outcomes, we'll operate approximately nine rigs and 3 to 4 frac crews on average this year.We expect 2023 capital to be first half weighted, with about 60% of our total capital spend concentrated in the first half of the year largely driven by the timing of our activity. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver maintenance level oil production of approximately 190,000 barrels of oil per day, flat relative to 2022 after incorporating Ensign volumes. As is typical for our business, there will be some standard quarter-to-quarter variability throughout the year. The lower end of our annual guidance range is a good starting point for our first quarter total oil production, approximately 185,000 barrels of oil per day. This is largely a reflection of activity timing and the associated impact on well sales, along with a very modest negative carryover impact from winter storm Ellie, concentrated in the Bakken.With activity and wells to sales weighted to the first two quarters of the year, we expect to see an improving production trend for oil into the second and third quarters. Turning to oil equivalent production. The midpoint of our guidance is 395,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, inclusive of a planned second quarter turnaround in EG that is designed to set us up for a high level of uptime in 2024. Overall, our 2023 plan is a disciplined and high confidence program designed to deliver strong financial and operational outcomes. In the Eagle Ford, we run a 4-rig program. We expect an improving well productivity trend in 2023 from an already strong 2022, due in part to Ensign contributions. In the Bakken, we will run 3 rigs in average again, focusing our activity in our high-quality hectare area of the play, where the average well pays out and licensed six months at current commodity prices.In the Permian, we expect to continue improving our capital efficiency by increasing on average lateral lines to 10,000 feet this year, an increase of over 25% in 2022. While our headline Permian wells sales guidance looks similar to last year, the strong well productivity and competitive drilling and completion performance that we've delivered is getting back to work over the second half of 2022 supports a higher level of capital allocation. We, therefore, plan to spud between 25 and 30 wells this year inclusive of at least one multi-well pad in our Texas Delaware, Meramac Woodford fleet, which will support a higher level of well to sales in early 2024. Our Texas Delaware position is no longer an exploration play. The asset is now fully integrated into our Permian asset development team where it will compete for capital on a heads-up basis with all the other assets.So our Oklahoma asset continues to provide us valuable optionality to a fundamental strengthening of the gas and NGL price environment. We aren't exposing much capital to the asset this year. Rather, near-term activity is limited to a 1.5 rig joint venture program that will allow us to efficiently defend our acreage position and delineate some lower priority acreage limited scope and capital. With that, I'll turn it over to Lee, who will provide an update on our Integrated Gas business in Equatorial Guinea.Lee Tillman: Thank you, Mike. 2022 was an exceptional year for our unique world-class integrated gas business in EG. We delivered over $600 million of equity income more than double our guidance at the beginning of the year. And we generated approximately $900 million of EBITDA. Our results were driven by solid operational performance as well as higher-than-expected commodity pricing, especially for Henry Hub and European natural gas. For 2023, we expect equity income and EBITDA to decline largely due to assume significantly lower commodity prices, especially for natural gas and the already referenced planned turnaround during the second quarter. The outlook beyond 2023, however, is robust as we expect to realize significant EG earnings and cash flow improvement in 2024 on the back of an increase in our global LNG price exposure.A way of background, in addition to our 64% interest in the operated Alba gas condensate field, which produced approximately 60,000 oil equivalent barrels per day on a net basis in 2022. We also have a 56% interest in equity accounted 3.7 MTPA baseload LNG facility. This LNG facility currently processes equity gas from our operated Alba field that is sold on a legacy Henry Hub link contract and third-party Alen gas volumes on a total plus profit sharing basis. The Alba Henry Hub link contract expires at the end of 2023. While we're still working through contractual and commercial details, the bottom line is that beginning January 1, 2024, Alba source LNG will no longer be sold at a Henry Hub linkage. It will be sold into the global LNG market which is expected to drive a significant financial uplift for our company given the material arbitrage between Henry Hub and global LNG pricing.More specifically, at pricing generally consistent with the forward curve or $20 per MMBtu TTF, we're positioned to realize an approximate $500 million EBITDA uplift in comparison to 2023. As there is a wide range of potential global LNG price outcomes in 2024, we've also provided a high side sensitivity to help you better appreciate the leverage we'll have in 2024 to global LNG prices. Assuming an upside case of $40 per MMBtu TTF in 2024 or a price consistent with the average of the trailing 12 months, the potential EBITDA uplift could be in excess of $1 billion. And beyond the significant financial uplift expected in 2024, we remain equally focused on further maximizing the long-term value of our unique EG gas assets by leveraging available haulage through EGL&amp;G.This world-class infrastructure is well positioned in one of the most gas prone areas of West Africa and is a natural aggregation point to monetize both indigenous EG gas as well as discovered undeveloped cross-border opportunities. In summary, for years now, I've reiterated my view that for our company and for our sector to attract increased investor sponsorship, we must deliver financial performance competitive with other investment alternatives in the market, as measured by corporate returns, free cash flow generation and the return of capital. More S&amp;P, less E&amp;D. We've delivered exactly that type of performance over the last two years and not just competitive, but at the very top. And as I said before, our challenge now is to prove that our results are sustainable, quarter in, quarter out, year-end and year out.We believe they are. We're up for the challenge, and I believe our outlook is as strong as it has ever been. Our compelling investment case is simple. We offer a unique and differentiated return of capital framework that provides shareholders first call on cash flow and protect distributions from capital inflation. For 2023, we're providing clear visibility to double-digit shareholder distribution yield. We have an established track record of market-leading free cash flow yield and shareholder distributions at an attractive valuation and offer investors a free cash flow and return of capital profile that competes with any sector and company in the S&amp;P 500 across a wide range of commodity prices. We have delivered per share growth across all the metrics that matter via a consistent share repurchase program that leads our peers in addition to a durable and competitive base dividend.We believe this peer-leading financial delivery is sustainable, underpinned by our high-quality U.S. unconventional portfolio with over a decade of high return inventory and a track record of sector-leading capital efficiency, recently strengthened by the Ensign acquisition. Our portfolio provides commodity leverage with strong oil weighting, coupled with a unique and increasing exposure to global LNG prices that will drive material financial uplift in 2024 and beyond, all underpinned by an investment-grade balance sheet. And finally, we're delivering these results to help meet global oil and gas demand while prioritizing all elements of our ESG performance. To close, I want to again reiterate how proud I am of the way we position our company.We are results driven, but it is also about how we deliver those results, staying true to our core values and responsibly delivering the oil and gas the world needs. The oil and gas that is critical to furthering global economic progress, defending U.S. energy security, limiting billions out of energy poverty and protecting the standard of living, we have all come to enjoy. With that, we can open the line for Q&amp;A.See also 15 Countries that Export the Most Beef and 12 Countries that Export the Most Whiskey.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Microsoft has started to integrate OpenAI’s technology into its search engine Bing, while Google has promised a competitor bot named Bard.However, concerns about their output have grown. Many early testers of Microsoft’s Bing chatbot found that it would produce bizarre answers, including threatening language and incorrect results. ChatGPT has been accused of having a Left-wing bias after refusing to create text praising certain US Republicans, but readily doing so for Democrats.In answer to a parliamentary question from Labour peer Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, Lord Parkinson said: “The Online Safety Bill has been designed to be technology-neutral to future-proof it and to ensure that the legislation keeps pace with emerging technologies.“Content generated by artificial intelligence ‘bots’ is in scope of the Bill, where it interacts with user-generated content, such as on Twitter. Search services using AI-powered features will also be in scope of the search duties outlined in the Bill.”ChatGPT and other so-called large language models are able to generate uncannily human-sounding answers, as well as authoring essays and poems on dozens of subjects.Story continuesTheir rise has led several schools and universities to ban students from using it as a writing aid. Analysts have estimated that ChatGPT already has more than 100m users, and the use of the technology is likely to expand further as Google and Microsoft integrate it into their search engines.The Online Safety Bill requires websites such as social networks and search engines to protect users from harmful content. They will have to prevent children from finding “legal but harmful” material such as that related to abuse, harassment or self-harm, and give adults controls to screen it out.Companies face heavy fines or, in extreme cases, executives could be jailed if Ofcom, which will enforce the laws, finds them to have repeatedly breached them.Last week, Microsoft introduced new limits on its Bing chatbot after finding that long conversations could lead the service to produce emotional or aggressive-seeming responses.]"

He tweeted, “although current-generation AI tools aren’t very scary, I think we are potentially not that far away from potentially scary ones.”He seemed preoccupied with time, predicting that the integration of A.I. tools into society will happen quickly—and the world needs time to adjust.He wrote, “the adaptation to a world deeply integrated with AI tools is probably going to happen pretty quickly; the benefits (and fun!) have too much upside. We also need enough time for our institutions to figure out what to do. Regulation will be critical and will take time to figure out…having time to understand what’s happening, how people want to use these tools, and how society can co-evolve is critical.”His thoughts also turned to how future generations will look back on this point of history and the decisions being made now—and he seemed to hope for some understanding and forgiveness.“I wish that all generations would treat previous generations with indulgence,” he wrote. “Humanity is deeply imperfect. Our grandparents did horrible things; our grandchildren will understand that we did horrible things we don’t yet understand.""“The people who came before us are a complete package of good and bad,” he continued, “and collectively they pushed the world forward; it’s important to view the moral progress of society as an ongoing joint project we are all responsible for. Now it’s our turn. I hope the people of the future will view us the same way.”Story continuesThis week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk distanced himself from OpenAI, which he helped fund and establish as a nonprofit in 2015. Microsoft has invested heavily in OpenAI in recent years and last month indicated it will sink even more money into the venture.On Friday, Musk tweeted, “OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

(NASDAQ:PAYX) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/74-institutional-ownership-paychex-inc-143230661.html,1676817150,STORY,['PAYX'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 74% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Paychex. See our latest analysis for Paychex ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Paychex?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Paychex does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Paychex, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Paychex. B. Golisano is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 8.6%.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PaychexThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Paychex, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$4.4b stake in this US$41b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Paychex. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

On the other hand, dividend stocks remained much more favorable and rewarded investors with strong, stable returns, outperforming both non-dividend stocks and bonds.Additionally, Hartford Funds states that dividends have played a significant role in the returns investors have received during the past half century, as 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index can be attributed to reinvested dividends since 1960, while the contribution of dividend incomes to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index averaged 40% till 2021.Companies with long histories of annual dividend growth are known to have positive performance over time.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”12.

The top household products pick at Morgan Stanley on account of its robust pricing power, strong pet trends and positive corporate strategy changes, Mohsenian states that the near 10% pullback in shares over the last month offers a buying opportunity ""into a structurally attractive name.""

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 2.90%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company also manufactures, sells, and markets other non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. The beverage company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 61 years.

According to the analyst, the company's ""robust"" 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company's 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was the leading stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q3 2022. Overall, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned investments in the company in Q3, worth over $25 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 4.75%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is an American alternative investment management company based in New York City whose private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyouts in the last three decades. Blackstone, Inc. (NYSE:BX) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.91 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.75%, as recorded on February 14.On January 27, BMO Capital analyst Rufus Hone raised the price target on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) to $92 from $85 but maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited the company's Q4 earnings beat and noted that Blackstone is incrementally positive around the outlook for Retail inflows recovering, and should benefit from any ""soft landing"" economic outcome.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds were bullish on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assets We recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team. Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”7. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois, United States. The company is known for its diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition products, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Among Abbott's most well-known brands are Pedialyte, Ensure, Similac, and Glucerna.On January 26, Stifel analyst Rick Wise raised his price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares, telling investors that the company's management had ""an encouragingly positive tone to start 2023"" on its earnings call. He adds that, with Abbott starting off with high-single-digit organic sales growth guidance and $4.30-$4.50 EPS guidance that ""basically brackets current consensus,"" the 2023 setup ""also appears encouraging.""Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.92%, as of February 14. The company has a run of 51 years of consistent dividend growth.At the end of September, 62 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), up from 61 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $3 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas.On February 15, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised the price target on Walmart Inc.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023.  Suggested articles:15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This MonthDisclosure.

(NASDAQ:HST) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 16, 2023Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jamie Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.Jamie Marcus: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel-level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC, and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.With me on today's call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.Jim Risoleo: Thank you, Jamie. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We ended the year with strong operating improvements across our portfolio driven by continued rate strength. For the full year 2022, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of 1.498 billion, all owned hotel EBITDA of $1.573 billion in all owned hotel RevPAR of $196, which helped us achieve the high-end of our full year 2022 guidance range. During the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $364 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.44. Our all owned hotel EBITDA of $373 million in the fourth quarter was 5% above 2019, driven by rate strength out of room revenues, and expense efficiencies resulting from operating improvements. All owned hotel RevPAR for the fourth quarter was approximately $197, a 60-basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019.Story continuesAs a reminder, fourth quarter operations were impacted by Hurricane Ian, yet RevPAR all owned hotel EBITDA and EBITDA margins, though exceeded 2019 levels for the third consecutive quarter since the onset of the pandemic. All owned hotel revenues in the fourth quarter were up 1.1% over the fourth quarter of 2019. While all owned hotel operating expenses were down 40 basis points. In addition to delivering strong operating improvements over the course of 2022, we continued to be recognized as a global leader in corporate responsibility. While we work toward achieving our 2025 environmental and social targets, we introduced our 2050 vision of becoming a net positive company, which is detailed in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report. We now have a total of 10 LEED certified properties, including three LEED Gold hotels, plus our corporate headquarters.In addition, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index World which recognizes global sustainability leaders across all industries for the fourth consecutive year, and we were included in the DJSI North America for the sixth consecutive year. Additionally, we were once again included among the world's most sustainable companies in S&amp;P's Global Sustainability Yearbook and named one of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek. Subsequent to quarter-end, we amended and restated our existing $2.5 billion credit facility to further enhance the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. The agreement reflects no increase in pricing and incorporates our industry leading commitment to ESG by adding incentives linked to portfolio sustainability initiatives, including Green Building Certifications and Renewable Energy Consumption.On the capital allocation front, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.7 billion shares at an average price of $15.93 per share through our common share repurchase program, bringing our total repurchases for the quarter to $27 million. We have approximately $973 million remaining capacity under the repurchase program. While macroeconomic headwinds continue to dominate the headlines, we remain optimistic about the state of travel for several reasons. First, although leisure rates are moderating, they remain well above 2019 levels. For context, transient rates at our resorts were 52% above 2019 in the fourth quarter, compared to 64% in the third quarter. Second, in the fourth quarter, we booked 400,000 group rooms for 2023. In total group revenue pace is down only 70 basis points to the same time 2019.Third, while business transient demand has been uneven, revenue driven by this segment improved 440 basis points compared to 2019 on a quarterly sequential basis. Small and medium-sized businesses are driving the business transient recovery, and they represent a larger share of our corporate demand today. According to American Express Global Business Travel, transactions by this segment reached 80% of pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. Our recent acquisitions continued to contribute to our outperformance and are substantially ahead of our underwriting expectations. Based on full year 2022 results, even up from the seven hotels we acquired in 2021 put us at the bottom-end of our targeted range of 10x to 12x EBITDA, well ahead of our plan stabilization period.Looking back on our transaction activity since 2018, we have acquired $3.5 billion of assets at a 13.7x EBITDA multiple and dispose of $4.9 billion of assets at 17x EBITDA multiple, including $954 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures. It is worth noting that this quarter, we moved the 2017 comparison of our all owned hotel results from 2019 to 2022, as our 2022 results reflect more normalized operations. Comparing all owned hotel 2022 results for our current portfolio to 2017. We have increased the RevPAR of our assets by 9%, by 15%, the EBITDA per key by 31% and avoided considerable business disruption associated with capital projects. Moving back to fourth quarter operations and starting with the hurricane update, we estimate that Hurricane Ian impacted our fourth quarter RevPAR growth by 220 basis points, our adjusted EBITDAre by $15 million and our all owned hotel EBITDA margin by 40 basis points.On a full year basis that translates to an all owned hotel RevPAR impact of 60 basis points and all owned hotel EBITDA impact of $18 million and an all owned hotel EBITDA margin impact of 10 basis points. As a reminder, the Hyatt Regency coconut point opened in November, and we expect to reopen the remaining pool facilities in Water Park in June. The Ritz-Carlton, Naples remains closed, and we are targeting a phased reopening strategy beginning this summer. Reconstruction at the Ritz-Carlton will enhance the resilience of the property by elevating critical equipment, introducing dry flood-proofing measures and replacing major equipment with more efficient machinery. In addition, while the hotel is closed, we are avoiding future disruption by executing planned capital projects that would have otherwise impacted operations.While we are still evaluating the total financial impacts of the storm, we currently estimate the total property damage and remediation costs for all impacted properties in Florida to be between $200 million and $220 million. We are insured for $325 million per name windstorm with a $15 million deductible resulting in potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs. Based on our current reopening plans for Ritz-Carlton, Naples, we believe our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover substantially all the property damage as well as the near-term loss of business. Thus far this year, we have received approximately $50 million of insurance proceeds related to our plans. Continuing with fourth quarter results. Transient revenue was up 60 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 with strong rate increases making up for the volume shortfall resulting from lower business transient demand, light cancellations during the holidays, colder weather in Florida and hurricane displacement at Hyatt Coconut Point and Ritz-Carlton, Naples.Revenue growth was driven by Orlando, Phoenix and Hawaii, which offset declines in San Francisco and the Florida Gulf Coast. Our resort properties continue to outperform with 13% transient rate growth over 2021. In the fourth quarter, we had 6 resorts with transient rates above $1,000 led by the Four Seasons Jackson Hole at over $2,200 and the Four Seasons Orlando at close to $2,000. Turning to Group. This is the second consecutive quarter group revenue exceeded 2019 driven by 10% rate growth. In the fourth quarter, our hotels sold 954,000 group rooms, bringing our total group room nights sold for 2022 to $3.8 million, which represents approximately 84% of 2019 actual group room nights. Total group revenue for 2022 was down just 11% to 2019 as 6% rate growth and contribution helped to offset lower demand.In 2023, we currently have 2.9 million definite group room nights on the books which represents 80% of full year 2022 group room nights. This compares to 71% on the books at the same time last year for 2022, representing a 9-point improvement. Group rate on the books for 2023 is up nearly 6% to the same time last year, a 140-basis point increase since the third quarter. In addition, group revenue pace is up approximately 17% to the same time last year. We are very encouraged by the large group base we have on the books, particularly given short-term booking trends. Sourav will discuss more operational detail in our 2023 outlook in a few minutes. In addition to delivering operational improvements, we continue to execute on our three strategic objectives all of which are aimed at elevating the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio.Hotel, Resort, ServicePhoto by Tholaal Mohamed on UnsplashAs a reminder, our objectives include redefining the hotel operating model with our managers, gaining market share at hotels through comprehensive innovations, and strategically allocating capital to development ROI projects. As it relates to our first strategic objective, it is important to note that we have achieved the bulk of the $100 million to $150 million of expense savings associated with redefining the operating model. In order to achieve the high-end of the range, we will need to get back to 2019 business volumes and as of the fourth quarter, occupancy was still 10 points below the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to portfolio reinvestment. Our 2023 capital expenditure guidance range is $600 million to $725 million, which reflects approximately $275 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning in ROI projects.The projects include a transformational renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani. The Phoenician Canyon Suites filler expansion and completing construction of the tower expansion, guestroom renovation and lobby transformation at Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was delayed by Hurricane Ian. To-date, we have completed 14 out of 16 assets in our Marriott transformational capital program, and we will complete the San Diego Marriott Marquis by the end of this month. The final property, the Washington Marriott and Metro Center is underway, and we expect it to be completed in May. It is worth noting that actual 2022 capital expenditures came in at the low-end of our guidance range. As such, the midpoint of our 2023 range is $160 million higher than last year, which is driven by carryover capital and an estimated $100 million to $125 million of capital expenditures related to hurricane restoration work, which we expect to be reimbursed by insurance claims.To conclude my remarks, we are extremely proud of the results we achieved in 2022, and we are confident that the quality of our portfolio, our ability to reinvest in our assets and our fortress balance sheet will allow us to continue our strong performance in 2023. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav.Sourav Ghosh: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our fourth quarter operations full year 2023 guidance and our balance sheet. Starting with business mix, overall transient revenue was up 60 basis points to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by a 22% rate growth. Thanksgiving and the festive season saw RevPAR growth of 5% and 6% over 2019, respectively, driven by rate growth of over 30% for both periods. Despite impacts from flight cancellations and cold weather in Florida during the festive season, occupancy continued to increase sequentially this holiday. Looking ahead, holidays in the first quarter of 2023 are shaping up well. Martin Luther King Junior weekend achieved a revenue that was 22% above last year, driven by occupancy.Peasants' Day and Spring Break both have revenue pace ahead of 2022. Business transient revenue was down 18% to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by 2% rate growth. This is a meaningful improvement from the start of 2022 when business transient revenue was down 48% to the first quarter of 2019. As we have discussed previously, properties are targeting high single-digit business transient rate growth in 2023. During the fourth quarter, business transient demand was in line with pre-pandemic monthly seasonality and was driven by San Francisco, Washington D.C. and New York, with New York just 5% behind 2019. Turning to group. This marks the second quarter the revenue has surpassed 2019 levels. Group room revenues were 2% above the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by 10% rate growth.While overall group room demand was down 8% to 2019, properties in New York and Phoenix achieved group demand above 2019 levels. The short-term booking trend continued with in the quarter, for the quarter group rooms sold up 21% over the fourth quarter of 2019. The majority of the rooms booked were in Washington D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and New York. Corporate Group revenue was up 6% in the quarter, surpassing 2019 for the second quarter in a row, driven by a 14% rate increase. Our performance was driven by hotels in Orlando, Phoenix, Maui, New York and New Orleans. All 3 months in the quarter had corporate group revenue ahead of 2019 driven by rate and revenue was up substantially at both convention and resort properties. Association Group revenue was down 16% in the fourth quarter compared to 2019 despite rate growth of over 7%.The revenue decline was driven by volume losses in San Francisco, Boston and New Orleans. However, San Diego, New York and Phoenix had association group demand ahead of 2019 levels. While association revenue was down in the fourth quarter, we saw meaningful pickup in booking activity for future years in the month of December. Additionally, rates compared to 2019 improved sequentially each month in the quarter from up 3% in October to up 15% in December. Wrapping up on groups with social, military, educational, religious and fraternal or SMERF groups, revenue was up 29% over 2019 driven equally by a 14% increase in rooms sold and a 13% increase in rate. Sports teams and weddings drove increases in Washington D.C., Los Angeles and New Orleans.Shifting gears to margins and expenses, our fourth quarter all owned hotel EBITDA margin came in at 29.5%, which is 110 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2019. We attribute the margin expansion to strong rates and increased out-of-room revenues, combined with operating model expense efficiencies despite the fact that Hurricane Ian negatively impacted margins by 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. As expected, the margin gap to 2019 narrowed relative to prior quarters due to continued inflationary pressures and more normalized staffing levels at our hotels. Our efforts to redefine the operating model continue to yield positive results even with occupancy still meaningfully below 2019 levels and elevated pressure on wage rates which ended the year up 5% on a year-over-year basis.As detailed in our earnings release, moving forward, we will cease presentation of all owned hotel results and return to a comparable presentation for our hotel level results. We believe this will provide investors with better understanding of underlying growth trends for our current portfolio without impacts from properties that experienced closures lasting one-month or longer due to renovations or property damage. We have removed Hyatt Regency Coconut Point and the Ritz-Carlton, Naples from our comparable operations in our full year 2023 forecast due to closures caused by Hurricane Ian. Turning to our outlook for 2023. Current macroeconomic headwinds and the potential for an economic slowdown are competing with the margin recovery. That said, we continue to be optimistic about the future of travel.Our performance this year will depend on our ability to maintain high rated business at our resorts and the continued improvement of group, business transient and international inbound travel. Given the significant macroeconomic uncertainty in the second half of 2023, we have provided a wider guidance range than normal, which assumes a slowdown in the second half of the year. The low-end contemplates a severe slowdown, while the high-end assumes a mild one. For the first quarter, we expect RevPAR growth to be between 24% and 27% as a result of easier comparisons due to Omicron, which is expected to bolster full year growth. For the remaining three quarters, we expect year-over-year RevPAR changes to be down low-single digits at the low-end of our guidance range to up low-single digits at the high-end of our range.Looking ahead to recent trends, preliminary January comparable hotel RevPAR is expected to be approximately $184, a 67% increase over January 2022 and a 3.5% increase over January 2019. Taken together, for the full year, we anticipate comparable RevPAR growth of between 2% and 8% over 2022. Additionally, staffing levels are closer to stable and hotel operating costs are expected to increase in comparison to 2022. As a result, we expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 360 basis points year-over-year at the low-end of our guidance to down 210 basis points at the high-end. Though, we expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down year-over-year, we expect margins in 2023 to be only slightly down to 2019 despite lagging occupancy and four years of inflationary pressures.This reflects our efforts to transform the portfolio and evolve the hotel operating model. It is particularly impressive when you consider that our total expense CAGR since 2019 is only 1.1% versus the core CPI CAGR of 4.1%. The margin decline year-over-year is driven by closer to stable, staffing levels at our hotels, higher utility and insurance expenses, lower attrition and cancellation fees, which totaled approximately $100 million in 2022 and occupancy below 2019 levels. As we noted throughout last year, 2022 margins were not sustainable, particularly when you consider the limited services provided at many of our hotels in the first half of the year, the staffing lag and the elevated inflationary pressures. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate comparable RevPAR growth of 5% compared to 2022, a comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 29% and full year adjusted EBITDAre of $1.460 billion.Our 2023 full year adjusted EBITDAre includes an expected $11 million contribution from Hyatt Coconut Point and the Ritz-Carlton, Naples which are excluded from our comparable hotel set. The pre-hurricane estimated contribution from these two hotels, including the New Tower at Naples was expected to be an additional $71 million in 2023. It is important to note that we have not included the business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian in our 2023 guidance. In 2023, we expect wage rates to increase 5%. In the aggregate, from 2019 through 2023, we expect wage rates and utilities to increase 20% and insurance to increase approximately 100%. In 2023, we also expect attrition and cancellation fees to revert to historical levels. For context, in 2019, region and benefits comprise approximately 50% of our total comparable expenses, utilities and insurance comprised approximately 5%, attrition and cancellation fees were $50 million, and occupancy is still 10 points below 2019 as of the fourth quarter of 2022.Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is 5.2 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, and we have no significant maturities until April 2024. As of today's call, we have $2.4 billion in total available liquidity, which includes $200 million of FF&amp;E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. We ended 2022 at 2.4x net leverage. And since our last call, both S&amp;P and Fitch have revised our issuer outlooks to positive from stable. Wrapping up, in January, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share, which included a $0.20 special dividend. The Board of Directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 on our common stock to be paid on April 17, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2023.All future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors though we expect to be able to maintain our quarterly dividend at a sustainable level, taking into consideration potential macroeconomic factors. To conclude, we believe our portfolio, our balance sheet and our team are well positioned to continue outperforming, and we will continue to be strategic in the current macroeconomic environment. With that, we would be happy to take your questions.

36,128133ef-82cd-3f81-9ea8-4d6b9cacf4cc,PM,2023-02-20,Capital Investments At Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) Point To A Promising Future,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capital-investments-philip-morris-international-110031294.html,1676890831,STORY,['PM'],"[What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at Philip Morris International's (NYSE:PM) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Philip Morris International is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.36 = US$12b ÷ (US$62b - US$27b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 36%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Tobacco industry average of 11%. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Philip Morris International compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Philip Morris International here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Philip Morris International. The company has consistently earned 36% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 27% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If Philip Morris International can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.On a separate but related note, it's important to know that Philip Morris International has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 44%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Philip Morris International's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Philip Morris International has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. In light of this, the stock has only gained 26% over the last five years for shareholders who have owned the stock in this period. So because of the trends we're seeing, we'd recommend looking further into this stock to see if it has the makings of a multi-bagger.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Philip Morris International and understanding these should be part of your investment process.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

37,8fd145a0-614f-3b83-b580-a89a7b06c373,PM,2023-02-20,10 Best Stocks To Buy For Income,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-buy-income-155146580.html,1676821906,STORY,"['O', 'KMI', 'MO', 'HAS', 'T-PC', 'VZ', 'DOW', 'PM']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 best stocks to buy for income. If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Buy For Income.After logging its worst annual performance in 14 years back in 2022, the S&amp;P 500 kicked off 2023 with a very strong January. The benchmarked index gained a little over 6% for the month as the first wave of fourth-quarter earnings reports came in better than many had feared. This performance bodes well for the remainder of 2023, at least from a historical perspective. However, Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners, says that the stock market and the economy aren’t in the clear just yet. According to Saperstein:“Markets have been reacting favorably to moderating inflation and expectations of a reduced pace of Fed tightening, but the lag effects of the Fed’s tightening so far will slow the economy in the second half of 2023 and cause analysts to slash earnings estimates, which ultimately is a headwind for stocks.”With persisting inflationary pressures and a possibility of a recession, investors are looking towards options to generate stable income. Dividend stocks have previously dealt favorably with uncertain market conditions and boosted investors’ confidence amid fluctuations. According to a report by iShares, dividend stocks reported a 12.5% decline in bear markets from 1978 to 2021, compared with a 30.7% drop in non-dividend stocks. Dividend-paying stocks tend to weather down equity markets better than non-payers. This seems intuitive, as the ability to consistently pay dividends suggests that a company is mature, has cash flow and cash on hand, all of which point towards the company in question being relatively stable.Companies that have historically raised their dividends consistently are known to demonstrate better income-generating abilities and market resilience compared to their peers. In that regard, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) are among the many names on this list that boast decades of dividend growth streaks and are outperforming the broader index this year so far.Story continues10 Best Stocks To Buy For IncomePhoto by Annie Spratt on UnsplashOur Methodology:We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds' holdings and picked the top 10 dividend-paying stocks with yields over 4.5% as of February 14.

For more real estate stocks, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Real Estate Stocks Now. The real estate sector is one of the most lucrative industries in the world. Its importance is underscored by the fact that some of the largest economies in the world are inextricably linked to real estate development. The biggest example of the sector's importance is the 2008 financial crisis. This crisis, the after effects of which we are dealing with even today, shook the real estate industry badly . Spurred by a policy of low interest rates, homeowners borrowed extravagantly to own their properties, and banks then used these loans as an asset to sell their interest payments to investors. However, once the interest rates went up, the mortgage owners started to default - kicking a vicious cycle that forced the Federal Reserve to pump billions of dollars into the economy to prevent an all out collapse. How much did the Fed spend to prevent disaster? Well, its latest balance shows that while before the crisis its balance sheet had roughly $0.9 trillion of assets, these swelled to $2.2 trillion by the end of 2008. Effectively, the central bank had to more than double its assets to bail out big banks and the economy, and it is still struggling to contain it, as the coronavirus pandemic further exacerbated the problem and led to the balance sheet swelling to $8.96 trillion.Another more recent example of the perhaps outsized role that real estate plays come from the world's second largest economy, China. Spurred by the financial difficulties of China Evergrande Group (OTCMKTS:EGRNF), the crisis continues to threaten not only the Chinese market but also the global economy due to the interlinking of large asset managers such as BlackRock with the Chinese stock market. In order to stimulate real estate, and by extension the broader economy, the Chinese government allowed low interest rates and increased bank lending to real estate companies to build properties and increase home ownership in the country. These stimuli led to the home prices in Shanghai rising by a whopping 150% between 2003 and 2010 and paved the way for excessive borrowing for big construction companies who then used these loans to pay other debts and take out more loans. The spiral led to the government making new laws, called the Three Red Arrows, which limited real estate developers' ability to raise new funds. Steeped in debt, Evergrande found it difficult to raise working capital and missed bond payments.Story continuesIn terms of market value, the real estate sector is one of the most valuable in the world. According to research from Allied Market, the global real estate market was worth a whopping $28 trillion in 2021. From then until 2031, the firm believes that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% to sit at an estimated $48 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Cementing the importance of China in the industry, Allied Market Research points out that Asia Pacific is the world's largest real estate sector, and that it accounts for more than two fifths of the global market. However, in terms of growth, the research firm believes that Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa (LAMEA) market will be the strongest growing region, as it outpaces the broader industry by posting a CAGR of 6.4%.Today we'll look at some of the biggest money makers in the real estate world, with the top performers being Longfor Group Holdings Limited (HKG:0960.HK), China Overseas Land &amp; Investment Limited (HKG:0688.HK), and Prologis, Inc.

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexManaged by Goldman Sachs Funds, GLOV has amassed assets over $614.89 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. GLOV, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the GOLDMAN SACHS ACTBT WORLD LW VL PL EQ ID.The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity Index delivers exposure to large and mid-capitalization equity securities of developed market issuers, including the United States.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for this ETF, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.67%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 2.49% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Oreilly Automotive Inc (ORLY).GLOV's top 10 holdings account for about 7.08% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has added about 3.66% so far.With about 387 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index.

40,0e4f5551-879f-3343-926b-3f7cf8e0b0d2,SLB,2023-02-20,Schlumberger Limited's (NYSE:SLB) institutional investors lost 6.9% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limiteds-nyse-slb-institutional-110028365.html,1676890828,STORY,['SLB'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Schlumberger's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 21 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have been selling lately To get a sense of who is truly in control of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 6.9% in value last week. However, the 35% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Schlumberger. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Schlumberger?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Schlumberger already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Schlumberger's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Schlumberger is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.8% of shares outstanding. With 7.5% and 6.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of SchlumbergerThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Schlumberger Limited. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$166m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Schlumberger. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Now, at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.Quentin McMillan: Thanks very much and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures.The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement, and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com. Finally, today's remarks will discuss the results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial Incorporated. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its own earnings call tomorrow on Friday, February 17, and will provide additional details on its results.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.Peter Zaffino: Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on certain topics, including Life Retirement results and our path to a 10% or greater ROCE, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&amp;A portion of the call. Today, I will cover four topics. First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review highlights from the full year, including some of our major accomplishments, which were remarkable given the very challenging conditions we faced throughout 2022 in the equity markets and the insurance industry. Third, I will unpack in some detail market conditions leading up to January 1 reinsurance renewals, where we saw significant shifts that we believe will impact the industry throughout 2023 and perhaps longer.Story continuesSuffice it to say, this 1/1 renewal season was the most challenged that many, including myself, have seen in our careers. And fourth, I will outline our 2023 priorities and outlook regarding capital management. Before turning to our results, I'd like to welcome Sabra to the call. We are fortunate to have her in the interim CFO role, while Shane is on a medical leave. Regarding Shane, I am personally deeply appreciative of the tremendous outreach from many of you. The number of people who have sent good wishes for a speedy recovery is incredibly meaningful to me and our management team and particularly to Shane and his family. We look forward to welcoming him back to AIG. Now let me begin with a brief overview of AIG's fourth quarter results.Adjusted after-tax income in the fourth quarter was $1 billion and $1.36 per diluted common share. We repurchased approximately 780 million of AIG common stock and redeemed $1.8 billion of debt. AIG paid $243 million in dividends in the fourth quarter and Corebridge paid two dividends, totaling approximately $300 million following its IPO in September of 2022. Turning to General Insurance. In the fourth quarter, the accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs, improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 88.4%, representing the 18th consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Notably, underwriting income in the fourth quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $635 million. Global Commercial drove the year-over-year increase, achieving an accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs, of 84.1%, a 380 basis point improvement and a 69% increase in underwriting income.Global Personal reported an accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs, of 100.4%, a 610 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, as we continued to reposition this portfolio. Moving to Global Commercial, on an FX-adjusted basis, North America commercial net premiums written increased 3% and international increased 2%. Global Commercial had strong renewal retention in its in-force portfolio and new business continued to be strong. Turning to REIT, momentum continued in North America commercial with overall rate increases in the quarter of 3%, 7% if you exclude financial lines and 9% if you also exclude workers' compensation. These rate increases were driven by retail property at 15%, Lexington at 12% and excess casualty at 9%, and the exposure increase in the North America portfolio was 3%.International commercial rate increases were 4%, driven by Asia Pacific at 9% and EMEA at 7%, and the exposure increase in the international portfolio was around 2%. Pricing, which includes rate plus exposure, was up 6% in both North America and international. While we experienced downward pressure on rate in certain lines early in the fourth quarter, we saw a reacceleration of price increases towards the end of the quarter. For example, retail property was up 15% in the fourth quarter with rate improvement of 24% in December when market impacts from increased catastrophes started to be felt. We saw a similar upward movement at Lexington and particularly within the property portfolio with December seeing the strongest rate increases in the fourth quarter.Overall, we continue to earn rate above loss cost trends, which contributed to positive margin expansion. In Global Personal, starting with North America, net premiums written declined 7%, reflecting our ongoing reshaping of this portfolio, particularly in the high and ultra-high net worth businesses that are part of PCG. Later in my remarks, I will discuss our announcement on Monday relating to PCG and our partnership with Stone Point Capital to create a new Managing General Agency, or MGA. In International Personal, net premiums written slightly increased by 1% on an FX-adjusted basis due to a rebound in travel and growth in A&amp;H. Now turning to the full year. We made tremendous progress throughout 2022 on a number of key priorities. I could not be more pleased with our team's ability to execute on multiple complex strategic objectives across AIG at once.Our most significant and impactful accomplishment was completing the IPO of Corebridge in September of 2022 despite the very challenging equity market conditions we had to navigate. Notably, Corebridge was last year's largest IPO in the U.S. and the largest financial services IPO since 2020. We also continue to grow underwriting income in General Insurance, which increased approximately $1 billion year-over-year, the second year in a row with over $1 billion of growth in underwriting income. As I noted on last quarter's call, we also reached significant milestones on AIG 200 that have modernized our technology infrastructure and operational capabilities while executing on an exit run rate savings of $1 billion, six months ahead of schedule.We also changed AIG's investment management strategy and structure through successful partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock, and we are seeing the benefits of these partnerships across AIG and Corebridge. Turning to full year consolidated financial results for AIG. Adjusted after-tax income in 2022 reached $3.6 billion and was $4.55 per diluted common share. We returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through $5.1 billion of AIG common stock repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. We finished 2022 with 734 million shares outstanding, a 10% decrease since the end of 2021. And we executed on a number of capital management actions to establish the standalone Corebridge capital structure while reducing AIG debt by roughly $10 billion. Consolidated financial debt outstanding was approximately $21 billion at year-end with $11.8 billion at AIG and $9.4 billion at Corebridge.Now let me cover full year 2022 results for General Insurance. As you know, an important aspect of our turnaround over the last few years has been instituting a culture of underwriting excellence. And our rigor in this area is now clearly benefiting our financial results. General Insurance achieved underwriting income of $2 billion in 2022, despite the industry again experiencing over $100 billion of insured natural catastrophe losses. And we exceeded our combined ratio commitment by achieving a sub-90 accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs, in all four quarters. As I've noted on prior calls, and it's worth repeating, since 2018, we completely overhauled our underwriting standards and overlaid these standards with a comprehensive reinsurance program that can adapt to market conditions into our portfolio as it continues to change and improve.Overall, gross limits deployed were reduced by over $1.2 trillion during this period. We also meaningfully and deliberately shifted our global portfolio mix in order to reposition AIG for the future. For example, Global Commercial now represents 74% of our net premiums written, up from 57% in 2018. And Lexington is now 17% of our North America commercial business, up from 12% in 2018. If you exclude Validus Re, Lexington is now 23% of North America commercial. As a result of this work, our current portfolio is very well positioned for 2023. I will discuss in more detail later, when I review January 1 reinsurance renewals, how market dynamics have shifted and how AIG should benefit as we look to capitalize on attractive opportunities for better risk-adjusted returns.Now let me highlight a few of the key businesses in General Insurance that contributed to our performance in 2022. Lexington, our market-leading excess and surplus lines business, had 18% net premiums written growth in 2022, up over 50% since we transitioned this business to focus on the wholesale market. This business also increased underwriting profitability, excluding CATs, by 60%, and it achieved a sub-80% accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs, for 2022. Glatfelter continued its terrific performance, growing net premiums written by 14%, increasing underwriting income and achieving an 85% accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs. The acquisition of Glatfelter allowed us to significantly elevate the quality of our programs business. Global Specialty, which includes our global marine, energy and aviation businesses, grew net premiums written by over 15% on an FX-adjusted basis.This was driven by strong client retention of 88%, new business growth and rate increases across the portfolio. Global Specialty generated strong earnings in 2022 with an impressive accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, of 80%. These are just some examples of businesses that we prioritized last year based on their market position, our differentiated value proposition to clients and our ability to generate strong underwriting results. We see great opportunities for these businesses going forward, and they are strong anchors for AIG that we expect will contribute to profitable growth in 2023. Our Global Personal business performed well considering some of the post-pandemic headwinds we saw in the first half of 2022 and our strategic repositioning of the business.Also, as I mentioned on our last call, the impact from deemed hospitalizations in Japan and to a lesser extent Taiwan contributed over $160 million in losses in 2022, having a 290 basis point impact on the International Personal accident year combined ratio. This accident held product was discontinued in 2022. Turning to full year net premiums written. General Insurance grew 4% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by 6% growth in Global Commercial. North America grew 7% and International Commercial grew 6%. We had strong renewal retention in our in-force portfolio with North America improving by 300 basis points to 86% and International achieving 86% for the full year. And as a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.Turning to underwriting profitability for the full year. 2022 was another year with strong progress. The General Insurance accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs, was 88.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year. The full year saw a 180 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio, ex-CATs, and a 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Global Commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs, of 84.5%, an improvement of 460 basis points year-over-year. The loss ratio was the biggest contributor with a 330 basis point improvement, and the combined ratio, including CATs and PYD of 89.6%, represented a 920 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs, in Global Personal deteriorated 430 basis points to 99.2% for the reasons I've outlined before.Now let me turn to reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. As I stated on our last earnings call, we knew this renewal season will be very challenging and lead to fundamental changes in the market that would impact 1/1 renewals. The market was faced with a combination of factors that added further pressure to dynamics that were already creating considerable stress. We had top global macroeconomic trends. We had geopolitical uncertainty. We had short-term pressure on the asset side of the balance sheet as a consequence of rising interest rates, inflation and currency fluctuation. We had additional natural catastrophe losses late in the fourth quarter, and increasing frequency and severity of secondary perils continued. And 2022 ended with over $130 billion of insured natural catastrophe losses, making 2022 the fifth costliest year on record for insurers, with five out of the last six years having exceeded $100 billion.Hurricane Ian, in particular, proved to be a catalyst that changed market dynamics even more significantly than expected and ultimately led to shifts in the market that required the industry to rethink reinsurance placements and the commensurate changes that needed to take place in the primary market. The unprecedented levels of natural catastrophes on a global scale massively impacted the reinsurance market in a couple of ways. Increased natural CAT activity has resulted in elevated property CAT ceded loss ratios with average incurred loss ratios from 2017 through 2022 exceeding 85% compared to 2012 through 2016 when average incurred loss ratios trended below 30%, a dramatic deterioration. And over the last five years, secondary perils contributed more than 50% to ultimate loss when compared to primary perils.These market dynamics also impacted the supply of reinsurance and retrocessional capacity and the cost of capital increase for the industry, which impacted almost all lines of business and territories, regardless of loss experience. On top of all of this, very little new capital entered the market. Available capital is estimated to have decreased approximately 20% year-over-year. Now let me outline what happened in the property CAT and retro markets in particular, due to the high level of CAT losses in 2022, which were further exacerbated by events in the fourth quarter. 50% of global property CAT limits, which we estimate to be $425 billion, renewed at January 1. Approximately 70% of global retro limits estimated at $60 billion incept at January 1.Reinsurers heavily reliant on peak peril retro protection face greater pressure as a result, whereas larger more diversified reinsurers were better able to manage retro capacity constraints. As a result, a majority of programs placed on January 1 saw insurance companies forced to increase retentions. Despite these market challenges, AIG navigated this complex and intense renewal season extremely well. We knew we were in a strong position heading into January 1, given the repositioning and the improved quality of our global portfolio, coupled with our considerable efforts to reduce our gross portfolio peak exposures. As we expected, this allowed us to capitalize on many attractive opportunities, and this proved to be a competitive advantage as we had an exceptionally successful renewal season.Client, Cooperation, BusinessPhoto by Cytonn Photography on UnsplashIt's also worth noting that AIG's reinsurance purchasing is, by design, more heavily weighted to January 1 than the wider market. The benefits of this are twofold. Concentrating the bulk of our purchasing at January 1 allows AIG to maximize the outcome across all of our reinsurance placements. And we have clear line of sight on our reinsurance cost for the full year, which is particularly valuable in a market, which we believe will continue to be incredibly challenging. Some of the highlights of our January placements include the following. With respect to property catastrophe placements, we obtained more limit than we purchased in 2022, and we believe we have the lowest attachment points on a return period measurement for North America windstorm and earthquake amongst our peer group, and our modeled exhaust limits are at higher return periods compared to last year for each of our placements.These placements should further reduce volatility, which is something we remain very focused on and they provide us with significant balance sheet protection in the event one or a series of significant catastrophe events occur. Specifically, we separately made appropriate changes to our North America property CAT treaties to reflect our improving portfolio with the retention of our commercial CAT portfolio attaching at $500 million and Lexington in our programs business having an attachment point of $300 million. The property CAT aggregate cover that we placed has four retentions before attaching, and for North America, Japan, and Rest of World, it now could attach in the second event, which is an improvement from 2022. Our property CAT per current structures largely stayed the same for International, and we believe they are market-leading with Japan's retention staying flat at $200 million and the Rest of World attaching at $125 million.Many factors improved our overall property CAT reinsurance program, with highlights being: we were able to attain approximately $6 billion of limit, including increasing our per occurrence excess of loss placement; we maintained low attachment points on a model basis; we received support for a $500 million aggregate placement; and our overall spend for AIG increased less than 10% on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis versus 2022. With respect to PCG, we accelerated portfolio remediation, which is driving further gross exposure reductions in key CAT-exposed states where loss costs, inflation and necessary modelling changes have not kept pace. This allowed us to reduce the total limit purchase for the PCG-specific CAT program, which partially offset increased pricing pressure due to Hurricane Ian.Overall, casualty renewals, both excess of loss and our quota share placements, renewed close to expiring terms on a risk-adjusted basis with no impact on ceding commissions. Our reinsurance partners maintain their support for AIG with consistent capacity deployment and reinsurance terms and clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio. The outcomes we achieved at January 1 also reflect the value of the investments we have made in our reinsurance strategy and, coupled with our relationships and credibility with reinsurance partners, are a testament to the confidence the reinsurance marketplace has in AIG and its management team. We appreciate the ongoing support we have received from our reinsurance partners. As we look ahead to 2023, the world faces many uncertainties.And in uncertain times, our role as a market-leading global insurance company is even more important. With the momentum we have built and the strength of our portfolio, AIG is now extremely well positioned to strategically grow and lead the market by providing thoughtful expert advice on risk solutions for our clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders. Like 2022 we have set out ambitious strategic and operational priorities for 2023. We will continue to improve and invest in lines of business and General Insurance, where we see significant growth potential, notably Lexington and Global Specialty. I highlight Lexington because it is presented and will continue to present tremendous growth and profitability opportunities for us. And early indications are that the rate momentum we saw in this business at the end of 2022 and into early 2023 will continue.We expect meaningful growth in Lexington this year, led by Property where, over the last few years, we have prudently tightened limits, improved terms and conditions and increased profitability, while driving top line growth. We also plan to increase investment in our assumed reinsurance business in 2023, particularly through Validus Re. As we have discussed on prior calls, over the past few years, we've been highly focused on driving value through a disciplined approach, involving strong risk assessments, sound portfolio construction, a steadfast commitment to underwriting excellence and prudent capital management. Over this period of time, the derisking within Validus Re was particularly acute in the Global Property CAT market, where year-over-year, we reduced participations across the portfolio while concurrently purchasing sound retrocessional protections to prudently manage the portfolio and reduce volatility, all in line with our cycle management strategy.As a result, we were in a strong position to capitalize on attractive opportunities at January 1. The property market, in particular, repositioned and became very compelling in terms of risk-adjusted rates along with enhanced structures as well as beneficial terms and conditions. Rate changes within Property CAT range between 30% and 100% in the U.S. as well as in peak zones outside the U.S. Risk-adjusted rate increases were approximately 50% in the U.S. Property and 35% in International Property and similarly, average margin improvement was approximately 50% year-over-year across the entire portfolio. Property CAT ROEs for both the U.S. and International business increased by greater than 100% year-over-year. Additionally, we obtained improved terms and conditions, including favorable movement in attachment points in all Property lines.For Casualty lines, quota shares remained sound with ceding commissions moving favorably for reinsurers by one to two points, along with terms and conditions remaining in line or improved. The result of these actions included net premiums written at January 1 increased over $500 million or 50% year-over-year. This increase was driven roughly 30% from U.S., property 15% from International Property, 45% from casualty placements and the remaining 10% was from Specialty, including Marine and Energy. The majority of new property limit was deployed to existing clients with a significant level of private terms being achieved on our U.S. property writings. Looking ahead, we will continue our measured approach for other renewals. For example, if meaningful market changes continue, we will carefully consider our positions at the April 1 Japan renewals, and we will continue to be very cautious with capital deployed at June 1 in Florida.Turning to Private Client Group or PCG, this business remains a strategic priority for us in 2023. As you know, over the last two years, we have undertaken a significant re-underwriting effort in this portfolio, reduced aggregate exposure, transitioned certain states to the non-admitted market and developed strong partnerships with Lloyd's and reinsurers to reduce volatility. On Monday, we announced our intention to launch, in partnership with Stone Point Capital, a newly formed MGA that will underwrite on behalf of AIG and eventually other capital providers in the high- and ultra-high net worth markets. AIG will transfer core PCG solutions to the MGA, which will offer a single end-to-end broker and client portal, a comprehensive set of product offerings, a simplified data warehouse and the underwriting capabilities of AIG.The MGA will be rebranded as Private Client Select, or PCS, and will be led by Kathleen Zortman and our current team at PCG. We see this new structure as a logical next step in the evolution of PCG and believe it will create significant value for clients, brokers and other stakeholders. Additionally, expense discipline will continue to be a priority for AIG. In addition to savings from AIG 200 that we expect to earn in during 2023, we plan to move $300 million of expenses currently sitting in AIG corporate GOE to Corebridge upon deconsolidation. Separately, we will continue to align our target operating model and further reduce absolute expenses across AIG Parent and General Insurance to reflect the fact that AIG is becoming one company. This year, we will also remain focused on completing the operational separation of Corebridge from AIG, and we are working towards a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock by the end of the first quarter, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals.Our current expectation is that the majority of net proceeds of the secondary offering will be used for AIG common stock repurchases. And as I stated on our last call, we are revisiting AIG's dividend, which has not changed in many years. We expect to say more about this on our first quarter call in May. With respect to capital management priorities, in 2022, we did a significant amount of work to materially improve the capital structures of both AIG and Corebridge. With the reduction in AIG debt we achieved, our post-deconsolidation leverage will be in line with best-in-class peers. And with respect to share buybacks, we have $3.8 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. Our balanced capital management philosophy will continue to allow for investment in growth opportunities, while returning appropriate levels of capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.We also remain open to compelling inorganic growth opportunities, should they arise. Before turning the call over to Sabra, I would like to pause and say that 2022 was another incredibly important year for AIG. Our colleagues did an exceptional job, particularly on the Corebridge IPO and the continued underwriting and operational improvements that are clearly showing through in our financial results. Our journey to be a top-performing company continues, and I fully expect 2023 to be another year with significant momentum and progress across the organization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.Sabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. Today, I will review net investment income, additional color on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results in capital management and also update you on the progress we are making on our path to a 10%-plus adjusted return on common equity or ROCE. Turning to net investment income, on an APTI basis, fourth quarter net investment income was $3.0 billion, down $331 million or 10% compared to 4Q 2021. Similar to trends throughout 2022, the decrease was due to lower alternative investment income, principally on private equity investments, and lower bond call and tender premiums and mortgage prepayment fees. For the full year, net investment income on an APTI basis was $11.0 billion, down $1.9 billion due to the same trends.For the quarter and the full year, we achieved higher new money reinvestment rates and rate resets from floating rate securities. In 4Q 2022, net investment income on fixed maturities and mortgage and other loans rose $224 million sequentially, with 29 basis points of yield improvement, which was ahead of our 10 to 15 basis point forecast. Since second quarter of 2022, when we began to bend the curve on investment yields, the increase has been 55 basis points. In 4Q 2022, the average new money yield was just over 6% and about 173 basis points above sales and maturities. New money rates were roughly 157 basis points higher in General Insurance and 190 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we repositioned some of the General Insurance portfolio to lock in higher yields, while maintaining similar credit quality and duration.This resulted in a modest capital loss of $57 million, but we expect the portfolio to generate higher net investment income in 2023 as a result. Given current market levels, we expect additional yield uplift of 10 to 15 basis points on the consolidated portfolio in 1Q 2023. Before I head into results for the quarter, I want to note that in the fourth quarter, we eliminated the one-month reporting lag in General Insurance International, which had a $100 million positive impact on our GAAP net income for the quarter. This change did not impact 4Q APTI, which remain on the same reporting basis as the prior year. But in 2023, GI International results will be on a calendar quarter basis and one month different than 2022, which will create some slight timing mismatch in quarterly net premiums written comparisons, but with minimal impact for the full year.Please see Page 25 of the financial supplement for more details. As Peter noted, AIG reported adjusted after-tax income of $1.0 billion or $1.36 per diluted share. General Insurance delivered APTI of $1.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year quarter due to lower investment income, partially offset by a $136 million increase in underwriting income. Prior year development was $151 million favorable in the fourth quarter, up from $44 million of favorable development in 4Q '21. Net favorable amortization for the ADC was $41 million, while North America favorable development was $148 million, and International was $38 million adverse, mostly driven by casualty. Fourth quarter Other Operations adjusted pretax loss of $451 million improved $197 million from last year, despite $23 million of additional expenses related to the Corebridge separation.Annualized adjusted ROCE was 7.5% in 4Q 2022, down from 9.9% in 4Q 2021, principally due to lower alternative investment income. Turning to Life and Retirement, strong sales momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Life and Retirement APTI was $781 million, down from $969 million in 4Q 2021, due to lower investment income on alternatives and other yield enhancements, partially offset by higher base investment income and more favorable mortality. Individual Retirement sales were $3.8 billion, a 16% increase over the prior year quarter with Fixed Annuity sales up 78% and Fixed Index sales up 34%, near record sales for both products. Group Retirement deposits grew 20%, driven by higher out-of-plan Fixed Annuity sales and large plan acquisitions.The Life Insurance business had solid sales with an improving mix of business in the U.S. and continued growth in the UK. In Institutional Markets, premiums and deposits were $1.6 billion, driven by $1.3 billion in pension risk transfer activity. New product margins in L&amp;R were attractive and in excess of long-term targets, supported by higher new money yields, including from Blackstone. After years of spread compression, L&amp;R spreads are expected to improve in 2023. I wanted to make you aware of an update to our LDTI estimate. In the first quarter of 2023, we will adopt a change in accounting principle for LDTI with a transition date of January 1, 2021. Our current estimate is that as of September 30, 2022, the adoption would increase shareholders' equity between $800 million and $1.3 billion and AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity would increase between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion.This increase in the estimate has been predominantly driven by capital market movements during 2021 and 2022. Turning to full year 2022, AIG reported adjusted after-tax income of $3.6 billion or $4.55 per diluted share compared to $4.4 billion or $5.12 per diluted share in 2021. These results include much stronger underwriting profitability in GI, offset by lower alternative investment income, as previously described. General Insurance APTI for the full year 2022 was $4.4 billion, up 2% from 2021 due to the $1 billion increase in underwriting profitability, offset by lower investment income. L&amp;R APTI was $2.7 billion, down from $3.9 billion in 2021, principally because of lower investment income. Other Operations adjusted pretax loss improved about $400 million in 2022 due to lower general operating expenses and higher income on short-term investments.Full year 2022 included additional expenses from the Corebridge separation of $51 million. And in 2023, we expect an incremental cost of $75 million to $100 million in Other Operations' GOE related to the separation. Adjusted book value per share was $73.87 at December 31, 2022, up 7% from year-end 2021. Full year adjusted ROCE was 6.5%, down from 8.6% in 2021, primarily due to lower alternative investment income, which was down $1.8 billion from 2021 or about 340 basis points of ROCE compared to 2021. At year-end, our primary insurance subsidiaries remain above target ranges for statutory capital, with GI's U.S. pool estimated in the range of 4.85 to 4.95 and L&amp;R estimated in the range of 4.10 to 4.20. In addition to the strong financial results, we also executed on multiple capital management priorities in 2022.As Peter described, we established a separate debt capitalization structure for Corebridge and subsequently reduced AIG holding company debt by $9.8 billion. This reduction in AIG debt will lower AIG's holding company interest expense from about $1 billion in 2021 to roughly $500 million in 2023, excluding interest expense on Corebridge issued debt. In 2022, we also returned over $6.1 billion to shareholders with $1 billion of dividends and $5.1 billion of share repurchases, yielding a 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We ended the year with parent liquidity of $3.7 billion. Looking ahead, we remain highly committed and laser-focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE after the deconsolidation of Corebridge. As Peter and Shane have shared previously, achieving this goal is based on sustained and improved underwriting profitability; executing a leaner operating model across AIG; separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management, including reducing AIG common shares to between 600 million and 650 million shares through repurchases, while targeting debt to total capital leverage at the lower end of the 20% to 25% range post deconsolidation.Progress on each of these will increase ROCE, along with additional tailwinds from higher reinvestment yields and alternative returns more consistent with long-term averages. As Peter mentioned, expense reduction remains an important goal. In the following years, we expect to achieve $300 million of additional savings from AIG 200, with the majority earning in through 2023; $300 million of AIG corporate general operating expense moving to Corebridge upon deconsolidation; and additional savings as we transition to a leaner operating model. As a reminder, every $500 million of expense savings equates to one point of ROCE improvement. I will now turn the call back over to Peter.Peter Zaffino: Thank you.

For Disney+, though, the subscriber count dropped from 164.2 million to 161.8 million during the fourth quarter.Story continuesHowever, the drop is attributable to the sluggish performance of its Indian streaming service, Hotstar, which saw a 6.2% decline in subscribers.All in all, though, Disney remains in an excellent position to grow its streaming division, which effectively covers the most lucrative entertainment areas.Netflix (NFLX)Source: vesperstock / Shutterstock.comLast year, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) had a rough outing, losing close to 1.2 million subscribers in the first couple of quarters.It snapped its losing streak in the third, adding 2.4 million new subscribers, before the pièce de résistance in the fourth quarter. It added a whopping 7.66 million paid subscribers in its fourth quarter, blowing past analyst estimates of 4.57 million net subscribers.The streaming pioneer is back in good graces following bold steps taken by its management.Perhaps the most noteworthy of these changes include adding advertisements for the first time and cracking down on password-sharing practices. Both measures will likely contribute significantly to its top-line growth in the upcoming quarters.NFLX stock saw a precipitous drop in price last year, shedding over 50% of its value. In the past six months, though, it is up over 40%, and with an even better showing in the upcoming quarters, expect the stock to continue trading in the green.Spotify Technology (SPOT)Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display.

Moreover, monthly active users shot up to 489 million versus the consensus of 478.5 million.SPOT stock lost momentum over the past few years, with competition from the likes of Apple music. However, Apple music’s 88 million paying subscribers pales compared to Spotify’s massive subscriber base of close to 500 million.If it can continue to grow at 10% to 11% on average over the next seven years, the platform could be on track to reach a mind-boggling 1 billion active users by 2030.Amazon (AMZN)Amazon building at night time with logo light up on buildingSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.comAccording to market research firm Parks Associates, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video overtook Netflix to become the streaming market king in the U.S. for the first time in four years.Prime Video is essentially a value-add for users subscribing to Amazon’s membership program, though it is also available separately. The program has attracted more than 200 million members worldwide.Amazon Prime had just 46 million members in 2015, adding over 154 million members last year.Prime Video’s success is attributable to its vast content library, which grows at a staggering pace each quarter. Amazon’s aggressive acquisitions policy saw MGM studios added to Prime’s massive content library last year.Also, the firm partnered with the National Football League to broadcast the bulk of the Thursday Night Football games. Also, it has ramped up spending on new content, having spent an eye-catching $715 million on its hotly anticipated Lord of the Rings series.FuboTV (FUBO)FuboTV (FUBO) logo on iPhone displaySource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.comFuboTV (NYSE:FUBO) is a leading sports-centric streaming platform that has been an incredible performer over the years.It’s generated almost 450% sales growth on average over the past five years. However, recent results have shown a significant slowdown in revenues and earnings, which led to a major sell-off in its stock last year.Despite a tough operating environment in the fourth quarter, fuboTV was able to churn out 43.5% growth in sales from the prior-year period.The problem lies in its bottom line, which has been consistently in the red from the get-go. In its fourth quarter, it posted a loss per share of 52 cents, which is unlikely to improve given the current testing economic conditions.Nevertheless, FUBO stock could be an interesting contrarian play at current prices, and investors could explore a possible shorting opportunity.Roku (ROKU)Roku logo displayed on tv screen in modern living roomSource: AhmadDanialZulhilmi / Shutterstock.comRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is a popular platform that connects internet-connected television sets.The streaming-device company shed a ton of value last year, with the downturn in advertising hurting its services business. Despite the slowdown in sales from pandemic levels, it is still delivering robust growth in active accounts and streaming hours, a testament to its stellar customer engagement.In its fourth quarter, active accounts increased by 16% to 70 million, while streaming hours rose 23% to 23.9 billion. Despite the substantial hike in its user base, its average revenues per user improved by 2% to $41.68.Additionally, Roku has done remarkably well to shift its business to primarily a high-margin services model, which now represents 80% of its revenue mix. Consequently, its gross margin stands at a spectacular 46.6%, despite the weaknesses in the market.Apple (AAPL)Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center.

Apple TV+ has a global streaming market share of over 6%.According to research from JustWatch, Apple TV+ grew 29% from January 2021 through August last year. On the flip side, Prime Video and Netflix dropped 19% and 14% respectively.It recently delivered a rare quarter where it missed sales targets due to supply chain bottlenecks. However, its services revenue remained a bright spot, bringing in $20.8 billion for the quarter, a 6% bump from the same period last year.Apple states that it has an incredible 935 million paid subscribers across all its services, a mighty accomplishment, to say the least.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the aging demographics and the resulting economic shifts and go directly to 10 Best Countries For A Comfortable Retirement. Retiree Population: By NumbersThe UN estimates suggest that there are 703 million people aged 65 years or older as of 2019, a number that is expected to jump to 1.5 billion by 2050, with every 1 in 6 individuals being a retiree. Further, the number of individuals aged 80 years or older is also expected to increase threefold in the next three decades. The percentage of retirees is expected to be above the global average, at 30%, in countries like Greece, Italy and South Korea, according to OECD. However, 80% of the retirement-age individuals will be living in low to middle income economies by mid century, as per figures from WHO. This is resulting from the decrease in birth rate, which corresponds to the expanding share of women in the workforce, and increasing life expectancy, with chances of surviving at the age of 65 nearly doubling since the late 19th century, according to UN estimates. In 2020, individuals aged 60 years and older outnumbered children younger than 5 years, according to WHO. Many countries are ill-prepared to deal with the economic implications of this trend, and lack the social programs that are needed for the increasing number of retirees. What Are the Economic Implications of the Changing Population Demographics?One of the most obvious implications of an aging population would be the slowdown in the labor-force growth, and consequently, the GDP growth. In fact, the GDP growth in developed economies is already slowing down, in part, due to aging population.Another factor is that the elderly de-risk their portfolios by moving from equity securities to debt securities due to their short-term horizon. As the ratio of equity to debt investment decreases, the stock markets around the world, particularly the growth-based companies, could see a decline. Moreover, aging individuals spend more and save less, which could lead to a rise in real interest rates. Story continuesFurther, working-age people will be paying more in taxes to support the social programs for the elderly and governments will also be borrowing more, as the ratio of workers to consumers (support ratio) falls. Persistent InflationAccording to IMF estimates, the support ratio is expected to fall by 0.26 percent per year between 2015-2050 in the US, 0.40 percent in other developed countries and 0.80 percent in China. Workers are deflationary, since they produce more than they consume. A falling support ratio could mean persistent inflation. Labor shortage is also expected to lead to a rise in real wages. This trend can already be sensed in the manufacturing sector, and especially, in the services sector, since the latter has the dominant share in advanced economies.Japan is often cited as the harbinger for things to come, and it is often pointed out that Japan is deflationary. However, the country has downward pressure on prices due to the Chinese global labor supply in the manufacturing sector. The stark implications can make macroeconomic conditions uneasy for the elderly but many countries have adopted measures to insulate both workers and retirees from the broader macroeconomic problems. How Are Countries Preparing for the Aging Population?Many countries around the world, particularly the ones at the forefront of aging decline, are adopting different means to prepare for the aging demographics. For instance, Singapore has adopted a number of approaches, with one of them being the Central Provident Fund Lifelong Income for the Elderly (CPF LIFE). The scheme is financed through mandatory contributions from citizens to their CPF accounts and is designed to cover the retirement needs of Singaporean citizens for as long as they live after retirement.On the other hand, MediShield Life, a health insurance plan in Singapore, is designed to provide lifelong medical coverage for Singaporean retirees, and is funded through annual premiums.Japan, whose population share of 65 years and older individuals is expected to increase to 38% by 2050, is also one of the most well-prepared to protect its elders from economic shocks. In the year 2000, Japan implemented a comprehensive long-term-care insurance program designed to assist individuals of 65 years of age or older with care facilities like home care and assisted-care facilities, among others, and further improved the program in 2011. Japan is also tapping into its advantages in industrial robotics to compensate for its declining workforce. As of 2021, the Japanese workforce comprises 631 robots for every 10,000 human workers. However, when it comes to the best countries for retirement, no country matches Scandinavian countries, with their high quality social safety nets. On the corporate front, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) are among the most prominent companies that offer the best retirement plans for their employees. For instance, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) pays a 6% match after employees invest 1% of their income in each pay period. Moreover, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) also offers additional match of between 0 and 6% based on employees’ ages and the company’s performance. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), on the other hand, has a 401(k) plan for its non-union employees, instead of a pension plan, with The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) matching 75% contributions on the first 8% of base pay contributions from employees.Finally, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) provides retirement benefits to its employees through its investment fund, in which the company makes a 5% contribution upfront, even if the employee hasn’t made a contribution to the plan. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) also has generous stock purchase incentives for its employees. Best Countries For A Comfortable RetirementPhoto by Max Harlynking on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have defined ‘best countries for a comfortable retirement’ as ones that fare better in material well-being, access to quality healthcare and financial programs, and a clean living environment. In this regard, we have ranked them in a descending order of high retirement-comfort based on the Global Retirement Index of 2022.

Factors to NoteIn the fourth quarter of 2022, PSEG’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures. Such a weather pattern is expected to have contributed to the company’s fourth-quarter revenues, buoyed by the increased electricity demand for cooling purposes.Additionally, some parts of its service territories experienced significant precipitation levels, resulting in wet weather conditions. Moreover, rate-based growth from regulated investments may have positively contributed to its fourth-quarter revenues.However, its service territories were impacted by immense flooding conditions in the fourth quarter, which is likely to have disrupted the smooth flow of electricity to its customers. This may have negatively impacted the company’s fourth-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.18 billion, suggesting a decrease of 28.7% from the year-ago quarter.Immense flooding conditions, as mentioned above, may have caused infrastructural damage for the utility, increasing the company’s operating expenses for restoration and repairing. This is likely to have weighed on its bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. However, lower operating &amp; maintenance expenses and lower depreciation and interest expenses related to the Fossil divestiture may have benefited the bottom line in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 63 cents per share, indicating a decline of 8.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurprisePublic Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurprisePublic Service Enterprise Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated QuoteStory continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PSEG this time.

It is expected to haven risen by 0.4% in January, the biggest gain in five months, while the annual pace is forecast to have slowed to 4.3%.The dollar nudged lower against a basket of major currencies, but was noticeably down against the likes of the so-called commodity currencies, like the Australian dollar , which rose 0.3% and the Canadian dollar, which gained 0.1%.Brent crude futures, which last week shed nearly 4%, rose 0.6% to around $83.48 a barrel, while copper gained 0.6% to trade around $9,037.50 a tonne.

""That's a Fed mission very much unaccomplished.""They said the failure of the S&amp;P 500 to break resistance at 4,200 could unleash a retreat to 3,800 by March 8.The release on Wednesday of the minutes of the Fed's latest meeting may offer more insight into policymakers' deliberations, but could have less impact than usual because the meeting took place after January's bumper payrolls and retail sales reports.In addition, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures index (PCE), lands on Friday. It is expected to haven risen by 0.4% in January, the biggest gain in five months, while the annual pace is forecast to have slowed to 4.3%.The dollar was trading a touch lower against a basket of major currencies, but was noticeably down against the likes of the so-called commodity currencies, like the Australian dollar, which rose 0.4% and the Canadian dollar , which gained 0.1%.Brent crude futures, which last week shed nearly 4%, rose 1% to around $83.75 a barrel, while copper gained 0.5% to trade around %9,033 a tonne. Both are highly sensitive to the health of the Chinese economy, which is still resuming more normal activity after three years of COVID lockdowns.China's offshore yuan enjoyed a bounce, rising 0.2% to around 6.86 to the dollar, after Beijing kept interest rates steady as expected, having already poured liquidity into the banking system in recent days. Chinese equities also rose 1.1%.Earnings season continues this week with major retailers Walmart and Home Depot set to offer updates on the health of the consumer.(Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Christian Schmollinger and Philippa Fletcher)]"

I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home, Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Officer; and Chris Moser, our Head of Competitive Markets and Policy. Starting on Slide 4 with our key messages for today's presentation. We have made significant progress in advancing our strategic priorities in 2022. And while our financial results were lower than expected, our business is well positioned in 2023. Today, we are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance ranges. The Vivint Smart Home acquisition is on track to close by the end of the first quarter.Story continuesToday, we are providing further disclosures around revenue synergies to ensure you have additional tools to properly value the transaction. Finally, the core of NRG is strong, supported by favorable fundamentals. The acquisition of Vivint enhances our ability to achieve our free cash flow before growth per share targets. Now turning to Slide 5 for the financial and operational results of 2022. Beginning with our scorecard for the year, we executed well across our strategic priorities. We delivered our second consecutive year of record safety performance. For me, it always starts and ends with the wellbeing of our people. I want to thank everyone at NRG for staying focused during a challenging year. Our retail group took deliberate actions to manage price volatility and delivered record customer retention and extended the average term of a new customer to 2 years.Also, our bad debt remained below historical levels despite higher inflation and tightening financial conditions. Our plant operations performance was below expectations, primarily impacted by the outage at Paris right before the summer. We are taking additional steps to strengthen our supply and mitigate operational risk during specific conditions. The direct energy integration is nearing completion and on track to deliver our run rate synergy targets in 2023. We executed on our test and learn program during the year, which culminated in the announcement of the Vivint Smart Home acquisition. We also continue our portfolio optimization with 2 gigawatts of coal retirements and asset sales. Finally, on capital allocation, we executed $645 million of share repurchases out of the $1 billion program.We will execute the remaining amount when cash is available and when we have full visibility to achieve our targeted credit metrics. We also increased our dividend by 8%. Since it was reestablished in 2020, we have raised our dividend more than 25% and returned almost $1 billion to shareholders this way. I view our dividend as an integral part of our return on capital policy. Moving to financial results. We delivered $435 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter bringing our 2022 full year result to $1.754 billion, below expectations. For the fourth quarter, we highlighted in our last earnings call that reaching the bottom end of the financial guidance included a little over $100 million of optimization opportunities. Specifically, making our natural gas units available to capture value during periods of high power prices.This opportunity did not materialize as mild weather during the quarter, the power price is much lower than expected. We were also impacted by winter storm Elliott in late December primarily from PJM capacity performance payments, where we risk adjusted downward our bonus payments pending additional information from PJM. Alberto will provide more information on our financial results. Turning to Slide 6, our 2023 outlook. We are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance. We see improving fundamentals in our business, including more stable supply costs driven by lower natural gas prices, less supply chain issues for coal and chemicals, more favorable retail market conditions in the East and economic resilience in our customer base. In the East, we see opportunity for customer growth given rising rates from public utilities, enabling competitive retailers to demonstrate the value of our services to customers on an equal playing field.In Texas, the Public Utility Commission proposed market design improvements that will result in more dispatchable generation and greater reliability of the aircraft grid. I want to commend the Texas Governor's office, legislature, and for taking swift action to enhance grid resilience while ensuring the integrity of the competitive market. Also, retail competition will open in , Texas in the fall, a city with more than 100,000 electric customers. We look forward to having the opportunity to earn and serve customers in that area later this year. In 2023, we will continue executing on our strategic priorities focusing on strengthening our core business while growing ideation products and services, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide.We continue our focus on optimizing our portfolio to better serve our customers. To that effect, we are targeting $500 million in net cash proceeds from asset sales by the end of the year. Having completed our test and learn phase in 2022, we are now focused on the next phase of our strategic road map, growing the business. This includes completing the direct energy integration and increasing the number of customers that purchase multiple products from us. Today, we have sold more than 1 product to 15% of our customers. We are making good progress on cross-selling and will provide additional disclosures as we integrate Vivint. To support this growth, we will continue to strengthen our power supply by expanding our capital-light PPA program for renewables to dispatchable generation at some of our existing sites.Finally, we are on track to close dividend in the first quarter with all regulatory approvals received and no shareholder required. We expect to close financing soon and have begun day one integration efforts. I want to provide additional insights on how Vivint enhances our core energy platform and brings additional capabilities at scale on Slide 7. Vivint is a leader in smart home solutions with nearly 2 million highly engaged customers with an average life of 9 years. Their system brings together automation, security and residential solar under a single proprietary technology and data platform. This business is highly complementary to our core energy offering. We will use their smart home ecosystem to connect all our currently isolated products and services, including green power, batteries, EVs and other products into a seamless experience that is highly engaging and personalized.Energy, Nature, TechnologyPhoto by Andreas Gücklhorn on UnsplashThis engagement will provide tremendous insights into pricing, customer experience, a new solutions that create greater brand loyalty and longer average customer lifetime. As we leverage the smart home ecosystem, we expect to optimize energy demand inside the home, providing valuable services to the wholesale markets. In other words, NRG will be the bridge between the home and energy markets with a unique ability to optimize and monetize value between the two. Vivint will also complement our existing energy product offerings and sales channels by adding home automation, security and residential solar at scale including a proven acquisition engine with a solid track record of growth and nearly 2 million customers. On the right-hand side of the slide is the virtuous cycle that we have discussed in the past.By leveraging our existing platform, we can access meaningful cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, resulting in a better experience for our customers. All of this translates into a deeper understanding of how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core products and then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business. Now I want to disclose the value of opportunities that this combination represents on Slide 8. We have identified 3 main areas of value, growing and optimizing our network of customers, leveraging the platform to achieve cost synergies and improving the value of our core energy customers. With respect to the growth opportunity, we are targeting $300 million of incremental free cash flow before growth by 2025.We are encouraged by the preliminary work we have done on both sets of customers and look forward to fully optimize once the transaction closes. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, there is some overlap in our core energy markets, but it's relatively small. This is important because Vivint already has teams ready to be deployed in our core energy markets and because the addressable market opportunity for new customers will be even greater. We expect to achieve this growth target in several ways as we target Tier 1 customers which we define as single-family homeowners with high credit scores within select urban areas. We will focus on 2 immediate and actionable opportunities. One, cross-selling existing products into our combined customer network of 7.5 million customers; two, selling bundle offers to new customers outside of our network representing 15 million potential households.In addition, we will grow dividends organically in line with historical levels. These opportunities will be enhanced by optimizing our combined sales channels and best practices, leveraging the strength of both NRG and Vivint. The capital required to achieve this growth is expected to range $500 million to $600 million over the next 3 years. For gross synergies, we have identified $100 million to be achieved by 2025, primarily from combining 2 public companies. For these, we expect $160 million of onetime cost to achieve. Finally, on our existing core energy customers, cross-selling means we can have direct access to our customers in the East and the opportunity to expand margin and extend customer lifetime value. In total, we see a $400 million opportunity by '25 and a larger opportunity beyond given the size of the smart home addressable market.I am confident in our ability to deliver these targets as we have a strong history of integration and synergy achievement. Just to remind you, since 2016, we have achieved significant value on integration synergies, cost reductions and enhancement programs. This effort will be led by the same team as the transformation plan and direct energy integration. I look forward to providing you a more comprehensive update later this year during our Investor Day. Now turning to Slide 9. We want to give you an update on our pro forma outlook and how the dividend transaction supports our growth targets. On the left-hand side of the slide is a free cash flow before growth pro forma walk from 2023 to 2025, including the expected growth contribution from Vivint that we just discussed on the previous slide.This illustrates the earnings power of the company and will be further unpacked once the transaction is closed. On the right-hand side of the slide is the expected capital allocation through 2025. As you can see, the combined platform provides the financial flexibility to have a balanced approach between growth and return of capital while maintaining a strong balance sheet. The acquisition of Vivint and more specifically, the growth opportunity that it represents will better support our per share growth targets while materially high-grading our earnings quality and customer lifetime value. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review.Alberto Fornaro: Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of 2022 results. During our third quarter call, we stated that higher profitability in the fourth quarter would enable us to deliver an adjusted EBITDA at the bottom of our 2022 full year guidance range. To realize this, we mentioned that the higher profitability was partly related to insurance proceeds for Limestone Unit 1 and Paris , additional synergies and other cost reductions and the remaining from the opportunity to generate additional gross margin from the planned utilization of our gas fleet. Our forecasting process is based on forward market curves and at the time, the forward curves included higher power prices for the fourth quarter which would make the planned utilization of the gas fleet economical.Unfortunately, prices in the fourth quarter fell significantly below short of expectation. On peak prices in Texas were 45% below expectation, resulting in lower profitability from our generation fleet. Near the end of December, winter storm Elliott brought sharp reduction in temperature for a short time, December 20-24. During the storm, flood surge was faster and significantly higher at the upper level of the expected range in both ERCOT and PJM for several hours. This drove spikes in power prices. Our gas generation fleet in Texas, which was largely unutilized in the fourth quarter was called in to action. Given the significant gap between actual and expected load, the fleet was unable to completely match the additional demand. As a result, we portrayed additional power in the market at higher prices.In the East, higher load led to a PJM reliability core for our units without any notice. Several of our larger units were reserved started the event and have longer startup times, which led to capacity performance, a negative impact given the lack of notice. The lower-than-expected prices at the beginning of the quarter coupled with the impact of the winter storm drove unfavorable variances to our EBITDA expectation. The fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $435 million was below our implied guidance by $196 million. We estimated that the lower prices experienced for most of Q4 reduced the expected contribution of our gas generation by approximately $115 million. We also estimated a winter storm Elliott caused approximately $80 million in negative impact.This was primarily a result of the net impact of capacity performance in PJM as well as increased power purchases in ERCOT that were partially offset by an expected capacity performance bonds for the plant. When we look at the full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.754 billion, fell short of the midpoint of guidance at the beginning of 2022 by $346 million. There were 2 main drivers that impacted this result. First, the extended outage at Parish with $220 million of lost margin that was partially offset by business interruption proceeds of $52 million; and second, the estimated $80 million impact of winter storm Elliott. There was also an incremental $44 million of pension expenses resulting from reduced prices of financial assets in the second half of the year and some increased O&amp;M expenses.Additional drivers include $15 million of reduced earnings for the divestiture of Watson and $16 million of growth expenses. In 2022, free cash flow before growth came in at $568 million, with the deficit to our third quarter guidance driven primarily by the shortfall in EBITDA and two working capital drivers. First, that the insurance proceeds for Parish and Limestone that were forecasted for 2022 were accrued in the fourth quarter but received in January 2023, resulting at the end of the year in a $100 million increase in receivables. Second working capital as an additional negative impact due to falling gas prices in the quarter which more rapidly impacted the account payables than the account received. Turning our attention to 2023, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth.Before we review the 2023 cash available for allocation, I would like to provide updates with winter storm Yuri and direct energy synergies. The 2021 net impact of winter storm Yuri was $380 million. During 2022, we were able to increase mitigant proceeds and reduced the total net cost to approximately $259 million. For future years, there will still be some cost recoveries associated with Yuri, but within the amount to be immaterial, and we will no longer update to these fees. For direct energy synergies, we achieved a total of $84 million of additional synergies in 2022 with the related integration cost of $74 million bringing the total synergy achieved from the acquisition to $259 million. We are confident that we can achieve the remaining synergies, which are related to specific projects that will be completed in 2023.Therefore, we will no longer provide quarterly updates on our direct energy synergy process -- progress, but we will provide a final summary at year-end. Now turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on our 2023 capital allocation. Moving left to right, with blue shading indicating updates. Excess cash from 2022 is equal to $40 million at year-end, plus $209 million in proceeds from the sales of Astoria which totals $249 million in the bottom left. Next, for Vivint, we continue to utilize its 2022 pro forma full year figures provided in our December call. Full year free cash flow below growth of $1.73 billion includes energy stand-alone guidance of $1.62 billion plus pro forma $110 million for EBIT. This includes the expected impact from debt financing.In addition, we included a $300 million of cash available from Vivint. Next , we are targeting $500 million of leverage neutral net inflow from asset sales. The next investments are higher by $29 million following early realization of previously included winter storm Yuri in 2022. Now moving to the far right bar, we expect a total of $434 million available for future allocation. This will fund the remaining share repurchase program upon full visibility of the achieving of our 2023 target credit metrics, which are detailed on the next slide. Now quickly turning to Slide 13. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet. This slide has not changed since our last update. We are focused on achieving 2023 target credit metrics and investment grade credit metrics by late 2025 to 2026 through both debt reduction and growth.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mauricio.Mauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Alberto. On Slide 15, I want to briefly outline our 2023 priorities and expectations. First and foremost is delivering on our core energy business goals. We will continue to strengthen our integrated platform and further optimize our portfolio. Second, we are focused on closing the dividend acquisition, integrating the business and delivering on our synergy commitments. Finally, we will stay disciplined on our capital allocation plan as we execute on our strategic priorities. I am excited about this next phase of our evolution and look forward to providing you a comprehensive update at our Investor Day later this year. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG.

Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 2.2% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Before making this announcement, NextEra Energy was paying out a fairly large proportion of earnings, and it wasn't generating positive free cash flows either. We think that this practice can make the dividend quite risky in the future.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 75.0%. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 53% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.historic-dividendNextEra Energy Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.60 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.70. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, things aren't all that rosy. NextEra Energy has seen earnings per share falling at 6.2% per year over the last five years. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.NextEra Energy's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think NextEra Energy will make a great income stock. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

""I decided working in the life sciences like at Medtronic would help me do that.""He came to Medtronic shortly after Yaya's death. Now a senior legal director, Garber founded the Yaya Foundation with his wife - and, just as he hoped, Medtronic played a role.That's because he's surrounded by expertise, he said, citing a random conversation at a team dinner that led to a milestone in his foundation's research.""There are just thought partners everywhere you look who have amazing knowledge and are willing to help,"" he said.

""It's easy to lose our sense of purpose when we stop talking about patients.""Growing impactThe Yaya Foundation provides education and emotional support for families by creating videos with care guidelines, translating journal articles into layperson speak and other languages, and hosting bi-monthly support calls.But it's also on a mission to accelerate therapeutic discovery for 4H Leukodystrophy.The Yaya Foundation was recognized as a best-in-class rare disease patient org as a recipient of a prestigious Rare As One grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Story continuesThrough that funding, the organization executed a collaborative research model that brings together the best and brightest researchers in the field.In just three short years, it has launched a data collection program in collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, hosted several family and scientific meetings, and has played a role in several important research breakthroughs, including the creation of a complex disease model that will facilitate advanced research in gene therapy.Matched Giving brings dream to lifeIt's not just the mindshare at Medtronic that helps fuel Garber: The Medtronic Foundation's employee Matched Giving program was crucial to getting the Yaya Foundation off the ground.""We could have been just a mom and a dad saying, ‘hey we want to make the world better,' but the match made us a mom and a dad with funding,"" Garber said. ""We had enough seed funding to get the attention of our stakeholders.""Since then, many employees chose to donate to the Yaya Foundation, and the Medtronic Foundation matched every donation. With the support of Medtronic colleagues and supporters across the globe, the Yaya Foundation has raised over a million and a half dollars to provide support for families and accelerate discovery of 4HL Leukodystrophy therapies.""It feels good to bring hope to families like ours,"" he said. ""In short, we're trying to change the world for people like Yaya.""The work is meaningful to Garber in more ways than one.""Grief creates a lot of energy,"" he said.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the aging demographics and the resulting economic shifts and go directly to 10 Best Countries For A Comfortable Retirement. Retiree Population: By NumbersThe UN estimates suggest that there are 703 million people aged 65 years or older as of 2019, a number that is expected to jump to 1.5 billion by 2050, with every 1 in 6 individuals being a retiree. Further, the number of individuals aged 80 years or older is also expected to increase threefold in the next three decades. The percentage of retirees is expected to be above the global average, at 30%, in countries like Greece, Italy and South Korea, according to OECD. However, 80% of the retirement-age individuals will be living in low to middle income economies by mid century, as per figures from WHO. This is resulting from the decrease in birth rate, which corresponds to the expanding share of women in the workforce, and increasing life expectancy, with chances of surviving at the age of 65 nearly doubling since the late 19th century, according to UN estimates. In 2020, individuals aged 60 years and older outnumbered children younger than 5 years, according to WHO. Many countries are ill-prepared to deal with the economic implications of this trend, and lack the social programs that are needed for the increasing number of retirees. What Are the Economic Implications of the Changing Population Demographics?One of the most obvious implications of an aging population would be the slowdown in the labor-force growth, and consequently, the GDP growth. In fact, the GDP growth in developed economies is already slowing down, in part, due to aging population.Another factor is that the elderly de-risk their portfolios by moving from equity securities to debt securities due to their short-term horizon. As the ratio of equity to debt investment decreases, the stock markets around the world, particularly the growth-based companies, could see a decline. Moreover, aging individuals spend more and save less, which could lead to a rise in real interest rates. Story continuesFurther, working-age people will be paying more in taxes to support the social programs for the elderly and governments will also be borrowing more, as the ratio of workers to consumers (support ratio) falls. Persistent InflationAccording to IMF estimates, the support ratio is expected to fall by 0.26 percent per year between 2015-2050 in the US, 0.40 percent in other developed countries and 0.80 percent in China. Workers are deflationary, since they produce more than they consume. A falling support ratio could mean persistent inflation. Labor shortage is also expected to lead to a rise in real wages. This trend can already be sensed in the manufacturing sector, and especially, in the services sector, since the latter has the dominant share in advanced economies.Japan is often cited as the harbinger for things to come, and it is often pointed out that Japan is deflationary. However, the country has downward pressure on prices due to the Chinese global labor supply in the manufacturing sector. The stark implications can make macroeconomic conditions uneasy for the elderly but many countries have adopted measures to insulate both workers and retirees from the broader macroeconomic problems. How Are Countries Preparing for the Aging Population?Many countries around the world, particularly the ones at the forefront of aging decline, are adopting different means to prepare for the aging demographics. For instance, Singapore has adopted a number of approaches, with one of them being the Central Provident Fund Lifelong Income for the Elderly (CPF LIFE). The scheme is financed through mandatory contributions from citizens to their CPF accounts and is designed to cover the retirement needs of Singaporean citizens for as long as they live after retirement.On the other hand, MediShield Life, a health insurance plan in Singapore, is designed to provide lifelong medical coverage for Singaporean retirees, and is funded through annual premiums.Japan, whose population share of 65 years and older individuals is expected to increase to 38% by 2050, is also one of the most well-prepared to protect its elders from economic shocks. In the year 2000, Japan implemented a comprehensive long-term-care insurance program designed to assist individuals of 65 years of age or older with care facilities like home care and assisted-care facilities, among others, and further improved the program in 2011. Japan is also tapping into its advantages in industrial robotics to compensate for its declining workforce. As of 2021, the Japanese workforce comprises 631 robots for every 10,000 human workers. However, when it comes to the best countries for retirement, no country matches Scandinavian countries, with their high quality social safety nets. On the corporate front, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) are among the most prominent companies that offer the best retirement plans for their employees. For instance, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) pays a 6% match after employees invest 1% of their income in each pay period. Moreover, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) also offers additional match of between 0 and 6% based on employees’ ages and the company’s performance. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), on the other hand, has a 401(k) plan for its non-union employees, instead of a pension plan, with The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) matching 75% contributions on the first 8% of base pay contributions from employees.Finally, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) provides retirement benefits to its employees through its investment fund, in which the company makes a 5% contribution upfront, even if the employee hasn’t made a contribution to the plan.

66,0fdb4f33-f702-3b34-9a5d-c89e946abd93,NOC,2023-02-20,Be Sure To Check Out Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-northrop-grumman-corporation-100629855.html,1676887589,STORY,['NOC'],"[Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next three days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Northrop Grumman's shares before the 24th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.73 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$6.92 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Northrop Grumman has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current stock price of $470.63. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Northrop Grumman has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 21% of its income after tax. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Northrop Grumman generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 72% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Northrop Grumman's earnings per share have been growing at 14% a year for the past five years. Northrop Grumman is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Northrop Grumman has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Northrop Grumman for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Northrop Grumman paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. There's a lot to like about Northrop Grumman, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while Northrop Grumman has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 3 warning signs for Northrop Grumman (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Promising Blockchain Stocks According to Analysts.The blockchain industry is a rapidly growing sector of the technology market that is revolutionizing the way businesses and individuals interact with each other. Blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger system, is a form of digital ledger technology that records and stores information in a secure and immutable way. This technology is used to create digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, and to facilitate smart contracts, which are self-executing digital agreements.Some Use Cases of Blockchain TechnologyWhile blockchain and crypto are often used interchangeably, cryptocurrency is just a popular use case of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology has many other use cases. Blockchains can be used to create secure identities and records, such as digital passports, birth certificates, and medical records. Blockchains can also be used in financial services to facilitate transactions, streamline accounting and regulatory compliance, and to protect data from malicious actors. Moreover, blockchain technology can also be used in supply chain management to track the origin and quality of products. Overall, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we store and transfer data. Its use cases are vast and varied, and its potential is only just beginning to be explored.Blockchain Industry Outlook and Future Growth ProspectsOn February 13 Algorand Foundation CEO, Staci Warden, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where she discussed her outlook for blockchain technology and the value proposition it presents for managing personal finance as well as cater to other diverse use cases. According to Staci Warden, blockchain technology is expected to revolutionize 5 industries as it matures. First and foremost, blockchain technology is revolutionizing the smart payments industry. Staci Warden gave an example about how if two people living in different countries have to share media, they can do it via WhatsApp instantaneously. However, if two people living in different countries had to make a financial transaction, then ""it has to travel through the correspondent banking system of the U.S., clear at the Fed, somebody takes in between 6% and 8% off the top and it might get there 4 days later"". According to Staci Warden, ""the fundamental value proposition of blockchain is actually that that currency doesn't move at all, it's that it's one ledger"" and so it allows for a transaction between two individuals living in different countries to ""happen immediately"".Story continuesWarden pointed out that blockchain technology can be leveraged for many other use cases including identity verification, supply chain management, creating a more efficient and transparent democratic governance system, and can also be used for creating digital tokens of real-world assets to increase their liquidity.The blockchain industry has seen tremendous growth in recent years, with many companies and organizations adopting this technology as a way to securely store data and facilitate transactions. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global blockchain technology industry was worth $10.02 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 87.7% from 2023 to 2030. The blockchain industry is expected to reach a value of $17.46 billion by the end of 2023, and is projected to grow to $1.43 trillion by 2030.The blockchain industry is still in its early stages, and there is a lot of potential for growth in the years to come. For early-stage investors, blockchain stocks can become potential multi-baggers as the sector continues to mature.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) suffered with the slowdown in e-commerce, yet still will have outgrown e-commerce when we see final 2022 numbers. Much like Amazon, PayPal invested far too aggressively on the expectation of sustained elevated growth rates in e-commerce and unfortunately, unlike with Amazon, PayPal’s investment was on ancillary product excursions from which the company is already retrenching. The good news is that with this retrenchment, the company should once again return to its recipe of healthy top line growth and incremental margin leverage, but rather than grow back into their old margin structure they will have to cost-cut their way there.”8.

70,7ae7fbe3-0574-3c90-a51c-30b3f508f4e9,PYPL,2023-02-20,7 Stocks to Buy as Employees Prepare to Quit En Masse,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-employees-prepare-193630200.html,1676576190,STORY,"['RHI', 'MSFT', 'PYPL', 'UPWK', 'DASH']","[Although gainful employment may seemingly represent a source of gratitude during a season of layoffs, that might not be the case right now, thus cynically bolstering the narrative for specific stocks to buy. According to a late-Jan. 2023 report by Chicago-based staffing firm LaSalle Network, its survey found that 85% of U.S. workers may consider leaving their jobs in the next six months.If so, that would likely impose a radical paradigm shift in the labor force. To be clear, it’s not that 85% of workers already have their foot out the door. However, the magnitude of dissatisfaction should startle onlookers. For instance, the survey found that “39% of managers are dissatisfied with their roles, compared to only 29% of staff-level employees.” Therefore, a possible quitting en masse could cut a diverse range of career trajectories.Again, it’s unlikely that so many workers would just up and quit, particularly during a rough economic cycle. Nevertheless, investors should prepare for some discontent materializing in the form of resignation letters. Below are the stocks to buy to bank on this trend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMSFTMicrosoft$265.58PYPLPayPal$78.15RHIRobert Half$83.30DASHDoorDash$67.73UPWKUpwork$12.41ROVRRover Group$4.02PIXYShiftPixy$8.10Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fits in well with practically any subject. And so it is with rising discontent in the workplace. Should people leave their current jobs, it’s likely more than a few will try their luck with the gig economy. And why not?With Industry Research analysts pegging the segment to command a valuation of $873 billion by 2027, in some ways, it’s better to start early. The dirty secret about gig work is that it’s a competitive field. Further, enterprises have a good idea with whom they wish to collaborate. Thus, it’s probably better to get a foot in the door and establish a strong reputation early.Story continuesShould this framework materialize, Microsoft practically enjoys a natural monopoly with its Software as a Service. No matter how many times other competitors enter the field, Microsoft utterly dominates office applications like Word or Excel. Don’t expect this to change anytime soon. Further, Wall Street digs MSFT, pegging it a strong buy. Thus, I wouldn’t fight the tape – it’s one of the stocks to buy.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAn indirect player in the gig economy, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) nevertheless strikes an incredibly relevant tone. Primarily a digital payments processor, the underlying platform provides a convenient and intuitive business app for independent professionals. From receiving payment for goods or services delivered to its automated record-keeping system, PayPal is a blessing for gig workers.To be fair, the competition presents a concern, particularly in the broader financial technology ecosystem. Nevertheless, PayPal brings much trust to the table, having been created in December 1998. Significantly, it’s not some fly-by-night operation, which gives confidence to those that are just starting out on the road to business independence.According to Gurufocus.com, PYPL rates as significantly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value. On an objective basis, PayPal enjoys strong growth metrics, especially revenue growth of 16.7% in the past three years. This ranks better than nearly 78% of the competition. As well, Wall Street analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $101.77, implying nearly 31% upside potential.Robert Half (RHI)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockWith more than a few workers expressing discontent, the case for Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) suddenly looks quite intriguing. Now, let me first acknowledge that RHI does carry risks regarding stocks to buy on shifting work paradigms. After all, RHI stumbled more than 32% during the trailing year. And for the fourth quarter of 2022, Robert Half’s revenue tally of $1.73 billion fell 2.4% on a year-over-year basis.However, not everyone who’s discontent in the office will join the gig economy. From personal experience, it’s better to have a job and inch your way into the arena. Going full bore into the gig lifestyle can create needless headaches and anxieties. Instead, the dissatisfied may simply want a change of scenery. For that, Robert Half provides an intriguing profile.Also, the recent surge in mass layoffs may cynically favor RHI stock. Essentially, beggars can’t be choosers anymore with enterprises shaving headcount. Thus, when a reasonable opportunity – not a perfect one – comes up, more people may be inclined to take it.DoorDash (DASH)Close up of Doordash (DASH) logo and symbol displayed at the entrance to one of their officesSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of mass layoffs, it might be a good time to have a loose discussion about DoorDash (NYSE:DASH). By loose, I simply mean that the food-delivery service represents a higher-risk, higher-reward opportunity. Therefore, it’s not one of the stocks to buy with mortgage money. Rather, it’s an investment with morning coffee shop money, if that makes sense.Fundamentally, the rise of discontent in the workplace should make DoorDash progressively more intriguing. Even without the extraordinary pressures of the pandemic, corporate burnout represented a significant dilemma. For many folks, the allure of a paycheck just isn’t enough to work the daily grind in the cubicle. Rather, they may value more their quality of time on this Earth.Now, I’m not suggesting that DoorDash represents the holy grail of the gig economy – it’s not. However, I’ve seen far too many diverse groups of people work food-delivery jobs to recognize that at least some do it because they hate the suit-and-tie paradigm.For full disclosure, Dash continues to post net losses, which isn’t encouraging. However, it enjoys stout stability in the balance sheet, making it an interesting idea for stocks to buy.Upwork (UPWK)The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.Source: Funstock / Shutterstock.comGiven that so many managers seem dissatisfied with their jobs, many people seeking an exit from the rat race may quit corporate America altogether, instead joining the ranks of the gig economy. After all, people in middle management likely got to their position based on both experience and acumen. Therefore, they might put their skills to the test in the freelancer market, which may bode well for Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK).Connecting enterprises that need short-term roles filled with independent professionals that can fill them, Upwork represents a direct player in the gig economy. Coincidentally, shares have been soaring this year, just as worker dissatisfaction is apparently rising. Since the January opener, UPWK gained over 29% of its equity value.To be fair, UPWK also presents a wildly risky profile among stocks to buy. In the past 365 days, shares fell 45%. Also, the financials leave much to be desired, particularly in the revenue growth and earnings department. Still, Wall Street loves UPWK, pegging it a consensus strong buy. Also, analysts’ average price target of $17.67 implies upside potential of nearly 27%.Rover Group (ROVR)A terrier lies on a dog bed with a cone on.Source: ShutterstockFor those seeking a fun, if not unorthodox platform for the gig economy, Rover Group (NASDAQ:ROVR) might fit the bill. Similar to Upwork above, Rover represents a direct player among stocks to buy for the gig economy. But rather than connecting businesses with independent professionals, Rover connects pet (dog) owners with pet service providers. These services may include dog-walking sessions or boarding.Fundamentally, Rover checks so many boxes. For one thing, several managers and rank-and-file worker bees report job dissatisfaction. Part of that stems from working with silly humans and their drama. Dogs? They’re four-legged manifestations of unconditional love.In terms of demand, the narrative for Rover should only accelerate from here on out. True, the pandemic forced many people indoors, allowing them to care for their pets. But guess what? Some of the biggest enterprises have quashed remote operations. And that means people will now have to find some means to care for their pets while they’re away nine to five. To be fair, it’s a risky narrative because of the yet-to-be-proven financials. Still, it’s such a great narrative that it might be worth a speculative bet.ShiftPixy (PIXY)ShiftPixy (PIXY) logo displayed on a smartphone screen with company website on computer monitor behind smartphoneSource: shutterstock.com/T. SchneiderBefore discussing ShiftPixy (NASDAQ:PIXY), the narrative requires a caveat or five. Primarily, it’s an extremely risky “investment,” so much so that I hesitated to include it on this list of “stocks to buy.” During the trailing year, PIXY suffered a devastating blow, hemorrhaging 92% of its equity value. It doesn’t take rocket science to realize that companies don’t lose that much value without a reason.So, why bother mentioning ShiftPixy at all? Fundamentally, I go back to the narrative. The company specializes in a next-generation human resources platform that connects employers and employees. Further, the platform has significant implications for the gig economy in reducing the impact of worker turnover. Essentially, ShiftPixy keeps enterprises’ schedules stacked with a live, on-demand workforce.With several people questioning the nature of work in the post-pandemic paradigm, a reliable schedule has never been more important for companies. Therefore, PIXY could rise above the muck, despite earlier troubles.However, this doesn’t mean you should ignore the risks so only wager with money you can afford to lose.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

However, you can actually get exposure to machine learning through IBM stock, along with consistent dividend payouts. Plus, IBM’s annual revenue growth should put some of the skeptics’ doubts to rest.IBM gets a “B” rating instead of an “A” because let’s be honest, other technology companies have overtaken IBM during the past 20 years. However, IBM is staying relevant by venturing into notable tech niches, including AI.So, don’t assume that IBM is a dinosaur in the 2020s. Holding a few IBM shares means you’ll get quarterly cash payments, and you’ll be invested in an established company that’s still not afraid to innovate.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMIBM $135.06IBM Stock Declines Despite Solid ResultsOn Jan. 25, IBM stock fell in post-session trading after the company reported its largest annual sales increase in over a decade. This seems like an irrational response from the market, as IBM had a solid 2022 despite high inflation.IBM’s full-year 2022 revenue of $60.5 billion represents a year-over-year increase of 6%. That’s the biggest annualized sales increase, percentage-wise, for IBM since 2011.Furthermore, IBM reported 2022 hybrid cloud revenue of $22.4 billion, up 11%. This just goes to show that IBM has, in some respects at least, demonstrated success in its transformation.Perhaps investors sold their IBM shares because the company announced that it was laying off 1% to 1.5% of its employees.Yet, IBM certainly isn’t the only tech company implementing layoffs. In any case, the headcount reduction should help IBM reduce its expenditures.You Can Get AI Exposure with IBM StockMaybe you’re amazed to discover that IBM is growing its hybrid cloud business revenue. Now, here’s another fact that might surprise you.Story continuesIBM is involved in machine learning, and the company is collaborating with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on an AI-focused project.Specifically, IBM will collaborate with NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center to use IBM’s AI technology “to discover new insights in NASA’s massive trove of Earth and geospatial science data.”Moreover, “AI foundation model technology” will be applied to “NASA’s Earth-observing satellite data for the first time.”Suffice it to say, it’s a huge vote of confidence as NASA taps IBM to lend a hand with its AI technology.This isn’t only about IBM finding new sources of revenue. It’s also about IBM shaking off its reputation as a tech left behind. Now, IBM has an opportunity to re-establish itself as a front-runner in future-facing niche markets, including AI.What You Can Do NowIf you’d like to invest in a famous tech business that’s making waves in machine learning, consider IBM. The company respects its loyal investors, as IBM pays a generous annual dividend yield of around 5%.Thus, you can get regular cash payouts and hold a stake in a revenue-growing business with shares of IBM stock. And, you’d be invested in the AI revolution with a stock pick that many financial traders are currently missing out on.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

To be sure, the segment carries significant risks. From both the technical aspect of covering myriad variables to the legal framework, autonomous mobility represents a pioneering endeavor. Still, research and development continue, aiming to crack the self-driving code.Fundamentally, the case for autonomous vehicles stocks centers on the potential numbers. According to Grand View Research, global demand for artificial intelligence-powered vehicles stood at around 51,600 units in 2021. From 2022 to 2030, experts project that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 53.6%.At the culmination of the forecasted period, demand should reach nearly 3.2 million units. In other words, this segment will likely continue expanding stratospherically. Therefore, it might pay for investors to consider the below autonomous vehicles stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGOOG GOOGLAlphabet$96.85NVDANvidia$224.68TSLATesla$210.78GMGeneral Motors$43.44MVISMicrovision$2.92OUSTOuster$1.44INVZInnoviz Technologies$4.56Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAlthough best known for its domination of internet search and overall digital utility via its Google ecosystem, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) more than handles its own in terms of innovative solutions. In particular, Alphabet invested considerable funds into autonomous vehicles via its Waymo self-driving car project.According to a UBS analyst, Waymo will own 60% of the self-driving market by 2030. Under this framework, in total, the autonomous mobility sector may reach a valuation of up to $2.8 trillion. If so, Alphabet may be able to achieve a somewhat similar dominance to what it delivered with Google search.Story continuesFinancially, GOOG presents an attractive proposition for autonomous vehicles stocks to buy. According to Gurufocus.com, GOOG rates as significantly undervalued based on its discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. Specifically, the investment resource calculates the fair value at $156.60 with a margin of safety of 38%. Turning to Wall Street, Alphabet enjoys a unanimous strong buy assessment. With a more than 28% upside potential, GOOG easily ranks among the top autonomous vehicles stocks.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comGarnering popularity for its graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates several segments of the tech hardware space. Over the years, the company has taken a significant interest in autonomous mobility. Through its AI and machine learning developments, Nvidia demonstrates that true self-driving technology may only be a few years away.Specifically, Nvidia works on several initiatives, including DRIVE Concierge, which enables autonomous mobility along with providing a digital assistant platform. As well, it works on advanced software to imbue its platform with real-time AI inference.Another factor bolstering the case for NVDA centers on its financials. For starters, the company commands a strong balance sheet, evidenced by its Altman Z-Score of 19.74, which reflects extremely low bankruptcy risk. Also, it features double-digit revenue growth and net margins, providing confidence for prospective investors. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg NVDA as a consensus moderate buy. For a decently reliable take on autonomous vehicles stocks, NVDA deserves consideration.Tesla (TSLA)Interior of the Tesla Model 3Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comWhile Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) hangs most of its reputation on effectively pioneering electric vehicles in the modern era, it’s also a significant player among autonomous vehicles stocks. According to the company’s website, “Tesla cars come standard with advanced hardware capable of providing Autopilot features, and full self-driving capabilities—through software updates designed to improve functionality over time.”Personally, I was skeptical about any kind of self-driving protocol. However, a friend of mine let me drive his Tesla and I must say that I’m incredibly impressed with the integrated AI. Admittedly, I’m not sure if I trust a machine completely with my life. Nevertheless, the tech is astounding.Further, speculators may be eyeballing TSLA for its relative discount. While shares nearly doubled so far this year, in the past 365 days, TSLA gave up more than 30% of equity value. As well, its financials look attractive. Not surprisingly, it features bonkers revenue growth and an outstanding trailing-year net margin of 15.45%. Currently, Wall Street analysts peg TSLA as a consensus moderate buy. For proven capabilities, investors should consider TSLA as one of the promising autonomous vehicles stocks.General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comOnce a struggling brand following the disaster of the Great Recession, General Motors (NYSE:GM) now stands as one of the most promising automakers. Better yet, it’s made significant inroads as a candidate for top-tier autonomous vehicles stocks.Per its website, GM not only pivoted strongly to the electrification of mobility, it also invested heavily in autonomous mobility solutions. The stated purpose of this initiative is to promote better accessibility, safer roads and less traffic.As I’ve stated before, a particularly attractive element about GM is that it doesn’t ignore its customers’ desires. Therefore, while it works to electrify its most iconic brands – such as the Hummer – it hasn’t given up on its combustion-powered heritage. Indeed, the eighth-generation Corvette confirms that GM will still give automotive enthusiasts a reason to cheer. Financially, presents an enticing profile. At the moment, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7. As a discount to earnings, General Motors ranks better than nearly 79% of the competition. Also, analysts peg GM as a consensus moderate buy, with a price target implying nearly 14% upside potential.MicroVision (MVIS)An image of an autonomous smart car driving, sensing other vehicles in the roadSource: Andrey Suslov/ShutterstockFor the next three autonomous vehicles stocks, we’re going to discuss the most speculative market ideas, beginning with MicroVision (NASDAQ:MVIS). A technology firm specializing in laser scanning, its innovations carry applications for projection, 3D sensing, and image capture. The company enjoys organic relevancies in light detection and ranging (lidar) systems, which enable self-driving cars to “visualize” their environment.According to its website, MicroVision’s lidar system benefits from the key advantages of a dynamic field of view (enabling object targeting at short and long ranges simultaneously) and the accurate detection of smaller objects from longer distances. As well, the system features low latency for improved reaction times and lower costs.To be fair, what’s not an advantage is the company’s poor financials. Other than its balance sheet – which admittedly features a strong cash balance relative to debt – the fiscal stats ping poorly. We’re talking negative growth on a per-share basis and profit margins well below breakeven. That said, speculators believe MVIS to be one of the promising autonomous vehicles stocks, with shares up 21% this year. I’ll let you decide if it’s worth the risk.Ouster (OUST)Image of the Cockpit of futuristic autonomous carSource: ShutterstockA lidar specialist, Ouster (NYSE:OUST) builds high-resolution, digital 3D lidar sensors for use in various platforms. They include autonomous vehicles, industrial, robotics, drones, mapping, defense, and security systems. Further, its sensors produce images from ambient infrared, with software that enables a vehicle’s sensing and mapping functions.Recently, Ouster generated massive headlines when it completed its acquisition of Velodyne, with management calling it a “merger of equals.” Effectively, the combined entities now form a lidar powerhouse. Per CNBC, the deal will see the enterprise command “…more than 850 current customers, a deep portfolio of patents, and about $315 million in cash on hand, based on year-end figures.”To be sure, the cash will be critical. As with MicroVision above, Ouster remains a deeply unprofitable enterprise. In addition, forward motion will likely require intense capitalization, making a robust war chest incredibly vital. Currently, Wall Street has a narrow consensus view of a moderate buy for OUST. Analysts’ average price target stands at $1.70, implying an 11% growth potential.Innoviz Technologies (INVZ)A young woman reads a book while behind the wheel of a self-driving car.Source: ShutterstockRounding out this list of autonomous vehicles stocks is Innoviz Technologies (NASDAQ:INVZ). Based in Israel, Innoviz acts as a supplier of high-performance lidar semiconductor sensors and perception software that provide vision solutions for various sectors. These include automotive, drones, robotics, and mapping among others.One of the main advantages that Innoviz carries is its latest-generation InnovizTwo lidar system. According to its website, the InnovizTwo performs 30 times better than previous-generation lidar systems. In addition, the cost sits 70% cheaper, dramatically improving accessibility to the game-changing invention.Coincidence or not, INVZ has performed very well compared to speculative autonomous vehicles stocks. Yes, it’s up double digits on a year-to-date basis. However, it also gained more than 10% in the trailing year. That’s something to keep in mind if you want to go contrarian. Finally, Wall Street took a liking to INVZ, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. As well, analysts forecast a price target of $12.50, implying an upside potential of 171.74%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pinnacle West Capital is:8.7% = US$552m ÷ US$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.Does Pinnacle West Capital Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Pinnacle West Capital has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Electric Utilities industry average (8.7%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Pinnacle West Capital.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Pinnacle West Capital's Debt And Its 8.7% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Pinnacle West Capital, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.23. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

77,3dacf33d-8446-3858-9b65-5e3801f7e0af,NAVI,2023-02-20,Navient's (NASDAQ:NAVI) investors will be pleased with their notable 62% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/navients-nasdaq-navi-investors-pleased-100813218.html,1676887693,STORY,['NAVI'],"[By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) share price is up 40% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 20% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 4.6% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Navient To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Navient achieved compound earnings per share growth of 24% per year. The average annual share price increase of 12% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 3.74.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Navient's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Navient's TSR for the last 3 years was 62%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Navient has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 4.6% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 12% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Navient better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Navient is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 31% in three years, versus a market return of about 27%. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 25% in the last year.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, Verizon Communications actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 2.8% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It looks to us like the market was probably too optimistic around growth three years ago. However, taking a look at other business metrics might shed a bit more light on the share price action.Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market. Revenue has been pretty flat over three years, so that isn't an obvious reason shareholders would sell. So it might be worth looking at how revenue growth over time, in greater detail.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthVerizon Communications is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Verizon Communications, it has a TSR of -20% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Verizon Communications shareholders are down 21% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.7%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.7% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Verizon Communications has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Of course Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Buy For Income.After logging its worst annual performance in 14 years back in 2022, the S&amp;P 500 kicked off 2023 with a very strong January. The benchmarked index gained a little over 6% for the month as the first wave of fourth-quarter earnings reports came in better than many had feared. This performance bodes well for the remainder of 2023, at least from a historical perspective. However, Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners, says that the stock market and the economy aren’t in the clear just yet. According to Saperstein:“Markets have been reacting favorably to moderating inflation and expectations of a reduced pace of Fed tightening, but the lag effects of the Fed’s tightening so far will slow the economy in the second half of 2023 and cause analysts to slash earnings estimates, which ultimately is a headwind for stocks.”With persisting inflationary pressures and a possibility of a recession, investors are looking towards options to generate stable income. Dividend stocks have previously dealt favorably with uncertain market conditions and boosted investors’ confidence amid fluctuations. According to a report by iShares, dividend stocks reported a 12.5% decline in bear markets from 1978 to 2021, compared with a 30.7% drop in non-dividend stocks. Dividend-paying stocks tend to weather down equity markets better than non-payers. This seems intuitive, as the ability to consistently pay dividends suggests that a company is mature, has cash flow and cash on hand, all of which point towards the company in question being relatively stable.Companies that have historically raised their dividends consistently are known to demonstrate better income-generating abilities and market resilience compared to their peers. In that regard, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) are among the many names on this list that boast decades of dividend growth streaks and are outperforming the broader index this year so far.Story continues10 Best Stocks To Buy For IncomePhoto by Annie Spratt on UnsplashOur Methodology:We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds' holdings and picked the top 10 dividend-paying stocks with yields over 4.5% as of February 14.

(NASDAQ:HAS) after the company announced preliminary Q4 results below Wall Street estimates. The analyst was not surprised by this announcement as he was expecting worse results.

However, the weakening demand for its chips used in the gaming end market put a break in its growth momentum, as depicted in the last two reported quarters.In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, though NVIDIA’s revenues of $5.93 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.81 billion, revenues came 17% lower than the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to continued weakness across its Gaming and Professional Visualization market segments.Lower data center demand in China also hurt the top line in the reported quarter. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings plunged 50% year over year to 58 cents per share and missed the consensus mark by 17.1%. The trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter.NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteWeakness in Gaming Chip DemandNVIDIA experienced robust sales for its chips used in gaming end markets for the past couple of years. This was driven by pandemic-induced stay-at-home instructions.The demand for NVIDIA’s gaming chips increased immensely as people were surfing games to stay engaged and entertained indoors during lockdowns. Moreover, with the massive emergence of multiplayer online games and Gaming-as-a-Service concepts, the demand for graphic processing units shot up exponentially.However, the reopening of economies, along with the rising global slowdown concern amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the U.S.-China trade war, has been hurting the demand for gaming chips.NVDA’s revenues from the Gaming market platform plunged 51% year over year and 23% sequentially in the last reported quarter. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Gaming segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.61 billion, indicating a 52.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $3.42 billion.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Such companies, known to have experience in navigating market downturns, pay regular dividends. A market report provided by ProShares stated that the S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18%, while the Russell 2000 Index fell by more than 20% this past year. On the other hand, dividend stocks remained much more favorable and rewarded investors with strong, stable returns, outperforming both non-dividend stocks and bonds.Additionally, Hartford Funds states that dividends have played a significant role in the returns investors have received during the past half century, as 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index can be attributed to reinvested dividends since 1960, while the contribution of dividend incomes to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index averaged 40% till 2021.Companies with long histories of annual dividend growth are known to have positive performance over time. When a firm manages to raise its dividend year after year, through recession, war, market crashes and more, it's making a powerful statement about both its financial resilience and its commitment to shareholders.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”12.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 2.90%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company also manufactures, sells, and markets other non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. The beverage company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 61 years. It currently offers a per-share dividend of $0.46 every quarter with a dividend yield of 2.90%, as of February 14.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 from $68 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the company's ""robust"" 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company's 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was the leading stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q3 2022. Overall, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned investments in the company in Q3, worth over $25 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 4.75%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is an American alternative investment management company based in New York City whose private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyouts in the last three decades. Blackstone, Inc.

(NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assets We recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team. Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”7. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois, United States.

Among Abbott's most well-known brands are Pedialyte, Ensure, Similac, and Glucerna.On January 26, Stifel analyst Rick Wise raised his price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares, telling investors that the company's management had ""an encouragingly positive tone to start 2023"" on its earnings call. He adds that, with Abbott starting off with high-single-digit organic sales growth guidance and $4.30-$4.50 EPS guidance that ""basically brackets current consensus,"" the 2023 setup ""also appears encouraging.""Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.92%, as of February 14. The company has a run of 51 years of consistent dividend growth.At the end of September, 62 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), up from 61 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $3 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”6. Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023.  Suggested articles:15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This MonthDisclosure.

102,f2ddb87b-b5a1-381e-9307-e66e6eb3338a,CMCSA,2023-02-20,Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Dividend Will Be Increased To $0.29,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcasts-nasdaq-cmcsa-dividend-increased-101924693.html,1676888364,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[The board of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.29 on the 26th of April, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. The payment will take the dividend yield to 3.0%, which is in line with the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Comcast Comcast's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Prior to this announcement, Comcast's dividend made up quite a large proportion of earnings but only 40% of free cash flows. This leaves plenty of cash for reinvestment into the business.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 29%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated.historic-dividendComcast Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.325 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.16. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Comcast's EPS has fallen by approximately 23% per year during the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. We don't think Comcast is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”12.

The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 2.90%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company also manufactures, sells, and markets other non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. The beverage company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 61 years. It currently offers a per-share dividend of $0.46 every quarter with a dividend yield of 2.90%, as of February 14.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 from $68 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the company's ""robust"" 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company's 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was the leading stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q3 2022. Overall, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned investments in the company in Q3, worth over $25 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 4.75%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is an American alternative investment management company based in New York City whose private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyouts in the last three decades. Blackstone, Inc. (NYSE:BX) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.91 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.75%, as recorded on February 14.On January 27, BMO Capital analyst Rufus Hone raised the price target on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) to $92 from $85 but maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited the company's Q4 earnings beat and noted that Blackstone is incrementally positive around the outlook for Retail inflows recovering, and should benefit from any ""soft landing"" economic outcome.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds were bullish on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assets We recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team. Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”7. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois, United States. The company is known for its diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition products, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Among Abbott's most well-known brands are Pedialyte, Ensure, Similac, and Glucerna.On January 26, Stifel analyst Rick Wise raised his price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares, telling investors that the company's management had ""an encouragingly positive tone to start 2023"" on its earnings call. He adds that, with Abbott starting off with high-single-digit organic sales growth guidance and $4.30-$4.50 EPS guidance that ""basically brackets current consensus,"" the 2023 setup ""also appears encouraging.""Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.92%, as of February 14. The company has a run of 51 years of consistent dividend growth.At the end of September, 62 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), up from 61 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $3 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas.On February 15, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised the price target on Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023.  Suggested articles:15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This MonthDisclosure.

For more real estate stocks, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Real Estate Stocks Now. The real estate sector is one of the most lucrative industries in the world. Its importance is underscored by the fact that some of the largest economies in the world are inextricably linked to real estate development. The biggest example of the sector's importance is the 2008 financial crisis. This crisis, the after effects of which we are dealing with even today, shook the real estate industry badly . Spurred by a policy of low interest rates, homeowners borrowed extravagantly to own their properties, and banks then used these loans as an asset to sell their interest payments to investors. However, once the interest rates went up, the mortgage owners started to default - kicking a vicious cycle that forced the Federal Reserve to pump billions of dollars into the economy to prevent an all out collapse. How much did the Fed spend to prevent disaster? Well, its latest balance shows that while before the crisis its balance sheet had roughly $0.9 trillion of assets, these swelled to $2.2 trillion by the end of 2008. Effectively, the central bank had to more than double its assets to bail out big banks and the economy, and it is still struggling to contain it, as the coronavirus pandemic further exacerbated the problem and led to the balance sheet swelling to $8.96 trillion.Another more recent example of the perhaps outsized role that real estate plays come from the world's second largest economy, China. Spurred by the financial difficulties of China Evergrande Group (OTCMKTS:EGRNF), the crisis continues to threaten not only the Chinese market but also the global economy due to the interlinking of large asset managers such as BlackRock with the Chinese stock market. In order to stimulate real estate, and by extension the broader economy, the Chinese government allowed low interest rates and increased bank lending to real estate companies to build properties and increase home ownership in the country. These stimuli led to the home prices in Shanghai rising by a whopping 150% between 2003 and 2010 and paved the way for excessive borrowing for big construction companies who then used these loans to pay other debts and take out more loans. The spiral led to the government making new laws, called the Three Red Arrows, which limited real estate developers' ability to raise new funds. Steeped in debt, Evergrande found it difficult to raise working capital and missed bond payments.Story continuesIn terms of market value, the real estate sector is one of the most valuable in the world. According to research from Allied Market, the global real estate market was worth a whopping $28 trillion in 2021. From then until 2031, the firm believes that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% to sit at an estimated $48 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Cementing the importance of China in the industry, Allied Market Research points out that Asia Pacific is the world's largest real estate sector, and that it accounts for more than two fifths of the global market. However, in terms of growth, the research firm believes that Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa (LAMEA) market will be the strongest growing region, as it outpaces the broader industry by posting a CAGR of 6.4%.Today we'll look at some of the biggest money makers in the real estate world, with the top performers being Longfor Group Holdings Limited (HKG:0960.HK), China Overseas Land &amp; Investment Limited (HKG:0688.HK), and Prologis, Inc.

The bid is expected to trigger a highly competitive bidding war for the club, which is currently majority-owned by the U.S.-based Glazer family. The consortium includes Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the former Prime Minister of Qatar and ex-head of the Qatar Investment Authority.Raine Group, a New York-based bank, is advising the Glazer family and has set a deadline of Feb. 17 for bids. Reports from last week suggested that the bank is anticipating at least five serious bidders for the club. Only British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe has confirmed his intention to acquire Manchester United. The Glazer family is believed to be keen to retain its majority ownership of the club.Qatar Sports Investments, a separate Qatari entity, already owns the French club Paris Saint-Germain. UEFA, the top football governing body in Europe, does not permit two clubs owned by the same entity to compete in Europe’s biggest competitions.Bloomberg reports that no final decision has been made about which Qatari entities will provide capital for the Manchester United bid.Shares gained nearly 11% this week.Vince McMahon seeking up to $9B in Sale of World Wrestling Entertainment: reportVince McMahon, the controlling shareholder of World Wrestling Entertainment (NYSE:WWE), is reportedly seeking as much as $9B in a potential sale of the wrestling giant, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.The WWE has already received offers and is currently valued at around $6.5B.

Barberio, Non-Executive Chairman of the Life Storage Board.Following the announcement, Citi downgraded Life Storage from Buy to Neutral with a price target of $126.00.

If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Buy For Income.After logging its worst annual performance in 14 years back in 2022, the S&amp;P 500 kicked off 2023 with a very strong January. The benchmarked index gained a little over 6% for the month as the first wave of fourth-quarter earnings reports came in better than many had feared. This performance bodes well for the remainder of 2023, at least from a historical perspective. However, Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners, says that the stock market and the economy aren’t in the clear just yet. According to Saperstein:“Markets have been reacting favorably to moderating inflation and expectations of a reduced pace of Fed tightening, but the lag effects of the Fed’s tightening so far will slow the economy in the second half of 2023 and cause analysts to slash earnings estimates, which ultimately is a headwind for stocks.”With persisting inflationary pressures and a possibility of a recession, investors are looking towards options to generate stable income. Dividend stocks have previously dealt favorably with uncertain market conditions and boosted investors’ confidence amid fluctuations. According to a report by iShares, dividend stocks reported a 12.5% decline in bear markets from 1978 to 2021, compared with a 30.7% drop in non-dividend stocks. Dividend-paying stocks tend to weather down equity markets better than non-payers. This seems intuitive, as the ability to consistently pay dividends suggests that a company is mature, has cash flow and cash on hand, all of which point towards the company in question being relatively stable.Companies that have historically raised their dividends consistently are known to demonstrate better income-generating abilities and market resilience compared to their peers. In that regard, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) are among the many names on this list that boast decades of dividend growth streaks and are outperforming the broader index this year so far.Story continues10 Best Stocks To Buy For IncomePhoto by Annie Spratt on UnsplashOur Methodology:We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds' holdings and picked the top 10 dividend-paying stocks with yields over 4.5% as of February 14.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.3%, which is fairly typical for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. McDonald's was earning enough to cover the previous dividend, but it was paying out quite a large proportion of its free cash flows. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 54.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 48%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMcDonald's Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $2.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $6.08. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.1% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.McDonald's Could Grow Its DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that McDonald's has been growing its earnings per share at 5.6% a year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.Our Thoughts On McDonald's' DividendIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think McDonald's' payments are rock solid. While McDonald's is earning enough to cover the dividend, we are generally unimpressed with its future prospects. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”12.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

According to the analyst, the company's ""robust"" 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company's 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was the leading stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q3 2022. Overall, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned investments in the company in Q3, worth over $25 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 4.75%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is an American alternative investment management company based in New York City whose private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyouts in the last three decades.

(NYSE:BX) to $92 from $85 but maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares.

(NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assets We recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team. Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”7. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois, United States. The company is known for its diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition products, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Among Abbott's most well-known brands are Pedialyte, Ensure, Similac, and Glucerna.On January 26, Stifel analyst Rick Wise raised his price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares, telling investors that the company's management had ""an encouragingly positive tone to start 2023"" on its earnings call. He adds that, with Abbott starting off with high-single-digit organic sales growth guidance and $4.30-$4.50 EPS guidance that ""basically brackets current consensus,"" the 2023 setup ""also appears encouraging.""Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.92%, as of February 14. The company has a run of 51 years of consistent dividend growth.At the end of September, 62 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), up from 61 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $3 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”6. Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas.On February 15, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised the price target on Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023.  Suggested articles:15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This MonthDisclosure.

For more real estate stocks, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Real Estate Stocks Now. The real estate sector is one of the most lucrative industries in the world. Its importance is underscored by the fact that some of the largest economies in the world are inextricably linked to real estate development. The biggest example of the sector's importance is the 2008 financial crisis. This crisis, the after effects of which we are dealing with even today, shook the real estate industry badly . Spurred by a policy of low interest rates, homeowners borrowed extravagantly to own their properties, and banks then used these loans as an asset to sell their interest payments to investors. However, once the interest rates went up, the mortgage owners started to default - kicking a vicious cycle that forced the Federal Reserve to pump billions of dollars into the economy to prevent an all out collapse. How much did the Fed spend to prevent disaster? Well, its latest balance shows that while before the crisis its balance sheet had roughly $0.9 trillion of assets, these swelled to $2.2 trillion by the end of 2008. Effectively, the central bank had to more than double its assets to bail out big banks and the economy, and it is still struggling to contain it, as the coronavirus pandemic further exacerbated the problem and led to the balance sheet swelling to $8.96 trillion.Another more recent example of the perhaps outsized role that real estate plays come from the world's second largest economy, China. Spurred by the financial difficulties of China Evergrande Group (OTCMKTS:EGRNF), the crisis continues to threaten not only the Chinese market but also the global economy due to the interlinking of large asset managers such as BlackRock with the Chinese stock market. In order to stimulate real estate, and by extension the broader economy, the Chinese government allowed low interest rates and increased bank lending to real estate companies to build properties and increase home ownership in the country. These stimuli led to the home prices in Shanghai rising by a whopping 150% between 2003 and 2010 and paved the way for excessive borrowing for big construction companies who then used these loans to pay other debts and take out more loans. The spiral led to the government making new laws, called the Three Red Arrows, which limited real estate developers' ability to raise new funds. Steeped in debt, Evergrande found it difficult to raise working capital and missed bond payments.Story continuesIn terms of market value, the real estate sector is one of the most valuable in the world. According to research from Allied Market, the global real estate market was worth a whopping $28 trillion in 2021. From then until 2031, the firm believes that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% to sit at an estimated $48 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Cementing the importance of China in the industry, Allied Market Research points out that Asia Pacific is the world's largest real estate sector, and that it accounts for more than two fifths of the global market. However, in terms of growth, the research firm believes that Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa (LAMEA) market will be the strongest growing region, as it outpaces the broader industry by posting a CAGR of 6.4%.Today we'll look at some of the biggest money makers in the real estate world, with the top performers being Longfor Group Holdings Limited (HKG:0960.HK), China Overseas Land &amp; Investment Limited (HKG:0688.HK), and Prologis, Inc.

117,7ae7fbe3-0574-3c90-a51c-30b3f508f4e9,RHI,2023-02-20,7 Stocks to Buy as Employees Prepare to Quit En Masse,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-employees-prepare-193630200.html,1676576190,STORY,"['RHI', 'MSFT', 'PYPL', 'UPWK', 'DASH']","[Although gainful employment may seemingly represent a source of gratitude during a season of layoffs, that might not be the case right now, thus cynically bolstering the narrative for specific stocks to buy. According to a late-Jan. 2023 report by Chicago-based staffing firm LaSalle Network, its survey found that 85% of U.S. workers may consider leaving their jobs in the next six months.If so, that would likely impose a radical paradigm shift in the labor force. To be clear, it’s not that 85% of workers already have their foot out the door. However, the magnitude of dissatisfaction should startle onlookers. For instance, the survey found that “39% of managers are dissatisfied with their roles, compared to only 29% of staff-level employees.” Therefore, a possible quitting en masse could cut a diverse range of career trajectories.Again, it’s unlikely that so many workers would just up and quit, particularly during a rough economic cycle. Nevertheless, investors should prepare for some discontent materializing in the form of resignation letters. Below are the stocks to buy to bank on this trend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMSFTMicrosoft$265.58PYPLPayPal$78.15RHIRobert Half$83.30DASHDoorDash$67.73UPWKUpwork$12.41ROVRRover Group$4.02PIXYShiftPixy$8.10Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fits in well with practically any subject. And so it is with rising discontent in the workplace. Should people leave their current jobs, it’s likely more than a few will try their luck with the gig economy. And why not?With Industry Research analysts pegging the segment to command a valuation of $873 billion by 2027, in some ways, it’s better to start early. The dirty secret about gig work is that it’s a competitive field. Further, enterprises have a good idea with whom they wish to collaborate. Thus, it’s probably better to get a foot in the door and establish a strong reputation early.Story continuesShould this framework materialize, Microsoft practically enjoys a natural monopoly with its Software as a Service. No matter how many times other competitors enter the field, Microsoft utterly dominates office applications like Word or Excel. Don’t expect this to change anytime soon. Further, Wall Street digs MSFT, pegging it a strong buy. Thus, I wouldn’t fight the tape – it’s one of the stocks to buy.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAn indirect player in the gig economy, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) nevertheless strikes an incredibly relevant tone. Primarily a digital payments processor, the underlying platform provides a convenient and intuitive business app for independent professionals. From receiving payment for goods or services delivered to its automated record-keeping system, PayPal is a blessing for gig workers.To be fair, the competition presents a concern, particularly in the broader financial technology ecosystem. Nevertheless, PayPal brings much trust to the table, having been created in December 1998. Significantly, it’s not some fly-by-night operation, which gives confidence to those that are just starting out on the road to business independence.According to Gurufocus.com, PYPL rates as significantly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value. On an objective basis, PayPal enjoys strong growth metrics, especially revenue growth of 16.7% in the past three years. This ranks better than nearly 78% of the competition. As well, Wall Street analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $101.77, implying nearly 31% upside potential.Robert Half (RHI)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockWith more than a few workers expressing discontent, the case for Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) suddenly looks quite intriguing. Now, let me first acknowledge that RHI does carry risks regarding stocks to buy on shifting work paradigms. After all, RHI stumbled more than 32% during the trailing year. And for the fourth quarter of 2022, Robert Half’s revenue tally of $1.73 billion fell 2.4% on a year-over-year basis.However, not everyone who’s discontent in the office will join the gig economy. From personal experience, it’s better to have a job and inch your way into the arena. Going full bore into the gig lifestyle can create needless headaches and anxieties. Instead, the dissatisfied may simply want a change of scenery. For that, Robert Half provides an intriguing profile.Also, the recent surge in mass layoffs may cynically favor RHI stock. Essentially, beggars can’t be choosers anymore with enterprises shaving headcount. Thus, when a reasonable opportunity – not a perfect one – comes up, more people may be inclined to take it.DoorDash (DASH)Close up of Doordash (DASH) logo and symbol displayed at the entrance to one of their officesSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of mass layoffs, it might be a good time to have a loose discussion about DoorDash (NYSE:DASH). By loose, I simply mean that the food-delivery service represents a higher-risk, higher-reward opportunity. Therefore, it’s not one of the stocks to buy with mortgage money. Rather, it’s an investment with morning coffee shop money, if that makes sense.Fundamentally, the rise of discontent in the workplace should make DoorDash progressively more intriguing. Even without the extraordinary pressures of the pandemic, corporate burnout represented a significant dilemma. For many folks, the allure of a paycheck just isn’t enough to work the daily grind in the cubicle. Rather, they may value more their quality of time on this Earth.Now, I’m not suggesting that DoorDash represents the holy grail of the gig economy – it’s not. However, I’ve seen far too many diverse groups of people work food-delivery jobs to recognize that at least some do it because they hate the suit-and-tie paradigm.For full disclosure, Dash continues to post net losses, which isn’t encouraging. However, it enjoys stout stability in the balance sheet, making it an interesting idea for stocks to buy.Upwork (UPWK)The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.Source: Funstock / Shutterstock.comGiven that so many managers seem dissatisfied with their jobs, many people seeking an exit from the rat race may quit corporate America altogether, instead joining the ranks of the gig economy. After all, people in middle management likely got to their position based on both experience and acumen. Therefore, they might put their skills to the test in the freelancer market, which may bode well for Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK).Connecting enterprises that need short-term roles filled with independent professionals that can fill them, Upwork represents a direct player in the gig economy. Coincidentally, shares have been soaring this year, just as worker dissatisfaction is apparently rising. Since the January opener, UPWK gained over 29% of its equity value.To be fair, UPWK also presents a wildly risky profile among stocks to buy. In the past 365 days, shares fell 45%. Also, the financials leave much to be desired, particularly in the revenue growth and earnings department. Still, Wall Street loves UPWK, pegging it a consensus strong buy. Also, analysts’ average price target of $17.67 implies upside potential of nearly 27%.Rover Group (ROVR)A terrier lies on a dog bed with a cone on.Source: ShutterstockFor those seeking a fun, if not unorthodox platform for the gig economy, Rover Group (NASDAQ:ROVR) might fit the bill. Similar to Upwork above, Rover represents a direct player among stocks to buy for the gig economy. But rather than connecting businesses with independent professionals, Rover connects pet (dog) owners with pet service providers. These services may include dog-walking sessions or boarding.Fundamentally, Rover checks so many boxes. For one thing, several managers and rank-and-file worker bees report job dissatisfaction. Part of that stems from working with silly humans and their drama. Dogs? They’re four-legged manifestations of unconditional love.In terms of demand, the narrative for Rover should only accelerate from here on out. True, the pandemic forced many people indoors, allowing them to care for their pets. But guess what? Some of the biggest enterprises have quashed remote operations. And that means people will now have to find some means to care for their pets while they’re away nine to five. To be fair, it’s a risky narrative because of the yet-to-be-proven financials. Still, it’s such a great narrative that it might be worth a speculative bet.ShiftPixy (PIXY)ShiftPixy (PIXY) logo displayed on a smartphone screen with company website on computer monitor behind smartphoneSource: shutterstock.com/T. SchneiderBefore discussing ShiftPixy (NASDAQ:PIXY), the narrative requires a caveat or five. Primarily, it’s an extremely risky “investment,” so much so that I hesitated to include it on this list of “stocks to buy.” During the trailing year, PIXY suffered a devastating blow, hemorrhaging 92% of its equity value. It doesn’t take rocket science to realize that companies don’t lose that much value without a reason.So, why bother mentioning ShiftPixy at all? Fundamentally, I go back to the narrative. The company specializes in a next-generation human resources platform that connects employers and employees. Further, the platform has significant implications for the gig economy in reducing the impact of worker turnover. Essentially, ShiftPixy keeps enterprises’ schedules stacked with a live, on-demand workforce.With several people questioning the nature of work in the post-pandemic paradigm, a reliable schedule has never been more important for companies. Therefore, PIXY could rise above the muck, despite earlier troubles.However, this doesn’t mean you should ignore the risks so only wager with money you can afford to lose.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

118,0b489ac9-d79f-392d-a8a1-a853ddb27a18,UPS,2023-02-20,United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-nyse-ups-seems-120024038.html,1676894424,STORY,['UPS'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service What Is United Parcel Service's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that United Parcel Service had US$19.7b of debt in December 2022, down from US$21.5b, one year before. However, it also had US$7.60b in cash, and so its net debt is US$12.1b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At United Parcel Service's LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that United Parcel Service had liabilities of US$18.1b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$33.2b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$7.60b and US$12.6b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$31.1b.Of course, United Parcel Service has a titanic market capitalization of US$158.5b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).United Parcel Service has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.65. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 29.6 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. Also good is that United Parcel Service grew its EBIT at 19% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine United Parcel Service's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, United Parcel Service produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 68% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewUnited Parcel Service's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its net debt to EBITDA also supports that impression! Looking at the bigger picture, we think United Parcel Service's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with United Parcel Service (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) .When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2023.Warren Buffett really needs no introduction. Whether you're familiar with the stock market or not, chances are that you have come across his name in the media at least once during your lifetime. The 'Oracle of Omaha' is one of the most, if not the most, renowned investors in the world and one whose patient approach of building wealth over decades of holding investments after carefully picking out companies to invest in has no parallel in an industry where hedge funds and retail investors chase after returns on a daily basis.His stock picking prowess has made Mr. Buffett one of the world's wealthiest people, with a net worth of a whopping $118 billion as of February 2023 according to estimates made by Forbes Magazine. While he has been a billionaire for many years, the financial guru's wealth has nearly doubled over the past two years — according to the same magazine, he was worth $68 billion as recently as 2020. The growth in Mr. Buffett's fortunes is the market rewarding him for conservative stock picking, as last year's inflationary wave combined with the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike spree decimated risky stocks that the billionaire avoids.He is also a centurion, and in August this year will turn 93 - making him also one of the oldest investors out there in addition to one of the most successful. Naturally, this leads to fewer public appearances by Mr. Buffett, but his investment approach is well known nevertheless particularly since countless books and articles have already covered it. He and his long time business partner Mr. Charlie Munger run Berkshire Hathaway, one of the largest holding companies in the world with interests in countless businesses such as technology, insurance, aviation, finance, energy, and retail. In his latest letter to Berkshire shareholders, published last year, Mr. Buffett talked about his friendship with Mr. Munger and the experiences that he has gained over the course of his long and fulfilling life. According to the Oracle of Omaha, teaching is one of his best experiences, and his life has provided him the opportunity to interact with students of all ages.Story continuesIn his own words:Talking to university students is far superior. I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2) with the kind of people they would select, if they had no need for money. Economic realities, I acknowledge, may interfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sort of job, they will no longer be “working.”Charlie and I, ourselves, followed that liberating course after a few early stumbles. We both started as part- timers at my grandfather’s grocery store, Charlie in 1940 and I in 1942. We were each assigned boring tasks and paid little, definitely not what we had in mind. Charlie later took up law, and I tried selling securities. Job satisfaction continued to elude us.Finally, at Berkshire, we found what we love to do. With very few exceptions, we have now “worked” for many decades with people whom we like and trust. It’s a joy in life to join with managers such as Paul Andrews or the Berkshire families I told you about last year. In our home office, we employ decent and talented people – no jerks. Turnover averages, perhaps, one person per year.His patient approach to investment, as opposed to today's fast paced, algorithm driven trading environment, has led to Mr. Buffett holding on to shares of companies for decades. For instance, his current portfolio reveals that the oracle's oldest investment right continues to be The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), in which he first invested in 1988 and is on record saying that he will never sell the shares. His second oldest investment right now is in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) - a company in which he has held a stake for almost three decades now.

QuoteFactors to NoteAccelerating cloud migration and data-driven digital transformation by businesses across the globe are likely to have boosted demand for NetApp’s product portfolio. The continuation of work-from-home and hybrid-work innovation are other driving factors. NetApp specializes in providing cloud services, systems and software to business organizations for optimal operations of applications from the data center to cloud.NetApp’s strengthening go-to-market activities, various cloud collaborations and continued product innovation amid a robust demand environment are likely to have acted as additional tailwinds. Healthy adoption of new product launches like NetApp BlueXP augurs well. NetApp BlueXP is a unified control plane that provides hybrid multicloud experience for data and storage services.Renewed momentum in Spot by NetApp portfolio might have aided the Public Cloud Services business along with strong demand for other cloud solutions like Azure NetApp files, Cloud Volumes and Cloud Insights services. Spot by NetApp enables enterprises to make multi-cloud management easier and lower expenses at the same time.Incremental gains from an uptick in the company’s NetApp Astra solution and NetApp ONTAP data management software might have favored the top line. Synergies from the buyouts of CloudCheckr and Data Mechanics bode well. NetApp’s recent buyouts include Fylamynt and Instaclustr.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hybrid Cloud segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.46 billion. Strength in the company’s object storage and all-flash business is expected to have cushioned the segment’s revenues. Software product revenues are likely to have gained from the favorable mix shift to the all-flash portfolio.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Public Cloud Services revenues is pegged at $153 million.Weakness in global macroeconomic conditions and cutback in spending by clients are likely to have affected NetApp’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.

Factors to NoteIn the fourth quarter of 2022, PSEG’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures. Such a weather pattern is expected to have contributed to the company’s fourth-quarter revenues, buoyed by the increased electricity demand for cooling purposes.Additionally, some parts of its service territories experienced significant precipitation levels, resulting in wet weather conditions. Moreover, rate-based growth from regulated investments may have positively contributed to its fourth-quarter revenues.However, its service territories were impacted by immense flooding conditions in the fourth quarter, which is likely to have disrupted the smooth flow of electricity to its customers. This may have negatively impacted the company’s fourth-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.18 billion, suggesting a decrease of 28.7% from the year-ago quarter.Immense flooding conditions, as mentioned above, may have caused infrastructural damage for the utility, increasing the company’s operating expenses for restoration and repairing. This is likely to have weighed on its bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. However, lower operating &amp; maintenance expenses and lower depreciation and interest expenses related to the Fossil divestiture may have benefited the bottom line in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 63 cents per share, indicating a decline of 8.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurprisePublic Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurprisePublic Service Enterprise Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated QuoteStory continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PSEG this time.

123,469256eb-06cb-31cc-a766-64bdda3c135f,PPL,2023-02-20,PPL (NYSE:PPL) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.24,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppl-nyse-ppl-increasing-dividend-100831021.html,1676887711,STORY,['PPL'],"[PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 3rd of April to $0.24. This takes the annual payment to 3.3% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. View our latest analysis for PPL PPL's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, PPL was paying out a fairly large proportion of earnings, and it wasn't generating positive free cash flows either. This is a pretty unsustainable practice, and could be risky if continued for the long term.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 87.9%. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 49% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.44 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.96. The dividend has shrunk at around 4.0% a year during that period. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Over the past five years, it looks as though PPL's EPS has declined at around 10% a year. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think PPL will make a great income stock. The payments are bit high to be considered sustainable, and the track record isn't the best. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for PPL that you should be aware of before investing.

(NYSE:TXT) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/83-institutional-ownership-textron-inc-141520333.html,1676816120,STORY,"['TXT', 'TROW']","[A look at the shareholders of Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 83% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Textron, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Textron ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Textron?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Textron already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Textron's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Textron. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 11% and 8.5% of the stock.We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of TextronWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Textron Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$63m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Textron. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

I'm here with Damian Gammell, our CEO; and Nik Jhangiani, our CFO. Before we begin with our opening remarks on our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, a reminder of our cautionary statements. This call will contain forward-looking management comments and other statements reflecting our outlook. These comments should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary language contained in today's release as well as the detailed cautionary statements found in reports filed with the U.K., U.S., Dutch and Spanish authorities. A copy of this information is available on our website at www.cocacolaep.com. Prepared remarks will be made by Damian and Nik and accompanied by a slide deck.We will then turn the call over to your questions. Unless otherwise stated, metrics presented today will be on a comparable and FX-neutral basis throughout. Any growth rate will be also presented on a pro forma basis. With the full year financial year of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners behind us, please note that pro forma growth rates will no longer be relevant when talking about FY '23 and beyond. Following the call, a full transcript will be made available as soon as possible on our website. And finally, before I turn over the call to our CEO, Damian, if you live in GB, please not worry about the recent news coverage about the much loved brand and one of my personal favorite Lilt. It is not disappearing, but being rebranded as Fanta pineapple and grapefruit.So on that positive note, over to you, Damian.Damian Gammell: Thank you, Sarah, and many thanks to everyone joining us today. Before we start with our key messages, I'd particularly like to thank all of my colleagues at CCEP for their incredible commitment and hard work throughout what was our first full year as Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. And indeed, what a great year it has been. I am delighted with our financial performance achieving strong top and bottom line growth with revenue and profits both ahead of 2019 levels, value share gains and a very impressive free cash flow generation. This has allowed us to pay a record dividend to our shareholders. As a diverse and sustainable bottler, we firmly believe we are well placed for growth in 2023 and beyond. We also operate within a resilient and growing category with great brands that our consumers continue to love.Story continuesWe will continue to invest and innovate in these brands and their packaging supporting a solid growth platform for all our customers. We are confident in the future and are fully committed to the higher midterm objectives announced at our Capital Markets Day in November. And finally, we are very proud of our strong relationship and alignment with the Coca-Cola Company, and all other valued brand partners. So this slide and graphics will be familiar. We have a clear but vital purpose to refresh Europe and API and critically to make a difference for all our communities and our stakeholders. And we have a clear focus around great people, great service, great beverages, all done sustainably for a better shared future. So now I'd like to touch on each of these areas as we look back at 2022.CCEP's ambition for growth and sustainability depend on our great people and the well-being and safety of our colleagues remains our number 1 priority as a company. We finished 2022 with a world-class safety performance. We are committed to encouraging all our employees to live happy, healthy lives so that they're engaged at work and able to perform at their best. I'm pleased many of you got to see this for yourselves during the market and plant tours as part of our recent capital markets event in London. We now offer a new employee assistance program or EAP in all markets, providing all our employees with access to counseling, advice or specialist information. We accelerated our diversity and inclusion progress, and this continues to be recognized externally, too.I am pleased that we are recently included on the 2023 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the third year running. This demonstrates our commitment to gender diversity and equality and fostering an inclusive culture for everyone at CCEP. We continue to encourage a culture of innovation and improve our digital tools in the workplace and we were awarded gold at the U.K. Employee Experience Awards in recognition of our program. Great service remains a key priority and is a critical driver of our performance. Once again, we were the largest creator of value in the retail channel for our customers within FMCG in Europe and in NARTD and API according to Nielsen. And in Australia, we were the largest value creator within the alcohol category to gaining over 250 basis points of value share in the RTD space.I'm extremely proud of the way we successfully navigated supply chain challenges throughout the year and importantly, continue to invest ensuring our products were available on shelf and online and maintaining our high levels of customer service. This year, we installed 4 new lines and upgraded 2 existing lines, helping us to meet the growing consumer demand for our beverages whilst also delivering a range of sustainability benefits. For example, our new state-of-the-art can line in Moorabbin, Victoria, is able to make up to 1,700 tons per minute in a variety of formats, including mini cans, while also using less water and less energy than our existing lines. In recognition of world-class customer service and execution, the Netherlands were the runner up in the annual global Coca-Cola Bottler competition, the Candler Cup.And we've seen some great activation, particularly around the World Cup and throughout the really important festive periods of Ramadan and Christmas. On digital, we continue to accelerate our B2B platforms hitting record revenues of €2 billion in 2022. That was up 50% versus 2021. And finally, through our ventures program, we recently partnered with 2 universities who will be undertaking academic research into direct air capture at our sites to help us reduce carbon emissions on our journey to net zero. We are extremely privileged to make, move and sell the best beverages in the world, and we continue to recruit new shoppers across our portfolio. In fact, in Europe, over 75% of households purchased from an NARTD portfolio in 2022, that's up 70 basis points versus last year.You will recall that we rolled out a new taste, new look and a new campaign for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar across our markets throughout 2021. This has been a great success, driving volume growth of 10% in 2022 or an impressive 23.5% when you compare it to 2019. Coca-Cola creations were also a great success in 2022 with more excitement and new flavors to come this year. Within flavors, new Fanta flavor launches and the latest What the Fanta campaign continues to drive excitement for our consumers, particularly over Halloween. We also launched Sprite Lemon plus, with added caffeine, in Australia with really promising early results. Monster continued to gain share through innovation with more flavors launched in the Juice and Ultra ranges during 2022.In coffee, we launched a new Costa FrappÃ© range. And in Australia, Suntory's Minus 196 double lemon, a brand that has proved really popular in Japan, continued to deliver solid growth. And all of this will continue to be done more sustainably. Our This is Forward commitments were extended to our API markets in 2022, resulting in a unified action plan for CCEP. We continue to make great progress against our commitments and are taking action where it matters most. In Europe, we launched tethered closures on our PET bottles in 7 markets with more to follow in 2023. This new design, which includes a lighter weight neck, is estimated to save at least 1 gram of plastic per bottle, equating to approximately 15,000 tonnes of CO2 and over 9,000 tonnes of plastic a year by 2024.In Australia and Indonesia, we invested in new PET recycling facilities. These collaborations are a step forward towards creating a circular economy for PET and we'll continue to further accelerating our journey towards the ultimate goal of using 100% recycled or renewable plastic. Four more of our production facilities became carbon neutral in 2022, totaling 6 to date across different markets. Our progress continues to be recognized and we are proud to have retained our coveted CDP and MSCI ratings for the 7th consecutive year. CCEP was also recognized for sustainability leadership within the Coca-Cola system by winning the prestigious 2021 J. Paul Austin Award. And finally, I have the pleasure in sharing that CCEP recently became a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, an important partnership as we continue our efforts to transition to a circular economy.So all in all, a great year of progress. Turning now to our 2022 performance highlights. We're really pleased with our top line performance. The continued recovery of away-from-home and further growth in the home channel helped drive a 9.5% increase in comparable volumes. Our continued focus on revenue growth management and in particular, our efforts to actively manage headline pricing and optimize promotions across our broad pack offering, drove solid revenue per unit case growth of 6%. This is ahead of pre-pandemic levels but below realized cost inflation, reflected in our margins as we continue to prioritize relevance and affordability of our brands for the consumer. We continue to win with our customers, and this momentum is evidenced by our NARTD value share gains and value creation.Our continued focus on driving efficiencies which Nik will cover in more detail shortly, helped drive solid operating profit growth of 12.5%. This all resulted in an impressive adjusted free cash flow generation of €1.8 billion enabling us to pay a record dividend to our shareholders. And as mentioned earlier, we've made great progress on sustainability initiatives. And I'd now like to hand over to Nik to talk in more detail to the financials. Nik?Nik Jhangiani: Thank you, Damian, and thank you all for joining us today. Let me start by taking you through our financial summary. We delivered total revenue of €17.3 billion, an increase of 15.5% and our COGS per unit case increased by 9%, both of which I'll come back to shortly. We delivered comparable operating profit of €2.1 billion, up 12.5%, reflecting our solid top line growth, the benefit of our ongoing efficiency programs and our efforts on managing discretionary spend. In line with our guidance, our comparable effective tax rate increased to approximately 22% from 21% in 2021. This is largely due to differences in the mix of taxable profits across our different territories and the reassessment of our uncertain tax positions.This resulted in comparable diluted earnings per share of €3.39, up 14%. Free cash generation continues to be a core priority, and we delivered an impressive €1.8 billion on an adjusted basis during 2022, and I'll cover that in more detail in a few moments. And finally, on shareholder returns, we paid a total 2022 dividend per share of €1.68, up 20% versus 2021. In absolute terms, this equates to total dividends paid of approximately €760 million, which as Damian mentioned, is the largest payment in our company's history. So now if I turn to our revenue highlights. The strong growth in our revenue was driven by both an increase in volume and importantly, our revenue per case. Unsurprisingly, the most significant improvement has been in our away-from-home volumes given last year's base was still impacted by lockdown restrictions.That said, we are pleased that our away-from-home volumes have broadly returned to 2019 levels, with traction in immediate consumption and the rebound in tourism. GB has been the standout here with away-from-Home volumes in double-digit growth versus 2019 and Iberia with strong recovery to slightly above 2019 levels as well. Strong trading in the home channel continued, benefiting from the increased at-home occasions as well as continued growth in online grocery with volumes up 4% versus 2021, or up 6.5% versus 2019. So volumes were slightly softer in the fourth quarter, up 1.5%, impacted by some customer disruption in Germany as well as tougher prior year comps. Excluding this customer disruption, volume growth in the home channel would have been positive in the fourth quarter versus the minus 1% detailed in the release.I am pleased that we were able to resolve this customer negotiation during the quarter. And as Damian referenced earlier, our priority is and will continue to be, to lead the category for sustainable value creation for all our customers. Moving now to revenue per unit case, which grew by 6% for the full year, reflecting the strong growth in away-from-home, but also a testament to our revenue growth management initiatives with positive headline price, pack and brand mix. Unsurprisingly, pricing took a bigger role in 2022 compared to previous years, given the inflationary environment, and we successfully implemented both our first and second round headline pricing strategies across all markets, and I'll update on 2023 shortly. Revenue by segment is also referred to here.Coca Cola, Brand, BillboardPhoto by Hamish Weir on UnsplashYou can see more detailed commentary by geography in the release, but at a headline level, Great Britain and Iberia were the stand outs, but with both Europe and API ahead of 2019 levels on a revenue basis. So moving now to COGS per unit case, which increased by 9%, slightly ahead of our 8.5% guidance. This difference was primarily driven by higher concentrate costs as a result of our incidence pricing model. This is, as you know, directly linked to our revenue per unit case growth, which was stronger than anticipated as a result of our successful RGM and second round pricing initiatives. As expected, we saw commodity inflation in the low 20s, in line with our guidance, reflecting higher aluminum and rPET pricing as well as the impact of higher gas and power pricing on our conversion costs, this past being more second half weighted.Now moving to OpEx and our efficiency programs. We have now delivered over 90% of our full year '21 to '23 program, which ultimately will amount to approximately €375 million of benefits in total. We will deliver the final €30 million during 2023. And in November, we announced a new efficiency program aiming to deliver €350 million to €400 million of incremental savings by full year 2028. As a reminder, these benefits will be weighted towards 2024 and beyond. You can now see on this slide that as a percent of revenue, our OpEx continued to decline in 2022, reflecting our extremely disciplined focus on driving efficiencies throughout the cost base more than offsetting our underlying cost inflation as well as the increase in our volume-related costs and of course, TME which has naturally increased to support our top line growth.Importantly, our OpEx has declined not only compared to last year, but more importantly, around 200 basis points lower as a percentage of revenue compared to 2019. Going forward, we will continue to manage costs very tightly, but do anticipate further inflationary pressures in areas like labor and haulage as well as a certain element linked to volume growth this year. So turning to free cash flow in more detail, a hugely important metric for us and for you as well. We generated €1.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow in full year 2022 and this slide lays out the key components. Recognizing the importance of targeted investment, we spent approximately €600 million in CapEx, excluding leases, on supply chain, digital and other technologies as well as cold drink equipment.And as you know, working capital remains a core focus for us, and I'm really pleased that we delivered yet another year of significant benefits. This included a notable improvement in API as we rolled out our proven working capital initiatives in that region. For example, we have now aligned API's annual incentives to Europe so that incorporates free cash flow as a targeted measure, which has naturally encouraged more focus on delivering improvements. This has helped drive approximately €120 million of working capital improvements in API since the acquisition, taking the cumulative amount, including Europe to approximately €1.2 billion since 2017, a remarkable performance. Finally, you will see our reported free cash flow also includes the benefit of a VAT tax refund in Spain amounting to approximately €250 million.We have excluded this from the adjusted free cash flow to allow for better comparability, given the unusual nature of this item. And now to our leverage and balance sheet. We ended 2022 with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.5x demonstrating the pace of deleveraging since we closed the Amatil transaction in May 2021. Given our strong focus on driving cash and working capital improvements, we remain confident that we will reach the top end of our target leverage range of 2.5x to 3x by the end of 2023, while remaining fully committed to our strong investment-grade ratings. We have a strong and flexible balance sheet. And as a reminder, we won't need to refinance any of our existing debt for another 2-plus years, which is certainly helpful in the current volatile rates environment.Moving now to API and an update on some of our portfolio initiatives. We have now exited beer and cider in Australia as planned, and the majority of the proceeds have been received from the sale of our CCEP-owned NARTD brands as well. And we have a more streamlined portfolio in Indonesia, focused on our core Sparkling and tea categories, which has allowed us to manage our supply chain more efficiently and deliver even better service to our customers across key calendar events like Ramadan and the Chinese New Year. Indonesia is a hugely exciting and attractive market for us, and so we're really pleased to announce the purchase of the Coca-Cola Company's 29.4% minority stake in our Indonesia business, increasing CCEP's ownership to 100%. This was for a total consideration of €282 million, and please note that this price includes a significant amount of cash on the local balance sheet and represents KO's fair share of that cash.While this transaction will be EPS accretive, it will have a minimal impact at the group level for full year 2023. This now simplifies our ownership structure while demonstrating our commitment to the future of this exciting market. In fact, the more time Damian and I spend in Indonesia, the more excited we get about the opportunities ahead. This is a market with a fantastic growth opportunity in the NARTD category of over 10% a year. We've already seen promising results from some of our portfolio initiatives, evidenced by a 7% increase in revenue per unit case versus 2019 and so we're looking forward to the longer-term value creation opportunities that this market offers as we continue to reshape our route to market to be fit for purpose. So let me move on to guidance for full year 2023, which now reflects our view of the current market conditions.We expect revenue growth of 6% to 8% and COGS per unit case growth of approximately 8% both of which I'll talk to more on the following slide. With our continued focus on OpEx management, we will look to deliver operating profit growth of 6% to 7%. From a phasing perspective, we anticipate low single-digit operating profit growth in the first half, reflecting the COGS per unit case comp. Please note that these growth rates are all provided on an FX-neutral basis. And whilst too early to provide specific FX guidance, for modeling purposes, we do expect to see a translational FX headwind on for the year at current rates. We will, of course, continue to update you as the year progresses. On interest, we do expect a small increase versus 2022, given the impact of higher rates on our floating note exposure at around 10% of our debt, as well as the loss of interest income associated with the net cash outflow from the Indonesia minority buyout.As I referred to last year, we do anticipate an upward trend on our effective tax rate driven by known tax rate increases. We, therefore, expect our ETR to increase to around 23% this year, with the U.K. tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective from April this year, being the main driver. We will continue to update you on our expected ETR, including our assessment of any uncertain tax positions as the year progresses. We will continue to maintain our progressive dividend payout ratio of approximately 50%. And finally, we expect to deliver free cash flow of at least €1.6 billion after our capital expenditures, which this year are expected to be in the range of 4% to 5% of revenue, excluding lease payments. So let me now provide a bit more color on our revenue and COGS guidance.First to revenue. In terms of shape, revenue growth will be mainly price mix-led, driven by our anticipated headline price increases in 2023, combined with the annualized impact of last year's second round of pricing. We will also continue to focus on driving promotional efficiency, all of which will help us to offset some of the inflationary pressures that we are still seeing across the industry. Our main priority is to remain affordable and relevant to the consumer and as such, we continue to manage the business for the longer term with overall realized pricing tracking below inflation to date. We have great brands, which our consumers love and on the back of ongoing investment and innovation in brands, product and packaging, our category and brands continue to support a solid growth platform for all our customers.The NARTD category remains resilient to date. Ultimately, we believe we can at least maintain or grow our share of the category, led by our great brands and best-in-class capabilities and execution, all underpinning our guidance of 6% to 8% revenue growth this year, and our customers will continue to share in our success, too. We've made structural changes to our business in recent years, which has positioned us more favorably from a volatile macroeconomic environment. As you know, approximately 40% of our volumes come from the more inelastic away-from-home channel, which is naturally somewhat more resilient in challenging times. And in the home channel, we've made bold strategic decisions in recent years, targeting value over volume and improving the underlying profitability of the channel.We've step changed our recommended price pack architecture to address different consumer needs and now confidently play across a spectrum of package formats and recommended price points. We also continue to actively manage our headline pricing and optimize our promotions through smart RGM. So we feel good about our category and our leadership position within it. And despite what we see as a very dynamic external environment, recent trading has not indicated any significant changes in the underlying consumer demand. Moving now to COGS. And clearly, these comments are based on what we know today. We expect COGS per unit case to increase by approximately 8% weighted more to the first half given the comps from last year as previously disclosed.This reflects higher concentrate costs tied to our revenue per unit rate growth, which as we mentioned earlier, will be the main driver of revenue growth this year. You'll notice on this chart that concentrate now accounts for approximately 45% of our total COGS versus the 50% previously indicated, given the inflationary pressures we saw in 2022 through the commodities line. We now anticipate commodity inflation of approximately 10% versus mid-teens previously communicated as we've seen some respite in spot prices for certain raw materials such as aluminum. That said, our indirect exposure to the higher energy and transport costs continue to drive inflation through our conversion cost line, accounting for approximately half of our total commodities exposure.From a hedging perspective, I'm pleased to say that we're now approximately 85% hedged for 2023 and approximately 45% for 2024. Of course, we will continue to see other inflationary pressures within COGS such as labor, gas and power, mainly through the manufacturing line. Clearly, all this guidance is based on what we know today, given that there is still some volatility, particularly in our indirect non-hedged commodity exposure, we will continue to update you as the year progresses. And on that note, I'll pass back to Damian, who will share a bit more on what you can expect from our portfolio this year. Damian?Damian Gammell: Thank you, Nik. And indeed, we have plenty to look forward to with some great plans in place with all our brand partners. We will continue to invest in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar with some fantastic activation plan around the FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. In Flavors, we'll continue the excitement with What The Fanta, launch Kirks Orange in Australia, and refresh Sprite across Europe with a new irresistible taste. And our smooth campaign will drive consumers to try our great tasting Costa ready-to-drink range. Innovation will continue to be a core driver of our growth in energy. We will launch even more flavor extensions and the first ever energy coffee offering in Australia with Monster Java Loca Moca and Mean Bean.And of course, we're extremely excited to be launching our Jack &amp; Coke assortment in GB, Spain and the Netherlands. Hopefully, many of you are able to sample this at our recent Capital Markets event. If not, watch out, it will be here soon. Before we close, I wanted to take this opportunity to recap the new objectives we set as part of our capital markets event in November. We have a lot to do. But as we build on our current momentum, I'm confident that we have the right strategy to deliver on these ambitious targets. So finally, to recap our key messages. 2022 was another successful year for CCEP, with strong revenue growth, share gains and further value creation for our customers. This, alongside our continued focus on driving efficiencies, drove solid bottom line growth and free cash flow, enabling us to pay a record dividend to our shareholders.Importantly, we continue to accelerate our sustainability investments and invest in our ongoing digital transformation. We are operating in a dynamic environment, but as the leader in what is a resilient and growing category, we are confident in our plans for 2023 and are firmly committed to our ambitious midterm objectives. And of course, the foundation of success is great alignment and partnership we have with the Coca-Cola Company and our other brand partners. So to close, I'd like to once again thank all of my colleagues at CCEP, can rightly be very proud of what we all achieved in 2022. So thank you very much, Nik and I will now be happy to take your questions. Over to you all.See also 11 Best CBD Stocks To Buy Now and 25 Fastest Cars in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read the 5 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023.When things get rough for Wall Street, many smart investors turn towards safe dividend stocks. Such companies, known to have experience in navigating market downturns, pay regular dividends. A market report provided by ProShares stated that the S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18%, while the Russell 2000 Index fell by more than 20% this past year. On the other hand, dividend stocks remained much more favorable and rewarded investors with strong, stable returns, outperforming both non-dividend stocks and bonds.Additionally, Hartford Funds states that dividends have played a significant role in the returns investors have received during the past half century, as 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index can be attributed to reinvested dividends since 1960, while the contribution of dividend incomes to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index averaged 40% till 2021.Companies with long histories of annual dividend growth are known to have positive performance over time. When a firm manages to raise its dividend year after year, through recession, war, market crashes and more, it's making a powerful statement about both its financial resilience and its commitment to shareholders. In that regard, companies that have consistently raised their dividends, including AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson, and Company (NYSE:BDX), can provide investors some peace of mind.15 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023Our MethodologyWe scoured the lists of Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings stocks and picked the ones that have the highest number of hedge fund investors.

A notable Dividend Aristocrat, the company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share for a dividend yield of 9.75%, as of February 14.Earlier this January, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar assumed coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with a Buy rating with a price target of $82, down from $86. Although the analyst admits that the stock is trading at a slight premium to its large-cap peers, he believes that the company's ""fixed plus variable"" dividend is both ""sustainable and differentiated, which merits the premium valuation.""According to hedge fund sentiment, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is one of the safest dividend stocks to invest in.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”12. Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.50%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), also known simply as BD, is an American multinational medical technology company that manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents.

The company's systemwide sales rose 5% on a year-over-year basis, while its global comparable sales rose 10.9% year-over-year in 2022.

The collective value of these stakes is $1.8 billion. With over 2 million shares, Bridgewater Associates was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3.10.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has paid uninterrupted dividends on its common stock since 1895 and has increased payments to common shareholders every year for 60 years.On January 30, Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian upgraded Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to Overweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $82. The top household products pick at Morgan Stanley on account of its robust pricing power, strong pet trends and positive corporate strategy changes, Mohsenian states that the near 10% pullback in shares over the last month offers a buying opportunity ""into a structurally attractive name."" Additionally, he believes that the company's conservative 2023 earnings guidance should allow it to beat lowered consensus forecasts.According to our Q3 2022 data, 57 of the 920 hedge funds surveyed by Insider Monkey had invested in the company. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)’s largest investor. It owns 11.5 million shares that are worth $811 million.Third Point made the following comment about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 2.90%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company also manufactures, sells, and markets other non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. The beverage company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 61 years. It currently offers a per-share dividend of $0.46 every quarter with a dividend yield of 2.90%, as of February 14.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 from $68 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the company's ""robust"" 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company's 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was the leading stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Q3 2022. Overall, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned investments in the company in Q3, worth over $25 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 4.75%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is an American alternative investment management company based in New York City whose private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyouts in the last three decades. Blackstone, Inc. (NYSE:BX) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.91 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.75%, as recorded on February 14.On January 27, BMO Capital analyst Rufus Hone raised the price target on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) to $92 from $85 but maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited the company's Q4 earnings beat and noted that Blackstone is incrementally positive around the outlook for Retail inflows recovering, and should benefit from any ""soft landing"" economic outcome.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds were bullish on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assets We recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team. Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”7. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois, United States. The company is known for its diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition products, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Among Abbott's most well-known brands are Pedialyte, Ensure, Similac, and Glucerna.On January 26, Stifel analyst Rick Wise raised his price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares, telling investors that the company's management had ""an encouragingly positive tone to start 2023"" on its earnings call. He adds that, with Abbott starting off with high-single-digit organic sales growth guidance and $4.30-$4.50 EPS guidance that ""basically brackets current consensus,"" the 2023 setup ""also appears encouraging.""Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.92%, as of February 14. The company has a run of 51 years of consistent dividend growth.At the end of September, 62 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), up from 61 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $3 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 1.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas.On February 15, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to $180 from $175 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst raised his estimates on prospects of better sales trends and the likelihood of solid store traffic trends, particularly in January.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share for a dividend yield of 1.54%. A household name in the world of finance, the company is one of safest dividend stocks as it maintains a 49-year streak of consistent dividend growth.As of the end of Q3 2022, 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), compared with 67 in the previous quarter. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4.08 billion.With decades of consistent dividend growth, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) joins the likes of AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) on our list of the safest dividend stocks for 2023.Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Safe Dividend Stocks For 2023.  Suggested articles:15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This MonthDisclosure.

In general, rising inflation and interest rates have been major headwinds for most parts of the economy. Energy, however, tends to thrive in this sort of situation. Inflation tends to coincide with higher energy prices. And energy companies, with their massive cash flows, typically don’t have to worry about interest rates or Central Bank actions too much either.However, oil and natural gas prices have cooled off in recent months. Oil has slipped back well below the $100 mark, while natural gas prices have plunged amid an unusually warm winter.This oil and gas rally pause marks a great entry point for energy stocks. After all, inflation is still hot, and geopolitical problems in Russia and elsewhere will continue to curtail the global oil and gas supply. That all adds to these seven energy stocks being primed to outperform in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceBPBP$40.59XOMExxon Mobil$115.27CVXChevron$168.71VLOValero Energy$137.55YPFYPF$11.66ECEcopetrol$10.52CHXChampionX$31.52BP (BP)The BP (BP) logo on a sign against a blue sky with cloudsSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comRegarding energy stocks, few are hotter than BP (NYSE:BP) right now. The company reported earnings last week, and shares jumped 15% in the days following those results.BP announced massive profits, but that’s not too surprising. What really set off the excitement was BP’s corporate pivot. Historically, BP had been one of the firms that had been quickest to adopt green and renewable energy alternatives. However, as a recent report suggested, BP’s CEO had become discouraged by low returns on the firm’s green investments.Instead, BP announced in this earnings report that it would be scaling back its low-carbon investments. In its place, the company will return more capital to shareholders, particularly by boosting the firm’s buyback program.Story continuesBP stock has moved to new 52-week highs on this news. Despite that, shares are still cheap, as BP had been badly out-of-favor with investors during its renewable energy phase. Today, shares still go for just six times forward earnings while offering a 3.9% dividend yield. And, with a large buyback on the way, that should only boost earnings going forward.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world’s largest oil companies. It has achieved this by operating on a generational timescale. ExxonMobil puts capital to work on a decades-long basis and consistently underwrites new projects when others are shying away. This contrarian streak, for example, showed itself in the late 2010s when Exxon Mobil kept investing in its huge offshore Guyana field even as other rivals slashed new oil &amp; gas production spending.Once the price of oil surged again in 2021, the successful Guyana bet put Exxon Mobil in the driver’s seat among major international oil producers. Guyana has become one of the world’s fast-growing economies, and ExxonMobil has played a key part in that.Shareholders have been amply rewarded. XOM stock has nearly quadrupled since its 2020 lows, and shares hit fresh all-time highs in February. Not bad for a company whose roots go back to 1870. Even after the huge run-up, shares go for just 11 times forward earnings. In addition, thanks to being an integrated major, Exxon has a variety of other assets in refining, chemicals, and so on, which reduce oil price-related risk.Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has also been on a winning streak. Shares have moved to fresh all-time highs amid record profits and a stunning $75 billion new share repurchase program.Chevron’s strength comes from its massive production base. It has production facilities on every continent on Earth except Antarctica. The company produces more than 3 million barrels of oil and equivalents every day.In recent years, Chevron has put a lot of money into working in liquefied natural gas (LNG). This technology allows Chevron to produce gas in remote parts of the world and ship it to markets with higher demand and prices. This has proven invaluable over the past year as Europe has rushed to import LNG to replace its gas supplies from Russia.Chevron currently has a market capitalization of $330 billion. This means that the current $75 billion share repurchase program would buy up more than 20% of the entire company based on today’s share price. That program, in addition to a reasonable starting valuation and a 3.5% dividend yield, should give investors strong returns.Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is America’s largest independent refining company. Refining has historically been a cyclical boom and bust-market with limited profitability. Investors understandably gave refining stocks low valuation multiples.However, times have changed. Refining, within North America at least, has become far more profitable. That is due to fracking. The oil production rise in the American heartland has given the refining industry more inputs. Meanwhile, thanks to limited amounts of new pipelines and export capacity, America has ended up with a glut of crude oil. This has amounted to refiners earning much higher profit margins on their sales of gasoline, jet fuel, asphalt, and so on than they used to.In addition, refining has become a scarce asset. Environmentalists and government regulation have made it nearly impossible to build new refineries, making existing ones more valuable due to the lack of new competition. This is to say that refining stocks should be worth a lot more than they used to be.And yet, investors seem to be skeptical. Valero is currently trading for just six times forward earnings. The company has also, impressively, quadrupled its dividend over the past decade, and shares yield 3%. Refiners, including Valero, are earning record profits, and yet their shares still seem to be underappreciated on Wall Street. With refining margins surging again to start 2023, VLO stock price should follow.YPF (YPF)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comYPF (NYSE:YPF) is Argentina’s large state-managed oil company. After years of struggling, YPF has enjoyed a revival recently. Indeed, as YPF’s recent corporate presentation announced: “We are back.” YPF stock has soared from $3 to $12 since last summer, putting some numbers behind that sentiment.YPF’s name to claim is its shale reserves. The firm’s Vaca Muerta shale field in Argentina amounts to one of the world’s largest easily-developable shale fields in the world. In addition to the company’s world-class oil reserves, it also has extensive pipelines and natural gas operations. This gives the firm diversity and reduces its risk if oil prices drop.YPF shares are up nearly 200% over the past year. Even so, the stock is astonishingly cheap. YPF will have earned just shy of $5 a share in 2022, meaning that the stock is going for 2.4 times earnings. Incredible stuff.Yes, the company is Argentine and comes with the political risk associated with assets in that country. Even so, a large energy firm with a diversified business model and massive shale reserves deserves to trade for a much higher P/E ratio.Ecopetrol (EC)Close up empty Petrol, gasoline gauge dash board in car with digital warning sign of run out of fuel turn on on black background. Low level of fuel show on speedometer dashboard.Source: ShutterstockA common theme of the energy sector is that shares have already appreciated sharply over the last year as conditions have improved. However, one company bucks that trend. That’s Ecopetrol (NYSE:EC). EC stock has been roughly flat over the past six months and is actually down 20% over the past year.However, while the share price doesn’t reflect it yet, Ecopetrol’s business is firing on all cylinders. The company generated $7 billion in net income over the past year and produced its highest earnings per share figure since 2013. As Ecopetrol’s market capitalization is just $22 billion, this means that the company is going for just three times earnings. Adding to the excitement, shares currently offer a dividend yield of 21%. That’s not a misprint.So what’s the deal? Political risk. Ecopetrol, after all, is the state-run oil company of Colombia. Colombia elected a left-wing president last year, and investors have assumed that he will damage the company’s operations.What these foreign investors might not realize, however, is that since the government controls the majority of Ecopetrol’s stock, the government relies on said 21% dividend yield to fund its operations. Indeed, since taking office, the new administration has cracked down on private-sector oil companies, while state-managed Ecopetrol has boosted its investments.Long story short, Ecopetrol is generating record profits and returning the lion’s share to its shareholders (primarily the Colombian government) via a massive dividend. Thanks to investor confusion over new government policy, Ecopetrol shares are available at a massive discount to most other energy companies today.ChampionX (CHX)the ChampionX logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comChampionX (NYSE:CHX) is an energy services company that came about from the merger of Apergy with Ecolab’s (NYSE:ECL) upstream energy business.The company today offers a wide variety of services to energy companies. ChampionX can provide production chemicals, well construction and completion, gas lift, mining, construction tools, and so on.

To skip our detailed analysis of annuities and the insurance sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Annuity Companies in the US.Within the world of insurance companies, annuities are a more specialized concept. These are contracts between clients and insurance companies that require the insurer to make payments to the customer immediately or in the future. An annuity can be bought either by making a single payment or by making a series of payments spread out over a few years. There are four main types of annuities: immediate, deferred, fixed, and variable. Annuity companies' customers can thus pick their preferred type of annuity depending on when they want to start receiving their annuity payments and how they would like for their annuity to be invested.  As of November 2022, AM Best, a top credit rating agency, maintains a Stable outlook for the US life/annuity segment. This signifies the strength and resilience of annuity companies in the US over the past year, showing why they are in focus today.For most people, their interaction with the concept of insurance begins with traditional insurance companies such as Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL). Annuity companies are also part of the insurance industry and have been benefitting over the past couple of years due to a range of factors. According to AM Best's market segment report on the annuity segment, published in November 2022, these include cost savings and a pandemic-driven acceleration in product and systems modernization. The Stable outlook for the annuities segment is helped by annuity companies' solid capital management and record sales growth. Even though the annuities segment saw earnings volatility in 2022, capital markets gains and diversified earnings enabled the segment to offset the mortality impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Story continuesOn sales growth, the report noted that annuity sales have managed to steadily rise in 2022. In the second quarter, they increased by 22% to $77.5 billion. This was the highest quarterly sales figure recorded for the annuities segment and was made possible by ongoing equity market declines and rising interest rates. For fixed-rate, deferred annuities, sales growth was recorded at 76%, while for fixed-index annuities, sales growth was recorded at 19%, in comparison with the second quarter of 2021. Even generally, the insurance industry benefitted from a renewed interest in life insurance in 2022. New life insurance annualized premiums increased by 17% in the first quarter of 2022, making this quarter the fifth-consecutive quarter of double-digit premium growth for life insurance. As such, annuity companies are expected to continue their upwards trend in 2023, with higher sales growth than ever before.Best Annuity Companies In the USSource:unsplashLet's now take a look at the 10 best annuity companies in the US.Our MethodologyTo create our list of the best annuity companies below, we have relied on two metrics: AM Best's ratings demonstrating the financial strength of these companies and the fixed annuity rates offered by them as of January 2023.

The goal of advertising is to reach a large audience, increase brand awareness, and establish credibility with the audience. The specific messages that are used to promote a product, service or idea in advertising are referred to as advertisements, commonly known as ""ads"". It is the responsibility of a certain business, to be honest, and transparent in its advertising campaigns.

A business should be creative when it comes to creating ads to get more reach and conversion for its product or service. Budgeting and innovation are the keys for an advertising company to meet their goals. Advertising can be presented through a variety of mediums, such as television and radio commercials, print ads in newspapers and magazines, online banners and sponsored content, billboards, and even the placement of products in movies or television programs.

Consumer goods makers weigh bets on buyer strength,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-raise-prices-not-consumer-110423405.html,1676891063,STORY,"['WMT', 'TSCO.L', 'KHC', 'PEP']","[By Jessica DiNapoli(Reuters) - Prices of everyday basics like Bounty paper towels and Cadbury chocolate may rise again this year while those of others like Clorox Co wipes and Diet Pepsi are likely to remain steady, as manufacturers make differing bets on the strength of the consumer and their brands.Goods makers' strategies on further price hikes depends on their leverage with retailers such as Walmart Inc and Tesco plc, who are pushing back against more increases in an uncertain economic environment.Once-in-a-generation levels of inflation, stemming from pandemic supply chain snarls, government stimulus and the Ukraine war, have pinched shoppers' pocketbooks globally.The decision by companies to boost prices is hitting demand at big-box retailers like Walmart and Home Depot, both of which said Tuesday that inflation will result in worse earnings results for 2023 than previously expected.In Britain, consumers paid 16.7% more for food in the month to Jan. 22 compared to the same period last year, while U.S. prices for food eaten at and away from home rose 10.1% in the 12 months ended in January.There are small signs the pressure is easing, with U.S. consumer prices a month earlier declining for the first time in two-and-a-half years, due in part to gas prices.""While the supply chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high,"" said John Rainey, Walmart chief financial officer, during a call with analysts Tuesday. ""There is considerable pressure on the consumer.""As the ""tide is turning a little bit,"" some retailers are also now asking suppliers for ""rollbacks"" as the cost of fuel, for example, falls, another factor driving companies' decisions, said KPMG consultant Sunder Ramakrishnan.""The retailer would drop the shelf price, because manufacturers agree to sell it for less to the retailer,"" Ramakrishnan said. ""It's been a fairly recent phenomenon. Not a lot of manufacturers are willing to volunteer to cut price.""Story continuesThe cost of cardboard cases has decreased by as much as 50%, and transportation costs have plummeted as well, by 25-30%, Reuters reported last week. Some plastics and chemicals used in household goods have risen, executives have said, and labor remains costly.""I'm frustrated by pricing,"" General Mills Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Harmening said Tuesday at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York's conference in Boca Raton, Florida. ""I'm sure our customers are too. I'm sure consumers are too, but that's the environment that we're living in.""DIFFERENT PREDICTIONSAfter more than a year of consistent price hikes, some consumer goods makers such as Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese manufacturer Kraft Heinz Co are pressing pause as they weigh consumer demand for their items.Kraft's prices went up 13.2 percentage points in 2022 over the prior year, according to financial disclosures. Kroger Co is promoting a 20-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup for $2.49 - below the $3.18 average price per unit of the condiment according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm.Kraft-Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio said last week that private label, or store brands, are gaining market share, mainly from the company's competitors.It's riskier for national brands to hike prices on products where consumers are increasingly buying store brand items, such as grocery and baby products, according to market research firm Numerator.But other companies like Nestle SA, the world's biggest food company, continue to plan price hikes in the future to recoup margins squeezed by high labor and fuel costs, a whiplash for consumers aiming to make sense of their household expenses.Prices on Nestle's products including Coffee Mate creamers already rose 8.2% last year, with an 11.75 ounce package of its Stouffer's French bread pizza selling for $3.48 at Walmart. Frozen pizza prices have risen about 14% in the last year, according to IRI data.""Consumer sensitivity to prices is going up, even in the last couple months,"" said Mark Hosbein, an executive at consulting firm Magid.Magid's data from surveys shows that consumers are spending dramatically more on groceries, rent and gas, forcing them to cut back on savings and eat out less. Magid's data also shows shoppers are opting for cheaper items.BIG BRANDS DIFFERBrands that retailers and consumers see ""core"" or ""very strong"" in their segment also have more pricing power, Ramakrishnan said, because they help build sales for chains.Coca-Cola Co's CEO James Quincey, for example, said on Tuesday the company had ""earned the right"" to push price hikes on to consumers because its classic Coke and Fanta sodas lead the beverage category.Executives at Bounty maker Procter &amp; Gamble Co said the company was confident the U.S. consumer ""is going to hold up well"" over the next few quarters, and planning more increases. A 16-ounce bottle of P&amp;G's Dawn Powerwash dish soap costs $5.99 on Target.com, after debuting at $4.99 about three years ago according to media reports.""Retailers cannot truly push back on prices … if the company has an important brand,"" Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said.The average prices consumers are paying for Kraft-Heinz and PepsiCo Inc products have risen faster than Nestle's, another reason why both Kraft-Heinz and PepsiCo may be holding off on hikes for now.PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta has said he expects shoppers to become more price-sensitive later in the year due to fears of a recession in the United States, its major market.Packaged food companies drastically hiked prices in 2022 https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CONSUMER-GOODS-PRICES/dwpkdexomvm/chart.png(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York and Aishwarya Venugopal and Mehr Bedi in Bengaluru; additional reporting from Siddharth Cavale in New York, editing by Deepa Babington)]"

All after the train derailments in Ohio, for example, which released toxic chemicals. In fact, it’s accidents like this that are raising concerns about the quality of U.S. infrastructure quality, which could lead to big requests for new funding. So far, the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill was passed in 2021 to fix infrastructure-related problems in the coming years. With infrastructure back in the spotlight, we will likely see even more investments in America’s infrastructure over the coming years. That being said, I believe these three infrastructure stocks will make the most of it when that happens:UNPUnion Pacific$202.74CSLCarlisle Companies$260.79LPXLouisiana-Pacific$65.75Infrastructure Stocks: Union Pacific (UNP)Railroad tracks with a junctionSource: ShutterstockWith the focus on rail, investors should not ignore Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP)—America’s largest rail pure-play company with the second largest rail network at 32,000 miles. Union Pacific is among the least risky company you can invest in, as the company has a robust share repurchase program and generates significant amounts of cash. Last year, operating cash was $9.4 billion, and the company spent $6.3 billion in share buybacks. Union Pacific’s 2.56% annual dividend is the icing on top, on which it spent $3.2 billion.The company’s extensive rail network also means that the government is providing substantial subsidies. The company called the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill a “big win,” and I’m sure that more big wins will come in the future as only $66 billion of the bill is allocated to rail, a majority of which is for passenger rail.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFurthermore, Union Pacific is an important company for the U.S. economy. A third of all U.S. exports are also freight-related, and freight companies not only boost the economy and create a lot of jobs but also save taxpayers money by investing an average of $20 billion per year on their own infrastructure. With that in mind, I see UNP stock as a safe haven with considerable long-term potential.Story continuesInfrastructure Stocks: Carlisle Companies (CSL)a highway interchange as viewed from aboveSource: ShutterstockCarlisle Companies (NYSE:CSL) is a diversified manufacturer that produces diverse products in various industries, including construction, aerospace, and defense. The company’s construction materials segment is particularly well-positioned to benefit from the infrastructure plan, which includes investments in roads, bridges, and other public works.This company may not directly get subsidies from the government. But up-and-coming infrastructure-related projects will give Carlisle Companies a big boost. For example, the government will spend $55 billion on expanding clean water access for Americans and $50 billion on disaster-proofing. Carlisle makes the necessary niche equipment for both of these instances. Furthermore, government-subsidized construction projects will also bring massive demand for the company’s products in the future.Finally, Carlisle’s financials are very robust and has been beating estimates by a large margin. Annual profits more than doubled last year, while its net margin grew by 31.5% year-on-year in Q4. These metrics, combined with the infrastructure catalyst, make CSL a surefire stock in my book.Infrastructure Stocks: Louisiana-Pacific (LPX)Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukOne of the infrastructure stocks that recently caught my eye is Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX), after Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B) increased its positions in LPX by 21.5% in its Q4 13F filing. This company does have a very low valuation, but its poor financial performance is why I never gave LPX a second thought until now. The company is a leading building materials manufacturer focusing on the housing industry. As the Biden administration moves forward with its infrastructure plan, the housing market is expected to see a significant boost, which could translate to solid growth for Louisiana-Pacific.The company’s top line went through a substantial expansion in 2021 as a booming economy added significant demand for housing. However, as growth has slowed, Louisiana-Pacific is struggling to compete with its 2021 metrics, hence the poor year-on-year financial outlook. However, I believe that in the long run, Louisiana-Pacific can roar back as the economy recovers. It’s a risky bet, but the current entry point is excellent once the growth premium returns. The Altman-Z score of the company also suggests no bankruptcy risk.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

142,ad847a8d-3e55-368e-91df-36b4f6f36aa1,CSCO,2023-02-20,Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-nasdaq-csco-stock-110039018.html,1676890839,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Low-cost index funds make it easy to achieve average market returns. But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. That's what has happened with the Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) share price. It's up 15% over three years, but that is below the market return. Unfortunately, the share price has fallen 11% over twelve months.Since it's been a strong week for Cisco Systems shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Cisco Systems achieved compound earnings per share growth of 2.1% per year. In comparison, the 5% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Cisco Systems' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Cisco Systems' TSR for the last 3 years was 27%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Cisco Systems shareholders are down 8.3% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.7%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 5%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Is Cisco Systems cheap compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Of course Cisco Systems may not be the best stock to buy.
