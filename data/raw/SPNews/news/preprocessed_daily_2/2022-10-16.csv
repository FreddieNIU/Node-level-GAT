And last Friday, he made his intentions clear: ‘I do think it’s time to taper.’ – Moonshot Investor, Oct. 27By December, I would urge investors to sell their meme coins and then get out of crypto the following May. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is still down 35% from that call.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s because some economic cycles are straightforward to forecast.High inflation? You can be sure central banks will raise interest rates to slow the pace. Unemployment out of control? Vote-hungry legislators will be pushing stimulus bills before you can finish this sentence.In other words, most developed economies follow a boom-bust cycle as predictable as tides going in and out. Cryptocurrencies, bonds and other rate-sensitive assets tend to follow suit.Meanwhile, predicting the movement of individual stocks is a far more challenging task. My No. 2 stock pick for 2022 doubled within two months, while my No. 1 pick dropped 60%. Unlike the economic tides that rise and fall, individual companies can surge to dominance……or disappear off the face of the earth.It’s the difference between predicting the average tide for a day (i.e., economic cycles) or the size of each wave (i.e., individual stocks).10 Top Stock Market Predictions for 2023Nevertheless, picking stocks and predicting markets go hand in hand. No amount of macroeconomic insight is helpful to investors unless it helps us understand what we should do next. And fortunately, 2023 is shaping up to become a year where predictable macroeconomic forces are back in the driver’s seat.Prediction 1: An Aggressive Fed Gets Inflation Under ControlRising rates will likely trigger a recession this year, according to data models by the Conference Board, a non-partisan think tank. They now predict a 96% likelihood of a U.S. recession within the next 12 months.Story continuesThat’s oddly good news for inflation hawks. In every recession until the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, economic slowdowns have been linked with softening demand and lower prices. The pattern was only broken in 2020 when massive fiscal stimulus offset the severe downturn caused by pandemic-induced lockdowns.A graph of US consumer price inflation historySource: Chart by InvestorPlaceIn 2023, a recession will help bring inflation back under control.Demand for goods is already slipping. Henry Hub gas prices – a key indicator of industrial production – dropped from their $8.81 record in August to $7.88 in September. And on the consumer side, prices of big-ticket items are also showing weakness. The Manheim used vehicle value index is now down 13% from the start of the year, while housing transactions have slowed.Most importantly, the U.S. government has avoided the temptation of unleashing fiscal stimulus. Last week, President Joe Biden quietly scaled back significant portions of student debt relief. And high gas prices have been met with increased drilling permits and attempted Middle East diplomacy rather than the energy subsidies the U.K. and E.U. have pursued. The White House has briefly put the practicalities of inflation ahead of ideology for now.Several structural issues will remain through 2023. Cutbacks in OPEC+ production threaten to keep oil prices aloft. A severe housing shortage should keep real estate tight. But naysayers of the Fed aren’t giving Jerome Powell or the White House enough credit — with both monetary and fiscal policy temporarily working in the same direction, 2023 will be the year inflation gets back under control.Prediction 2: The Dow Jones Hobbles Back Above 33,000Signs are also emerging that America will escape a prolonged recession in 2023. On Friday, the Labor Department revealed that unemployment had fallen to 3.5%, a strong signal of economic health. And job openings remain relatively high – a factor that has helped keep the “shadow” U.S. unemployment rate relatively stable.A graph of shadow us unemployment rate through October 2022Source: Chart by InvestorPlace“Companies suffering from worker shortages have little fat to trim,” notes the Economist. “This resilience is to be welcomed. It implies that a recession, if one arrives, is likely to be mild.” A strong dollar will only help buffer the U.S. economy against significant declines.That will likely keep the Dow Jones Index (DJIA) in positive territory next year. The median company in the Dow Jones now trades for 18.8x price-to-earnings (P/E), a significant discount to its 5-year average of 21.8x. That suggests the Dow Jones could reach 35,650 if markets return to normal.But I’m tempering my expectations, at least for now. Of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones, only 17 will increase earnings per share (EPS) by more than inflation, according to Wall Street analysts. And the big winners in the index – including Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) — will unlikely repeat their strong performance beyond 2023.The U.S. also risks major supply-side shocks. On Monday, the Biden administration implemented sweeping new restrictions on chip exports to China – a move designed to slow Chinese development of advanced technologies. The action came less than a month after the White House reaffirmed the President Donald Trump-era tariffs on its economic rival.These trade barriers could trigger tit-for-tat restrictions, particularly in high-value tech exports like solar panels and electronics. China could also restrict U.S. sales of anything from Apple iPhones to Nike shoes.Barring such escalation, 2023 will likely shape up as a year where low-volatility firms inch higher and the U.S. sidesteps a significant recession.Prediction 3: Hypergrowth Stocks SoarAll this creates a “goldilocks” situation for high-growth stocks. The slowing pace of rate hikes, coupled with a relatively mild recession, means that demand for higher-risk assets will rise sooner than expected.History creates room for optimism. According to a study by CFRA Research, the S&amp;P 500 typically rises 17% in the 12 months after a recession, compared to a 1% loss in the year before. Post-recession periods turn out to be some of the best moments to buy.The rebound effect is particularly notable with cyclical companies, a sector of high-beta stocks. A study by Fidelity found that shares in the consumer discretionary sector bested the average stock market by 12% in early cycle recoveries since 1962 with a 100% hit rate.Today, investors can find these opportunities in higher-risk startups like Desktop Metal (NYSE:DM) and Ginkgo Bioworks (NYSE:DNA) that trade near their liquidation value. Markets currently value Desktop Metal’s equity at $800 million, only 40% higher than the value of its ExOne acquisition in 2021. The value of DM’s patents and assets is likely worth over $1 billion, a fact that Wall Street analysts highlight with their $3.76 price target.Ginkgo’s upside is even higher, given the company’s intellectual property (IP) in synthetic biology. Shares have a 145% upside, according to Wall Street.In 2023, these companies will spring back to their intrinsic values as the Fed slows the pace of rate hikes.Prediction 4: Finance Stocks Surprise to the UpsideIn July, I recommended Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), a “sleeper stock quietly beating Robinhood.”“At first glance, Charles Schwab might seem like an ordinary brokerage business… Instead, Charles Schwab makes the [Profit &amp; Protection buy] list because it’s quietly become one of America’s largest and best-run banks… Rising interest rates will boost Schwab’s revenue without causing additional costs.”Shares have since risen 16%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by over a fifth.In 2023, shares of financial companies will continue to rise. Banks earn income from net interest margin (NIM), and rising rates tend to increase the spread. For every 1% that rates rise, Schwab will earn around 6.2% more in NIMs.Operationally leveraged firms will gain even more. At online bank startup SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI), each additional NIM dollar raises operating income by $2.33 because of the fintech’s relatively high fixed costs.That’s good news for investors in firms like SoFi. The company has little direct exposure to mortgages and a stock price that now borders on its liquidation value. The San Francisco-based firm trades at a price-to-book of less than 1, giving it potential 5X upside.A graph of sofi technologies price-to-book value through October 2022Source: Chart by InvestorPlaceIt won’t be a smooth ride. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will see earnings drop by around 43% as deals dry up, according to consensus estimates. And slowing economies are generally bad news for banks, which depend on the strength of their underlying economy.But for investors with higher risk appetite, finance stocks like SoFi and Charles Schwab will surprise to the upside in 2023Prediction 5: Lithium Stocks DominateIn January, analysts at Goldman Sachs warned that lithium supply could triple by 2025. The oversupply, it forecast, would cause prices to crater to $11,000.Less than a year later, such predictions have been upended. In August, California moved to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Many states like Massachusetts, which link their emission standards to the Golden State’s, will automatically follow suit.These regulations have turned supply-demand forecasts on their head. The International Energy Agency now projects demand by 2025 will be 25% higher from announced EV pledges. By 2030, that gap could widen to almost 60%. Lithium now trades at record highs.Several companies stand to gain. Of the blue-chip players, established firms like Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM), the world’s largest supplier of lithium, will benefit from high prices. Analysts are already calling for earnings per share (EPS) to top $13.3 in 2023, up from $2.05 in 2021.On the other end, startups like Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) could see even more significant gains. These companies have multiple projects under development and trade at a significant discount for regulatory uncertainty. LAC’s Nevada-based Thacker Pass project has been in legal limbo for years, despite receiving mining permits from both the Trump and Biden administrations. A severe lithium metal shortage will pressure state governments to concede on mining restrictions. Stocks like Lithium Americas could rise 200%.Prediction 6: Ethereum Crushes the CompetitionIn 2021, I predicted that Ethereum (ETH-USD) would dominate the tokenization space.It’s hard to know which tokens will win. In the carbon credit space, CO2, UPCO2 and MintCarbon are all competing for the same prize, but all three could wind up losing anyway.However, I can tell you one cryptocurrency that’s sure to be a winner:Ethereum.The ‘picks and shovels’ play of tokenization now supports 97% of all NFT transactions, according to Cointelegraph Research…. As we look towards 2022, Ethereum will continue to succeed.Fast forward a year, and Ethereum has indeed maintained its lead in tokenization. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has waved off competition from Solana (SOL-USD) and Flow (FLOW-USD); 75% of NFT transactions remain on the Ethereum blockchain. And in mid-September, the cryptocurrency pulled off a switch to a Proof of Stake protocol with zero downtime. Ethereum transactions now use 99% less energy than they once did.ETH will likely widen its lead in 2023 as funding for rival blockchains dwindle. The value of the Solana Foundation’s approximately 95 million SOL has dropped from an astonishing $24.6 billion in 2021 to $3.1 billion today. And once-promising upstarts like Immutable X (IMX-USD) have failed to live up to their initial hype, starving them of additional fundraising potential.Ethereum isn’t immune to the 2022 crypto winter, either. Weekly NFT sales are down almost 75% from the start of the year, according to The Block. And ETH prices are down 65% year to date. But as the crypto shakeout of 2018 demonstrated, dominant players tend to extend their lead during market drawdowns. 2023 will look no different.Prediction 7: Investors Wait Too Long to BuyFinally, stocks typically bottom out around two months before the end of rate-hike cycles, according to data going back to the 1980s. That pattern suggests that markets will bottom out in Q4 2022, since rates will likely peak in early 2023.Many retail investors, however, will miss jumping back in. According to surveys by the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), negative sentiment hit 61% in September, its highest reading since the 2009 financial crisis. A separate study by VandaTrack found that investors are now less willing to buy the dip after the stock market’s recent underperformance.That means many investors will miss out on once-in-a-decade deals. 42 U.S-listed companies now trade with negative enterprise values, despite having positive free cash flow. Add in all money-losing companies, and 391 American firms receive the dubious award of having enough cash to take themselves private, according to data from Thomson Reuters.2023 will be a phenomenal year for many of these companies… and many investors stand to miss out.Conclusion: 3 Bonus Predictions to WatchRising rates and protectionist economic policy create predictable patterns that markets have seen since the 1950s.Real estate prices sag. Rising mortgage rates and poor affordability will dent home prices in 2023, as they did in the 1991 and 2008 recessions.Semiconductor stocks struggle. Sector insiders have been ringing alarm bells over oversupply since July. Protectionist policy will worsen the glut for American firms.Staples and healthcare stocks underperform. Like in 2002 and other post-recession years, low-beta stocks tend to do worse than their riskier counterparts.Together, that means traditionally “safe” investments will lag.In their place, hypergrowth stocks and riskier plays will steal the show. And though we might not know exactly which stock (or wave) will succeed, it’s becoming clear that the entire tide is ready to come back in.Tom Yeung is a market analyst and portfolio manager of the Omnia Portfolio, the highest-tier subscription at InvestorPlace.

1,8c986ec6-ab0e-3cc4-8893-51cb9781fce7,TXN,2022-10-16,Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after Texas Instruments Incorporated's (NASDAQ:TXN) latest 6.9% drop adds to a year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-adopt-severe-110014936.html,1665918014,STORY,['TXN'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$10.0b. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 22% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Texas Instruments which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Texas Instruments. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Texas Instruments. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Texas Instruments, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Texas Instruments is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.1% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Texas Instruments Incorporated in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$149m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Texas Instruments   (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

4,77e1c447-55d4-3a34-ab70-ba49e458f618,WMT,2022-10-16,An Intrinsic Calculation For Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Suggests It's 31% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-walmart-inc-nyse-130018077.html,1665838818,STORY,['WMT'],"[How far off is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$16.0bUS$15.8bUS$16.6bUS$18.9bUS$20.1bUS$21.0bUS$21.8bUS$22.5bUS$23.2bUS$23.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.49%Est @ 3.74%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.7% US$15.1kUS$14.1kUS$14.0kUS$15.2kUS$15.2kUS$15.1kUS$14.8kUS$14.4kUS$14.0kUS$13.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$146bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (5.7%– 2.0%) = US$647bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$647b÷ ( 1 + 5.7%)10= US$371bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$516b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$130, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walmart as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

7,faa3221e-14d4-3279-91fb-458dbefc3c28,O,2022-10-16,Energy & Precious Metals - Weekly Review and Outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-045444344.html,1665896084,STORY,"['GC=F', 'CL=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- Crude prices fell last week for a fifth week in seven over what analysts said were concerns that U.S. inflation was just not slowing as the Federal Reserve expected, to the extent that it was now affecting consumer sentiment and retail sales as well.That may well be the case but the oil market was clearly not talking about the elephant in the room - i.e. the biggest geopolitical crisis to hit the trade in years, one with ramifications as important to energy as the Russia-Ukraine crisis itself.We’re talking about the OPEC+ oil production cut - the size and, more importantly, timing of it - that has got the White House all miffed.As Jonathan Panikoff, senior member at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, puts it, the decision by the Saudi-steered and Russia-supported oil-producing alliance to reduce output is probably not aimed just at President Joe Biden or the United States.“But the manner in which it’s being implemented probably is - and it has the potential to be politically damaging for both the president and Democrats,” said Panikoff.“The timing of the cuts - to take effect November 1, one week ahead of the US midterm elections - and their intensity, removing up to two million barrels per day from the market, probably reflect a willingness by Saudi Arabia to jab at Biden. Riyadh is not naïve about the US political landscape. OPEC+ almost certainly could have achieved its same overall goal but waited to act until shortly after the US midterms.”That brings us to Panikoff’s analysis of the fundamental problem between the United States and Saudi Arabia: a relation that’s rife with misaligned expectations.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - a.k.a. MbS - continues to demonstrate his preference for global engagement that is transactional, similar to how both China and Russia generally engage in the world. The problem is, that’s not traditionally how Washington conducts foreign policy, preferring long-term strategic relationships.Story continuesMbS surely recognizes the broader global context of his decision-making. Riyadh’s support of the cuts reflects a conscious decision to actively support Moscow at a time when the world knows the United States is working to challenge Russia’s ability to successfully wage war in Ukraine, including by limiting capital available to Moscow from oil sales.Inevitably, Riyadh will claim the cuts are in the best interest of Saudi Arabia, and that may be true. In the short term, a coming global recession might portend greater supply and risk pushing oil prices down further. In the long term, as global energy transitions away from fossil fuels accelerate, Riyadh might think that it only has so many years left of high oil prices to glean the revenue needed to reform its economy.But even if that is Riyadh’s thinking, its behavior indicates a belief that it has nothing to lose on national security by aligning with Russia at this time. It’s true that if the United States makes a hasty and unwise decision to immediately withdraw its security umbrella from Saudi Arabia, Washington risks seeing Beijing fill that gap. On the other hand, Beijing has long been hesitant to play the role of security guarantor, and China cannot completely fill the hardware gap that would exist if the United States left—most prominently for missile defense, a field in which China is still developing its capabilities.Riyadh may sincerely believe that the economic issues associated with oil prices are distinct from the security requirements for which it relies on the United States. But for Washington, economic security is very much core to national security. To that end, MBS needs to be careful. There are limits to how much the Biden administration is going to accept from a country that’s supposed to be a critical ally - even a transactional one.Almost every U.S. president from the 70s to now - that’s Richard Nixon to Joe Biden - have had problems with the kingdom and its love child called OPEC (over the past six years, it’s been OPEC+ after the Saudis’ co-opting of Russia and nine other players into the wider group).Many U.S. commanders-in-chief had vented about the Saudis and the oil cartel, but ultimately did nothing about both.Donald Trump had mixed results though. Despite him and his son-in-law being as chummy as possible with the House of Saud, Trump often waged a gleeful ‘war’ of his own with the cartel through precision-guided drones (tweets) to get oil prices down. The post-Covid collapse of crude prices was, of course, a game changer for Trump, making him contrite enough to lend the combined forces of the Saudis and Russians a helping hand to put the oil market back together again.Enter Biden in January 2022, and nothing has been the same since for the Americans and the Saudis. In fact, almost every month has been progressively worse for diplomatic ties and the supply-demand situation in oil (the president’s “pariah-state” comment against Riyadh over the Jamal Khashoggi killing not helping).Biden’s maiden visit to the Saudi capital in July was unsurprisingly more disastrous, with the president telling MbS on his face, on Saudi soil, that he thought the crown prince was responsible for the killing. Hence, a 500,000 barrels-per-day production cut originally conceived as a “bridge-building” move by the Saudis in response to the visit ended up becoming an insulting 100,000-bpd at MbS’ order.Biden has to realize that he’s not only butting heads with the source of the world’s most critical oil supply. He’s also up against a crown prince and energy minister (the latter being MbS’ half brother, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, or AbS) whose combined egos are probably greater than the dignity of the rest of the Arab world.So, comes the question: What could the White House hope to achieve in a political reset with the Saudis?With the midterm elections just weeks away, it’s hard to think of anything the administration could do at this point - other than to release more oil from the U.S. reserve - to bring crude prices lower.On the contrary, prices could actually rise on the new turmoil that’s being created; though justice-seekers to Saudi extravagance would probably cheer. If MbS thinks it’s alright to give Biden a jab below the belt just before the elections, it’s probably not wrong either for the president to show the crown prince that he indeed has something below that belt to accuse him on his face of murder.Diplomatically, given how well things are going, it would not be surprising if Saudi Arabia is classified next as a “state sponsor of terror” by the State Department for its allegiance with the Kremlin (sounds like the Iranians might suddenly have company).A withdrawal of arms deals could (or would most likely) follow.To that end, Panikoff says, the bigger question is whether European Union countries would try to jump in to fill the military hardware gap instead, just as Dassault Aviation - the French Rafale jet manufacturer - came to an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to sell its jets shortly after Abu Dhabi called off the deal to purchase the US-made F-35. “If so, it will undermine U.S. leverage to redefine the contours of its relationship with Saudi Arabia; if not, the United States will have to decide whether it’s going to try to compel Riyadh to re-engage with Washington in a strategic manner or accept a more transactional relationship,” Panikoff said.But back to the question of why the oil market is surprisingly desensitized to the incredibly tense U.S.-Saudi backdrop.Some say it’s because such a showdown is quite unprecedented - with none of the OPEC-related crises of the past 60 years coming this close to rewriting the rules of political and diplomatic engagement between two of the world’s most important allies.“Simply put, oil traders do not know how to react at this point as no one knows for sure how this is going to go,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “But one thing’s for sure: It’s not going away. So grab your popcorn, raise your recliner to your favorite position and release the pause button on your OPEC+ TV, for what is to come.”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Crude prices were down as much as 7% on the week, giving back about half of the past two weeks’ gains, after latest readings for U.S. retail sales and consumer price inflation showed the Fed was barely winning in its year-long battle against price pressures.“The global growth outlook remains a major downside risk, also,” Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said, pointing to new lockdowns in China, the world's largest crude oil importer, which has been fighting COVID flare-ups after a week-long holiday.“With labor markets remaining tight and inflation stubborn, further downgrades could be on the cards,” Erlam added.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate crude did a final print of $85.55 per barrel, after settling Friday’s official session down $3.50, or 3.9%, at $85.61. For the week, WTI was down just over 7%. U.S. crude benchmark rose 17% over two prior weeks, in a powerful start to October, after a 12.5% drop in September and 24% loss for the third quarter.London-traded Brent oil put in a final print of $91.64, after settling Friday’s session down $2.94, or 3.1%, at $91.63. Brent had risen 13% over two prior weeks. The global crude benchmark was down 11% in September and dropped 22% in the third-quarter.Oil: Price OutlookSo, where are U.S. crude prices headed, at least technically?According to Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com, the previous week's strong rebound in WTI could not keep pace in the latest week, stopping short of the weekly middle Bollinger Band of $96 as it faced selling pressure at $93.64.“If WTI has any plans to continue grinding higher above $96 , short term support $81 needs to be respected, failing which 100 week SMA $78 can be revisited,” Dixit said.“If selling extends below the daily middle Bollinger Band $84.75 , we can see a correction towards $82.60.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity The dollar is stealing every bit of safe-haven shine out there, leaving gold - the original precious metal - with very little luster.Gold’s benchmark futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, settled at $1,648.90 an ounce, down $28.10, or 1.7%, on the day, after a session low at $1,646.15. For the week, it lost just over $60, or 3.5%.The spot price of bullion, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, was at $1,645.24 by 14:00 ET (18:00 GMT), after a midday tumble to $1,640.71.Investing.com data showed the weekly drop in gold was the metal’s worst since a near 4% drop during the week of early August.Gold broke below key $1,650 support on Thursday before bulls in the space lucked out, as the dollar’s tumble on talk of peak-inflation in the U.S. helped the yellow metal recoup virtually all that it lost on the day.Gold’s selling, however, resumed Friday as the Dollar Index rose for a seventh time in eight days. The index, which pits the dollar against the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc, reached a session high of 113.30. Technical charts indicated a very likely 120 high for the Dollar Index, said analysts.Bond yields benchmarked to the 10-year Treasury note, meanwhile, rocketed to a 14-year high of 4.06%.The dollar and yields have been chief beneficiaries of the Fed’s campaign against inflation as the central bank hiked interest rates by 300 basis points this year and looks set to add another 125 before the year-Gold: Price Outlook Said SKCharting’s Dixit: “Seven months of consistent bearish streak means few love gold enough to buy it,In other words, there are more people selling gold than buying it. Another interpretation is that such a one-sided bearish trade mostly occurs in situations where markets are net long.”He said monthly action on spot gold indicates the metal may continue to extend declines towards $1,630-$1,615. “If this zone of support fails, then a further drop to $1,600-$1,585 could be expected. At a point of time, the much touted $1,560 (50% Fibonacci retracement of $1046 -$2073) can be tested.”Dixit said bearish sentiments were likely to continue haunting gold as long as it remained beneath the $1665-$1685 minor resistance zone, while a bigger rejection point of $1,730-1,735 remains a decisive challenge.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesTurkish mine blast death toll rises to 41 - ErdoganOAPEC Sec Gen says OPEC+ decision to cut oil production 'correct']"

The price of crude oil ran up to a multiyear high of $120 a barrel shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine and again in mid-June as demand peaked with the summer driving season. However, oil prices have steadily fallen in recent months as concerns grow about the prospects of a global recession, and the impact that anti-Covid-19 lockdowns in China will have on energy demand.The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the U.S. standard, is trading below $80 a barrel after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies announced that they plan to cut oil output by as much as 2 million barrels a day, and the European Union imposed a $60 per barrel price cap on imports of Russian oil. As of this writing, WTI crude oil is trading at $77 a barrel, down from more than $90 per barrel at the start of November. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, is hovering near $83 per barrel.Oil stocks, which also declined over the summer, are now trading sideways or trending lower along with oil prices. This presents a potential buying opportunity for investors who are looking to ride oil stocks higher as we head into the New Year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNonetheless, geopolitical tensions, continued easing of Chinese lockdowns, and/or an economic rebound could boost oil prices next year. Here are seven of the best oil stocks to buy for 2023.XOMExxonMobil$107DVNDevon Energy$58.85CVXChevron$172.92BPBP PLC$33.80MROMarathon Oil$25.77OXYOccidental Petroleum$61.50SUSuncor Energy$30.10The Best Oil Stocks to Buy for 2023: ExxonMobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has benefitted from elevated energy prices throughout 2022. On Oct. 28, the integrated oil and natural gas company reported a record profit for last year’s third-quarter, causing analysts and investors to cheer. The Texas-based company said it earned a record $18.7 billion in Q3, up 177% from the same period a year earlier. Its earnings per share of $4.45 blew past analysts’ average $3.79 forecast, according to Refinitiv data.Story continuesThe Q3 print was the latest in a string of record-breaking earnings for America’s largest oil company. The outperformance sent XOM stock up 67% in 2022 to $105 a share. If the company manages to keep its quarterly profits flowing, the upward momentum of its stock should continue as well.Another great attribute of XOM stock is that it is a Dividend Aristocrat. Specifically, ExxonMobil has increased its dividend payout to shareholders for 39 consecutive years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, and its yield stands at 3.3%.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comOklahoma City-based Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is a good pick right now because the company is not just a leading oil company, but it is also a major producer of natural gas and natural gas liquids, making it a diversified energy company.The U.S. struck a deal with the European Union earlier this year aimed at reducing the bloc’s reliance on natural gas from Russia. The U.S. committed to provide Europe with at least 15 billion cubic meters more of liquified natural gas by the end of 2022. The goal of the deal is to wean European countries such as Germany and France off natural gas that comes from Russia. Previously, about 40% of Europe’s energy supply came from Russia.DVN stock is up 28% in the past 12 months but currently sits 25% below its 52-week high of $79.40. Buy the dip before the share price recovers.The stock also pays a monster dividend that currently yields 8.8%, which is good for a quarterly payout of $1.29 per share.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comThere are a couple of reasons for investors to consider buying the shares of California-based Chevron (NYSE:CVX). First, the company recently reported a net profit for the third quarter of $11.2 billion, its second-highest quarterly profit ever.Second, while CVX stock is up 45% over the last year at $173, the shares still do not look overvalued with a price-earnings ratio of only 9.85 and a market capitalization of $335 billion. Lastly, the company pays a quarterly dividend of $1.42 a share for an attractive 3.2% yield.Chevron’s Q3 net profit of $11.2 billion equaled $5.78 per share, nearly double the $6.1 billion that it achieved in the same quarter of 2021, and ahead of the average EPS estimate of  Wall Street analysts of $4.86.The blockbuster earnings have led analysts across Wall Street to revise their forecasts and ratings on CVX stock throughout the year. Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), for example, maintains an “outperform” rating on the stock and a price target of $202.Chevron has also boosted its share buybacks this year, lifting them to $15 billion.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comHouston-based Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has gotten a lot of attention over the last year as the new favorite stock of famed value investor Warren Buffett. A relentless deal hunter, Buffett says he is always on the lookout for strong businesses and undervalued stocks, and, when he finds the right combination, he buys shares with a purpose.Buffett seems to like what he sees from OXY stock. The Oracle of Omaha has been buying shares of the U.S. oil company hand over fist since last spring. His total investment now stands at 188.4 million shares, or 20.2% of the company, worth $11.3 billion.Buffett no doubt likes that OXY stock nearly doubled in 2022, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500. He also certainly likes Occidental Petroleum’s low P/E ratio of 5.3.While the quarterly dividend yields a skimpy 0.83%, Buffett probably likes that Occidental reinvests its profits in its business in the same way that his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), does. (Buffett’s company does not pay a dividend to its shareholders).Also like Berkshire, Occidental Petroleum is using its profits to buy back its own stock, as it has announced a $3 billion share repurchase program.British Petroleum (BP)BP stock: the BP company logo on a buildingSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.comBritish Petroleum (NYSE:BP) is another oil producer whose stock is looking very attractive right now. Its shares are up 25% in the last year and trading at $34. The stock has a dividend yield of 4% and an ultra-low forward P/E ratio of 5.4.Based in London, England, BP is one of the energy “supermajors” with trailing annual revenue of more than $200 billion, 60,000 employees, and a market capitalization of $102 billion.BP hiked its quarterly dividend to 36 cents per share following its exceptional earnings.

To appease Elliott Management, which is run by hedge fund titan Paul Singer, Suncor announced in July that it would expand its board of directors and undertake a strategic review of its retail business, which includes 1,500 gas stations across Canada, with a view to selling the part of its business estimated to be worth about 11 billion CAD ($8.05 billion).In July, Suncor Energy fired then-CEO Mark Little, who was replaced on an interim basis by the Executive Vice President for Downstream Operations Kris Smith. Mark Little’s departure came after Elliott Management raised concerns about safety and operational problems at Suncor, noting that there have been 12 fatalities at the company’s oil sites since 2014.In terms of its stock, Suncor Energy’s share price is up 17% in the past 12 months and is currently trading at $30 per share.

In this tough environment, Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella contends cloud technology can help companies ""do more"" with fewer resources than they once had.“Overall, we definitely see constraints in the macro environment that are leading to customers, and everyone essentially, asking the question of ‘How do we drive productivity?’” Nadella said during an interview for Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit, which will air on Monday, Oct. 17 from 9 a.m. EST to 5 p.m. EST. “When we think about software and technology, this is, in some sense, showtime for enabling any company to do more with less.""Cloud computing, which gives companies remote access to hardware and services through the internet, has been on the rise for years. Microsoft controls 21% of the global cloud market, putting it behind only Amazon's (AMZN) 39% market share, but ahead of Google and its 7% market share.In 2019, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business generated $38.9 billion of the company’s $125.8 billion in total revenue — or about 30%. The global pandemic supercharged the need for companies to deploy cloud platforms so they could operate without interruption. As a result, in 2021, Microsoft’s cloud revenue made up $60.1 billion of the company’s $168.1 billion in total revenue — nearly 36%.Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella speaks to Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley.“Cloud Migrations were super critical during the pandemic, even for resilience,” Nadella said. “And now, if you’re not on the cost frontier of the cloud, then you’re falling behind on productivity. If you’re not on the efficiency frontier of cloud native applications, you’re falling behind on productivity. If you’re not able to use the hybrid work infrastructure to bring everybody to be able to participate collaboratively in the organization, you’re falling behind.”'Software is ultimately the biggest deflationary force businesses can use'As companies look for ways to cut back, Nadella says the cloud could help them save cash. That would also help Microsoft’s bottom line if they turn to Nadella's company for those services.Story continuesBy signing up for cloud versions of software like Office, companies can save on spending large sums on individual software licenses for each employee. And by using Microsoft’s infrastructure-as-a-service offerings, companies can eliminate the need for their own on-premise hardware.“All of the macroeconomic headwinds that all of us face — none of us are immune — the tailwind we at least as a company have is our ability to deliver these solutions. Software is ultimately the biggest deflationary force businesses can use,” he explained.Europe in particular stands to gain from the cloud, Nadella said. European countries are looking for ways to save on infrastructure as they contend with an energy crisis driven by the war in Ukraine.“If you move to the cloud, by definition, you have the most efficient use of the scarce energy resource,” he explained. “Second, let's take a manufacturing plant. If you create a digital twin of a manufacturing plant, one of the benefits is you can make it more power efficient, because you can do the simulation to do the power draw that's most efficient. In fact, you can reduce waste as well. So overall, things of that nature, I think are going to drive up productivity.”Microsoft isn’t immune to the economic forces hitting its clients, which include chemical company Dow Inc. and Twitter. Nadella says the company is using its own products to improve overall efficiency.“We are applying it ourselves inside. How can we be more efficient in whether it's in our people operations or in our R&amp;D, or whether it's in our finance or our supply chain?"" Nadella said. ""So I think you will see us…take our own solutions and deploy them as efficiently as possible to drive productivity and leveraging operating expense and capital efficiency, capital efficiencies.” Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanGoogle’s Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro: Top tier smartphones with tons of Google smartsMicrosoft debuts Surface Pro 9, Surface Laptop 5, and Surface Studio 2+Elon Musk agrees to go ahead with $44 billion Twitter dealGot a tip?

16,3fa323b8-a63e-3fae-b9ec-a8ee58b6a495,MSFT,2022-10-16,Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shareholders have earned a 25% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-nasdaq-msft-shareholders-earned-110036316.html,1665918036,STORY,['MSFT'],"[Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 11% in the last quarter. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. In fact, the share price is 190% higher today. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 25% decline over the last twelve months.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Microsoft There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Microsoft achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 24%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Microsoft's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Microsoft the TSR over the last 5 years was 209%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 24% received by Microsoft shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -25%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 25% per year over half a decade. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been pleasing. In the last three years the share price is up, 56%: better than the market.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.2%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. See our latest analysis for Monster Beverage While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Monster Beverage achieved compound earnings per share growth of 6.3% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Monster Beverage's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Monster Beverage's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Monster Beverage shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 2.1% over the last year. However, that falls short of the 9% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

While it’s not easy putting money into the markets when sentiment is so negative, there are still cheap stocks that Wall Street analysts love. Whether you have the nerve to make a move is another story altogether. There’s no shame in sitting on cash rather than throwing money down a potential rabbit hole.  For those who aren’t backing down from Mr. Market, though, I’m looking at stocks that have solid balance sheets, are making good money and have strong analyst support. You’ll notice that there are some familiar names on the list, as well as some lesser-known businesses. All seven of them have a shot at redemption in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBOOTBoot Barn $52.41GOOGLAlphabet$87.32MXLMaxLinear$31.51ALKAlaska Air Group$44.24LITELumentum$55.25EPAMEPAM Systems$307.29MSFTMicrosoft$224.51Cheap Stocks Wall Street Analysts Love: Boot Barn (BOOT)the boot barn logo outside of a boot barn storeSource: David Tonelson / Shutterstock.comShares of Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT), a specialty retailer of Western wear, have gotten crushed in 2022, down more than 57% year to date. However, over the past five years, the stock is up more than 336%. Of the 12 analysts covering BOOT stock, 11 rate it either a “buy” or “overweight,” with only one “hold.” So, we have a beaten-down stock that is popular with analysts but with a recession looming. In early January, I selected Boot Barn and six other stocks I thought could double for a second consecutive year. Of course, I had no idea about the terrible year the markets would experience in 2022. However, the company’s growth story remains intact. Boot Barn reported its latest quarterly results at the end of October. They were better than analyst expectations. On the top line, revenue of $351.5 million was up 12.4% year over year and beat the consensus estimate by $8.5 million. On the bottom line, earnings per share of $1.06 were down from a year ago but much better than the 90 cents per share analysts were predicting. Story continuesFor its full fiscal year ending April 1, 2023, Boot Barn expects to open 40 new stores, grow sales by at least 10.9% to $1.65 billion, and deliver earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90.Based on its guidance for 2023, BOOT trades at a cheap 1x sales and 9.1x earnings at the midpoint of its range. The average analyst price target of $89.27 is 70% above the current price.Alphabet (GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comFor those who are bearish on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), one of the biggest issues is Google’s ad revenue, which the bears fear will be severely dented by a recession. The counterargument is that companies are forced to double down on advertising during recessions to maintain their growth. And some feel a slowdown in ad revenue has already been factored into the share price, which is down 40% on the year.What Google loses in ad revenue, the company will more than make up in the cloud. In Q3, Alphabet generated $6.87 billion from its cloud business. That’s an annual run rate of $27.5 billion.Investors should also consider what it may mean for the stock if the ad slowdown doesn’t materialize. That’s a risk/reward proposition worth taking, especially given that Alphabet has generated $62.5 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. That’s a financially sound company you want to own should a recession rear its ugly head. Over the past five years, shares are up more than 69% versus 48% for the S&amp;P 500. Of the 48 analysts covering GOOGL stock, 44 rate it either a “buy” or “overweight,” with only four “holds.” The average target price is $126.67, which is 45% higher than where shares currently trade.Finally, its price-to-sales ratio of 4.17 is below its five-year average of 6.6. By every metric, GOOGL stock is cheaper than it’s been in years. Cheap Stocks Wall Street Analysts Love: MaxLinear (MXL)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockMaxLinear (NASDAQ:MXL) is a California-based company that provides systems-on-chip solutions to broadband, mobile, wireline infrastructure, data centers, industrial applications and more. Founded in 2003, it went public in 2010 at $14 a share, raising more than $90 million in its initial public offering. Its shares are up 125% since then, underperforming the broader market. However, over the same period, the company’s annual revenue has grown more than 2,000% from $51.4 million in 2009 to an estimated $1.1 billion in 2022. Over the same period, it’s gone from an operating profit of $4.6 million in 2009 to a trailing 12-month operating profit of $169.5 million. That might not seem like much, but it’s more than double its 2021 operating profit of $67.5 million. Management continues to execute its plan to deliver profitable growth for shareholders. Over the past three fiscal years, thanks to its organic growth and acquisitions, its serviceable available market has doubled to $8 billion.   Of the 12 analysts covering MXL stock, 11 rate it a “buy” or “overweight,” with only one “hold.” The average target price of $49 is more than 55% higher than the current share price. In 2023, the consensus estimate is for MaxLinear to earn $3.92 per share. Shares are trading at 8.1 times that estimate, which is very cheap for a company growing sales and operating earnings by high double digits.MXL stock is one of the cheap stocks analysts love and an excellent long-term buy.   Alaska Air Group (ALK)Alaska Airlines (ALK) aircraft is airborne as it departs Los Angeles International AirportSource: Philip Pilosian / Shutterstock.comAlaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) announced on Oct. 26 that it had ordered 52 Boeing 737 Max aircraft for delivery between 2024 and 2027. This will bring its 737 MAX fleet to 146. In addition, it has the option to buy 105 more by 2030. It is the company’s largest order in its 90-year history. In an interesting twist, the airline is expanding its subscription service to Salt Lake City from departure cities in California, Arizona and Nevada. Subscribers can book up to 24 roundtrip flights in a year at a fixed monthly rate. In October, the airline reported excellent third-quarter results, including a record $2.8 billion in operating revenue, which was 45% higher than a year earlier. Alaska Air’s load factor — defined as the number of seats it sells versus those available — of 86.9% was 620 basis points higher than a year earlier. Anytime an airline gets above 80%, it generally makes money on its flights. Third-quarter adjusted net income of $325 million was 74% better than a year ago. And Alaska Air ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet and adjusted net debt of just $805 million, which is just 14% of its market cap. Of the 13 analysts covering the stock, 12 rate it a “buy” or “overweight,” with only one “hold.” Their average target price of $61.58 is 39% higher than where shares currently trade. Cheap Stocks Wall Street Analysts Love: Lumentum (LITE)A corporate office for the technology company Lumentum during the daytime.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comI included Lumentum (NASDAQ:LITE) in a September article on tech stocks to buy with superior fundamentals. The maker of optical and photonics products had delivered excellent quarterly results only two weeks earlier, including net income of 49 cents a share, 28 cents better than the consensus analyst estimate, in the final quarter of the company’s fiscal 2022 year. However, shares sold off following the report, dropping nearly 7% on the day, as investors weren’t impressed with management’s Q1 2023 guidance. Fast-forward roughly three months and we’re seeing a similar scenario play out. This time, the stock plunged 16% in a single day following the release of the company’s Q1 fiscal 2023 results on Nov. 28, again on disappointing guidance. Year to date, the stock is down 48%.However, the company beat on the top and bottom lines. It generated revenue of $506.8 million, $5.4 million higher than the consensus estimate. On the bottom line, it earned $1.69 a share, excluding one-time items, 10 cents higher than analyst expectations. As for the guidance for the fiscal second quarter, management expects revenue of $505 million at the midpoint of its range, 13% higher than a year earlier, with a non-GAAP operating margin of 21%, significantly below the 31.7% operating margin a year earlier. Its non-GAAP EPS is also expected to be lower. Yet, analysts remain bullish on the stock. Of the 15 analysts covering LITE stock, 13 rate it a “buy” or “overweight,” with two “holds.” The average target price of $108.36 is 96% higher than where it currently trades. Analysts expect EPS of $5.97 a share for fiscal 2023, ending in July, and $6.73 in 2024. Based on these estimates, share are trading at 9.2x fiscal 2023 earnings and 8.2x fiscal 2024 earnings.The risk is high, given the company’s guidance, but the potential rewards are commensurate.EPAM Systems (EPAM)The logo for Epam Systems is seen on the side of an office building.Source: Tricky_Shark / Shutterstock.comEPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM) is a technology company providing engineering services for software development and digital platforms. Of the 17 analysts who cover it, 15 rate it a “buy” or “overweight,” with two “holds.” Their average target price of $426.67 is 39% above the current share price. I happened to see an article recently suggesting EPAM Systems has excellent capital allocation. To me, excellent capital allocation means generating significant free cash flow. In the trailing 12 months, its FCF was $445.9 million. That’s a decent amount for a company that’s expected to grow its revenue by 28% this year to $4.8 billion. It might not be the 41% YOY growth it delivered in 2021, but it would be more than $1 billion higher for all of 2022.For the third quarter, revenue rose 24% year over year to $1.2 billion, while non-GAAP net income of $183.7 million was 28% higher than in Q3 2021. Management said on the earnings conference call that Q3 revenue from its top 20 clients grew by 22% YOY. Perhaps more telling is the fact that revenue from customers outside the top 20 increased by 25% over Q3 2021.EPAM finished the third quarter with nearly $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. That compares to just $28.2 million in long-term debt. In other words, its balance sheet is rock solid. Cheap Stocks Wall Street Analysts Love: Microsoft (MSFT)MSFT stock: A Microsoft office buildingSource: gguy / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a very popular stock among analysts. Of the 53 that cover it, 48 rate it a “buy” or “overweight,” with four “holds” and one “sell.” The average target price of $291.97 is 30% higher than where it currently trades.This bullishness is not surprising given Microsoft’s many powerhouse businesses, including Microsoft Azure. CEO Satya Nadella has ridden the move to the cloud all the way to the bank — and shareholders are thankful for that. Right now, the elephant in the room is Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), pending regulatory approval. Even though Activision reported excellent Q3 earnings on Nov. 7, the video game company’s shareholders are more concerned about Microsoft getting the thumbs up. The difference between approval and rejection is currently around $23 — Microsoft is paying $95 a share for ATVI — but it could widen considerably should regulators say “no.” On Nov. 8, the European Commission said it would undertake a second and more thorough examination of the Microsoft-Activision merger that could last through March.While Xbox could benefit from the combination, Microsoft remains a force to be reckoned with — with or without the acquisition. If Microsoft’s trailing 12-month free cash flow of $63.3 billion were revenue, it would be a Fortune 100 company. That’s mighty. As for Microsoft Azure, it finished the latest quarter with $20.3 billion in revenue, $200 million less than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services. It’s a neck-and-neck race that will continue to play out in 2023 and beyond. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:GS) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Non-Executive Director, David Viniar, for US$7.0m worth of shares, at about US$411 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$300). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Specifically, Global Treasurer Philip Berlinski ditched US$2.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does Goldman Sachs Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$499m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Goldman Sachs Group Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Goldman Sachs Group and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course Goldman Sachs Group may not be the best stock to buy.

And the recent movement in copper prices is a perfect illustration of this risk. Nevertheless, this is a time when investors should be looking at copper stocks to buy.The thesis for copper is that it will be an essential metal in the production of electric vehicles, solar panels, and other elements of our cleaner, greener economy. And that’s not currently reflected in the price of many copper stocks. Instead, they’ve been treated as risk-on assets, which means their prices have dropped along with their valuations.However, according to a recent report by S&amp;P Global, demand for copper will nearly double from 25 million metric tons (MMt) in 2021 to 49 MMt in 2035. The firm cites the clean energy transition as a large reason for this growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvesting in long-term trends requires patience. The markets aren’t going to tell you when the reversal in copper prices will happen. But if you believe that the transition to clean energy is real, then you can believe that copper is in the early stages of a long growth cycle. With that in mind, here are seven copper stocks to buy to prepare for this reversal.SCCOSouthern Copper$48.07NEMNewmont$41.91FCXFreeport McMoRan$28.84BHPBHP Group$49.14TRQTurquoise Hill$29.19CPPMFCopper Mountain Mining$1.32COPXGlobal X Copper Miners ETF$28.39Southern Copper (SCCO)Piece of copper set against black backgroundSource: Coldmoon Photoproject/Shutterstock.comFirst on this list of copper stocks to buy is Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO). Southern Copper is the world’s largest copper mining company with over $89 million in copper reserves.One driver of this massive footprint is the company’s mining operations in Peru. The Peruvian market is actually very important to global production, as Peru holds approximately 13% of the world’s copper. Given the company’s extensive operations globally, Southern Copper has built a fine-tuned model which provides the lowest-cost production in the industry at approximately 80 cents per pound.Story continuesSouthern Copper trades at an appealing P/E ratio of 12.70 and pays a dividend that has a yield as of Oct. 11 of 6.27%, which works out to an annualized payout of $3 per share. In calling SCCO stock one of the top precious metals stocks to own, I concluded that the company’s dividend makes Southern Copper attractive because you’ll get paid to be patient, no matter how long it takes for commodities to rebound.Newmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont (NYSE:NEM) is one of the largest miners in the world. The mining giant is largely known for being a gold miner, In fact, Newmont has over 96 million ounces of gold reserves. But the company is also become one of the world’s leading copper miners.That’s significant because at this time, investors should be prioritizing quality when considering which stocks to hang onto for the long haul. And Newmont qualifies as such with a solid balance sheet that includes a total liquidity buffer of $7.3 billion.Given the steep decline in commodity prices, it’s not surprising that NEM stock is down sharply from its 52-week (and all-time) high set in April 2022. That said, this environment is now making the stock look like an attractive value bet. This valuation, combined with Newmont’s dividend yield of 5.2% and annualized payout of $2.20, makes NEM stock a top copper stock to buy right now.Freeport McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comFreeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX) makes this list of copper stocks to buy, as it is one of the leading copper miners in the world. That said, Freeport is another diverse mining operation. In addition to copper production, Freeport also engages in gold mining and is a major producer of the rare earth metal molybdenum which is a critical alloy for steel.This gives the company several potential revenue streams, and the company clearly believes that copper is one of them. In fact, the company cited the S&amp;P Global study mentioned in the introduction to this article in offering a bullish outlook for copper demand in the next 10 to 15 years.Like many miners, Freeport McMoRan is currently caught in a push-pull scenario. On the one hand, public policy and private sector initiatives point to strong demand. On the other hand, the macroeconomic picture includes several headwinds. To begin with, inflation remains at elevated levels. This in turn is forcing interest rates to move higher. Accordingly, these factors in aggregate appears to point to weakening consumer demand.That means that the short-term outlook for FCX stock is likely to remain muddled. The company’s mid- to long-term outlook, on the other hand, looks far more favorable.BHP Group (BHP)Stacks of copper tubingSource: ShutterstockNext on this list of copper stocks to buy is one of the top Australian stocks in the market. Australia is known for its vast supply of natural resources. And BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) mines many of those resources, including nickel and potash.Russia’s war with Ukraine makes the company’s access to potash a compelling reason to buy the stock. However, the focus of this article is copper. And the company plans to increase its capital expenditure to meet the global demand for copper. This makes BHP stock a compelling choice for investors looking to benefit from undervalued stocks that offer the benefit of international exposure.Additionally, the company’s fundamentals suggest that it’s an undervalued choice as well. The company’s P/E ratio of 5.7-times is low, even in a sector where P/E values tend to average below 10-times earnings. Thus, while I wouldn’t count on the company maintaining a dividend yield of 13.93%, BHP stock currently offers a $6.97 per share annualized payout that income-oriented investors should not dismiss.Turquoise Hill (TRQ)a cart filed with gold in a gold mineSource: ShutterstockInvestors could just as easily put Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), the parent company of Turquoise Hill (NYSE:TRQ), on this list. Indeed, the former has given Turquoise Hill $2.3 billion in funding to complete its underground gold-copper mine at Oyu Tolgoi in Southern Mongolia. But in the interest of giving investors some alternatives, Turquoise Hill Resources is a mid-cap company with its own merits.For starters, the company is projected to grow revenue and earnings at double-digit rates over the next five years. With many analysts are forecasting an earnings recession for many companies, this isn’t something to quickly dismiss. Investors may learn more about a potential earnings slowdown when the company reports earnings in early November.In the meantime, the stock trades at a P/E of just over 10-times earnings. That makes it slightly overvalued to the sector, and investors don’t get a dividend with TRQ stock. Still, if the company’s forecasts for revenue and earnings come to fruition, this stock will look like a deep value pick at its current price.Copper Mountain Mining (CPPMF)Copper ingots in a stack on a white background. Copper stocks.Source: ppart / ShutterstockThe last single stock on this list of copper stocks to buy is the Copper Mountain Mining (OTCMKTS:CPPMF). As you can see by the over-the-counter designation, this is a penny stock, but one that may be worth considering as part of a broader precious metals portfolio.CPPMF got a huge tailwind from the anticipated demand increase brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the stock fell in lock-step with the price of commodities starting in early April. In the last month, however, the stock is up 9%. And that gain is even larger when you consider that it was trading for 93 cents a share in late September.The reason for the renewed optimism is due to the conclusions of a technical report that forecasts a larger amount of reserves than previous estimates and a longer life for its flagship mine. This in turn allowed the company to raise its production estimates. The company now believes it will produce approximately 138 million pounds of copper equivalent on an annual basis beginning in 2023. That’s a 38% increase from the current annual production run rater of approximately 100 million pounds.Global X Copper Miners ETF (COPX)Blocks that spell out ETF in front of jar with money and change.Source: SHUN_J / ShutterstockExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a low-risk way for investors to get exposure to a particular sector. Accordingly, a great choice for gaining exposure to some of the best copper mining stocks (including many on this list) is through the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:COPX).This is the first ETF to give investors a pure-play option for investing in copper. The fund tracks a market-cap-weighted index that offers broad exposure to the entire industry. The methodology ranks companies by their average daily trading volume with respect to their corresponding exchanges over the past three months. If international exposure is important to you, it should be noted that the fund is heavily weighted to North American companies (about 40%), and is balanced semi-annually.The ETF currently has about $1.40 billion of assets under management and an expense ratio of 0.65%.Penny StocksOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.General Dynamics could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on General Dynamics will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like General Dynamics' to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 3.4% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen a 5.9% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 11% each year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.5% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.With this information, we find it interesting that General Dynamics is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On General Dynamics' P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Our examination of General Dynamics' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for General Dynamics   you should know about.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

31,faa3221e-14d4-3279-91fb-458dbefc3c28,NOV,2022-10-16,Energy & Precious Metals - Weekly Review and Outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-045444344.html,1665896084,STORY,"['GC=F', 'CL=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- Crude prices fell last week for a fifth week in seven over what analysts said were concerns that U.S. inflation was just not slowing as the Federal Reserve expected, to the extent that it was now affecting consumer sentiment and retail sales as well.That may well be the case but the oil market was clearly not talking about the elephant in the room - i.e. the biggest geopolitical crisis to hit the trade in years, one with ramifications as important to energy as the Russia-Ukraine crisis itself.We’re talking about the OPEC+ oil production cut - the size and, more importantly, timing of it - that has got the White House all miffed.As Jonathan Panikoff, senior member at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, puts it, the decision by the Saudi-steered and Russia-supported oil-producing alliance to reduce output is probably not aimed just at President Joe Biden or the United States.“But the manner in which it’s being implemented probably is - and it has the potential to be politically damaging for both the president and Democrats,” said Panikoff.“The timing of the cuts - to take effect November 1, one week ahead of the US midterm elections - and their intensity, removing up to two million barrels per day from the market, probably reflect a willingness by Saudi Arabia to jab at Biden. Riyadh is not naïve about the US political landscape. OPEC+ almost certainly could have achieved its same overall goal but waited to act until shortly after the US midterms.”That brings us to Panikoff’s analysis of the fundamental problem between the United States and Saudi Arabia: a relation that’s rife with misaligned expectations.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - a.k.a. MbS - continues to demonstrate his preference for global engagement that is transactional, similar to how both China and Russia generally engage in the world. The problem is, that’s not traditionally how Washington conducts foreign policy, preferring long-term strategic relationships.Story continuesMbS surely recognizes the broader global context of his decision-making. Riyadh’s support of the cuts reflects a conscious decision to actively support Moscow at a time when the world knows the United States is working to challenge Russia’s ability to successfully wage war in Ukraine, including by limiting capital available to Moscow from oil sales.Inevitably, Riyadh will claim the cuts are in the best interest of Saudi Arabia, and that may be true. In the short term, a coming global recession might portend greater supply and risk pushing oil prices down further. In the long term, as global energy transitions away from fossil fuels accelerate, Riyadh might think that it only has so many years left of high oil prices to glean the revenue needed to reform its economy.But even if that is Riyadh’s thinking, its behavior indicates a belief that it has nothing to lose on national security by aligning with Russia at this time. It’s true that if the United States makes a hasty and unwise decision to immediately withdraw its security umbrella from Saudi Arabia, Washington risks seeing Beijing fill that gap. On the other hand, Beijing has long been hesitant to play the role of security guarantor, and China cannot completely fill the hardware gap that would exist if the United States left—most prominently for missile defense, a field in which China is still developing its capabilities.Riyadh may sincerely believe that the economic issues associated with oil prices are distinct from the security requirements for which it relies on the United States. But for Washington, economic security is very much core to national security. To that end, MBS needs to be careful. There are limits to how much the Biden administration is going to accept from a country that’s supposed to be a critical ally - even a transactional one.Almost every U.S. president from the 70s to now - that’s Richard Nixon to Joe Biden - have had problems with the kingdom and its love child called OPEC (over the past six years, it’s been OPEC+ after the Saudis’ co-opting of Russia and nine other players into the wider group).Many U.S. commanders-in-chief had vented about the Saudis and the oil cartel, but ultimately did nothing about both.Donald Trump had mixed results though. Despite him and his son-in-law being as chummy as possible with the House of Saud, Trump often waged a gleeful ‘war’ of his own with the cartel through precision-guided drones (tweets) to get oil prices down. The post-Covid collapse of crude prices was, of course, a game changer for Trump, making him contrite enough to lend the combined forces of the Saudis and Russians a helping hand to put the oil market back together again.Enter Biden in January 2022, and nothing has been the same since for the Americans and the Saudis. In fact, almost every month has been progressively worse for diplomatic ties and the supply-demand situation in oil (the president’s “pariah-state” comment against Riyadh over the Jamal Khashoggi killing not helping).Biden’s maiden visit to the Saudi capital in July was unsurprisingly more disastrous, with the president telling MbS on his face, on Saudi soil, that he thought the crown prince was responsible for the killing. Hence, a 500,000 barrels-per-day production cut originally conceived as a “bridge-building” move by the Saudis in response to the visit ended up becoming an insulting 100,000-bpd at MbS’ order.Biden has to realize that he’s not only butting heads with the source of the world’s most critical oil supply. He’s also up against a crown prince and energy minister (the latter being MbS’ half brother, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, or AbS) whose combined egos are probably greater than the dignity of the rest of the Arab world.So, comes the question: What could the White House hope to achieve in a political reset with the Saudis?With the midterm elections just weeks away, it’s hard to think of anything the administration could do at this point - other than to release more oil from the U.S. reserve - to bring crude prices lower.On the contrary, prices could actually rise on the new turmoil that’s being created; though justice-seekers to Saudi extravagance would probably cheer. If MbS thinks it’s alright to give Biden a jab below the belt just before the elections, it’s probably not wrong either for the president to show the crown prince that he indeed has something below that belt to accuse him on his face of murder.Diplomatically, given how well things are going, it would not be surprising if Saudi Arabia is classified next as a “state sponsor of terror” by the State Department for its allegiance with the Kremlin (sounds like the Iranians might suddenly have company).A withdrawal of arms deals could (or would most likely) follow.To that end, Panikoff says, the bigger question is whether European Union countries would try to jump in to fill the military hardware gap instead, just as Dassault Aviation - the French Rafale jet manufacturer - came to an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to sell its jets shortly after Abu Dhabi called off the deal to purchase the US-made F-35. “If so, it will undermine U.S. leverage to redefine the contours of its relationship with Saudi Arabia; if not, the United States will have to decide whether it’s going to try to compel Riyadh to re-engage with Washington in a strategic manner or accept a more transactional relationship,” Panikoff said.But back to the question of why the oil market is surprisingly desensitized to the incredibly tense U.S.-Saudi backdrop.Some say it’s because such a showdown is quite unprecedented - with none of the OPEC-related crises of the past 60 years coming this close to rewriting the rules of political and diplomatic engagement between two of the world’s most important allies.“Simply put, oil traders do not know how to react at this point as no one knows for sure how this is going to go,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “But one thing’s for sure: It’s not going away. So grab your popcorn, raise your recliner to your favorite position and release the pause button on your OPEC+ TV, for what is to come.”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Crude prices were down as much as 7% on the week, giving back about half of the past two weeks’ gains, after latest readings for U.S. retail sales and consumer price inflation showed the Fed was barely winning in its year-long battle against price pressures.“The global growth outlook remains a major downside risk, also,” Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said, pointing to new lockdowns in China, the world's largest crude oil importer, which has been fighting COVID flare-ups after a week-long holiday.“With labor markets remaining tight and inflation stubborn, further downgrades could be on the cards,” Erlam added.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate crude did a final print of $85.55 per barrel, after settling Friday’s official session down $3.50, or 3.9%, at $85.61. For the week, WTI was down just over 7%. U.S. crude benchmark rose 17% over two prior weeks, in a powerful start to October, after a 12.5% drop in September and 24% loss for the third quarter.London-traded Brent oil put in a final print of $91.64, after settling Friday’s session down $2.94, or 3.1%, at $91.63. Brent had risen 13% over two prior weeks. The global crude benchmark was down 11% in September and dropped 22% in the third-quarter.Oil: Price OutlookSo, where are U.S. crude prices headed, at least technically?According to Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com, the previous week's strong rebound in WTI could not keep pace in the latest week, stopping short of the weekly middle Bollinger Band of $96 as it faced selling pressure at $93.64.“If WTI has any plans to continue grinding higher above $96 , short term support $81 needs to be respected, failing which 100 week SMA $78 can be revisited,” Dixit said.“If selling extends below the daily middle Bollinger Band $84.75 , we can see a correction towards $82.60.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity The dollar is stealing every bit of safe-haven shine out there, leaving gold - the original precious metal - with very little luster.Gold’s benchmark futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, settled at $1,648.90 an ounce, down $28.10, or 1.7%, on the day, after a session low at $1,646.15. For the week, it lost just over $60, or 3.5%.The spot price of bullion, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, was at $1,645.24 by 14:00 ET (18:00 GMT), after a midday tumble to $1,640.71.Investing.com data showed the weekly drop in gold was the metal’s worst since a near 4% drop during the week of early August.Gold broke below key $1,650 support on Thursday before bulls in the space lucked out, as the dollar’s tumble on talk of peak-inflation in the U.S. helped the yellow metal recoup virtually all that it lost on the day.Gold’s selling, however, resumed Friday as the Dollar Index rose for a seventh time in eight days. The index, which pits the dollar against the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc, reached a session high of 113.30. Technical charts indicated a very likely 120 high for the Dollar Index, said analysts.Bond yields benchmarked to the 10-year Treasury note, meanwhile, rocketed to a 14-year high of 4.06%.The dollar and yields have been chief beneficiaries of the Fed’s campaign against inflation as the central bank hiked interest rates by 300 basis points this year and looks set to add another 125 before the year-Gold: Price Outlook Said SKCharting’s Dixit: “Seven months of consistent bearish streak means few love gold enough to buy it,In other words, there are more people selling gold than buying it. Another interpretation is that such a one-sided bearish trade mostly occurs in situations where markets are net long.”He said monthly action on spot gold indicates the metal may continue to extend declines towards $1,630-$1,615. “If this zone of support fails, then a further drop to $1,600-$1,585 could be expected. At a point of time, the much touted $1,560 (50% Fibonacci retracement of $1046 -$2073) can be tested.”Dixit said bearish sentiments were likely to continue haunting gold as long as it remained beneath the $1665-$1685 minor resistance zone, while a bigger rejection point of $1,730-1,735 remains a decisive challenge.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesTurkish mine blast death toll rises to 41 - ErdoganOAPEC Sec Gen says OPEC+ decision to cut oil production 'correct']"

34,be2149fb-7cbe-3c5a-9be1-20a8dc66cb49,MRK,2022-10-16,Merck's (NYSE:MRK) five-year earnings growth trails the 12% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mercks-nyse-mrk-five-earnings-130039258.html,1665838839,STORY,['MRK'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the Merck share price has climbed 44% in five years, easily topping the market return of 33% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 22% , including dividends .Since the stock has added US$12b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. Check out our latest analysis for Merck While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Merck managed to grow its earnings per share at 29% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Merck has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Merck, it has a TSR of 77% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Merck shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 12% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Merck .If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

It was a very disappointing report, but I would offer it wasn't that surprising.

41,ceb07717-350a-3c9e-8b0c-df0a80af7c63,WFC,2022-10-16,Positive week for Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) institutional investors who lost 8.9% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-wells-fargo-company-130015751.html,1665838815,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[A look at the shareholders of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 8.9% losses, last week’s 3.3% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Wells Fargo. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Wells Fargo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Wells Fargo. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. With 7.0% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Wells Fargo &amp; Company insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$121m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Wells Fargo. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Wells Fargo better, we need to consider many other factors.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) Potentially Undervalued?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-110102689.html,1665918062.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Let's talk about the popular Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$242 and falling to the lows of US$183. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Intuitive Surgical's current trading price of US$183 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Intuitive Surgical’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical What Is Intuitive Surgical Worth?Great news for investors – Intuitive Surgical is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $251.98, but it is currently trading at US$183 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Intuitive Surgical’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Intuitive Surgical?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Intuitive Surgical's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 58%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ISRG is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ISRG for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ISRG. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

The increased computing power and data handling capabilities of mechatronic devices are allowing them new actions that previously weren’t possible for humans. Robotics is disrupting several industries healthcare, logistics, and automotive, creating opportunities like never before. Hence, robotics stocks have before more pertinent for investors than ever before.A report suggests that The global robotics market is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 22.8% over the next ten years. It will reach $214 billion in 2030 as demand increases for industrial robots and companies improve their technology.The changing preferences of consumers are leading to innovation in the robotics industry. For example, artificial intelligence has significantly improved human-robot interactions with chip advances that allow them to work more efficiently together. The heavy-duty use of robotics is on the rise, increasing demand for these machines. With that being said, let’s look at seven of the top needle-movers in the robotics sphere that are worth investing in at current prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPATHUiPath$11.78IRTCiRhythm Technologies$119.69FANUYFanuc$13.74NVDANvidia$115.86ISRGIntuitive Surgical$185.90TERTeradyne$74.02IPGPIPG Photonics$84.78UiPath (PATH)The UiPath logo on a smartphone in front of a computer screen.Source: dennizn/Shutterstock.comUiPath (NYSE:PATH) provides robotic process automatic (or RPA) services that can be effectively linked to a firm’s software infrastructure to perform tedious tasks such as invoice processing, customer onboarding, and entering heaps of data. It’s the leader in this niche market, which is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (or CAGR) of a whopping 38.2% from 2022 to 2030.Company growth rates have slowed due to the current macroeconomic climate. However, top-line growth is likely to improve substantially in a more conducive environment, while the firm’s gross margins remain in the mid-to-high 80s. Its strong margins give it plenty of pricing power. Moreover, it has $1.72 billion in cash, so it can continue to expand and invest in its business to generate multibagger gains by the end of the decade.Story continuesiRyhthm Technologies (IRTC)Image of a virtual heart in front of a diagramSource: ESB Professional/Shutterstock.comiRyhthm Technologies (NASDAQ:IRTC) operates a medical device business known for its popular Zio heart rate monitor. It’s an advanced heart monitoring system that makes remote monitoring and data collection much easier than existing technologies. The firm claims that its device allows healthcare professionals to use big data to improve healthcare outcomes for heart patients.The past couple of quarters has been encouraging for the business after a slump in last year’s fourth quarter. It can continue to grow its top line by double-digit margins in the future if it can effectively integrate telehealth and cloud health-into cardiovascular. Moreover, it plans to release other products, such as the Zio Watch, and improve its existing products and services to increase its market share. Its stock is currently down over 40% from its peak of $250, which provides an incredible entry point for long-term investors. Therefore, I believe it is one of the best robotic stocks to buy.Fanuc (FANUY)a worker with a tablet remotely operates a standalone robot armSource: ShutterstockFanuc (OTCMKTS:FANUY) is a Japanese industrial robotics giant with manufacturing facilities spread out across the U.S., China, and Japan. Its products are used for multiple purposes, and it boasts a diversified revenue base generating close to 50% of its revenues from its home country and China. Both markets are two of the leading players in the massive industrial robotics space. The operating income from China’s robotics sector is estimated to grow at an average of 20% from 2021 to 2025.Fanuc has been consistently profitable and has grown its top line by a healthy 8% average over the past five years. Moreover, its EBITDA growth averaged a remarkable 11% over the same period. With the massive growth expected in its core markets over the next several years, FANUY is positioned to capitalize on the boom. On top of that, it offers a strong dividend yield of over 2.5%.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) isn’t a robotics pure-play but, judging from recent development, could play a huge role in its revenue expansion in the future. Robotics has been of critical importance to the company’s Jetson chip line. Jetson is fitted with AI and machine learning software which offers multiple use cases in industries such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and others.Moreover, the chip giant recently revealed in its GPY Technology conference that multiple start-ups are using its cutting-edge new AI platform, Orin IGX. The platform is being used by more than 70 medical device specialists looking to accelerate the development of robotic surgery systems. Given its strong progress of late, NVDA could potentially give Intuitive Surgical and other top players in the robotics-assisted surgery market a run for their money. Thus, making it one of the top robotic stocks to buy.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comFeaturing as one of the top robotic stocks to buy, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) has established itself as the robotic surgical instruments market leader. Its tools allow doctors to perform minimally invasive surgeries, leading to better outcomes. ISRG has been a robust performer in the space, generating over 16% top-line growth in the past five years. Despite the impressive performance, in 2021, only 3% of surgeries were conducted robotically.Its competitive advantage comes from its massive patent base, which totaled 4,200 at the conclusion of last year. Moreover, its Da Vinci surgical systems come with substantial switching expenses. Training medical personnel to operate the machinery takes time, and healthcare facilities are unlikely to let the investment go to waste by opting for another platform. At the end of the second quarter, the Da Vinci systems had an installed base of 7,135, representing a 13% bump from the prior-year period. The majority of these customers should stay put.Teradyne (TER)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background.

Moreover, it layers its hardware stack with a robust software stack, enabling customers to maximize production capacity. As the robotics sector grows, the need for TER’s testing equipment and services will also grow rapidly.Operating results last year were mighty impressive, with the company posting double-digit gains across its top and bottom lines. It’s in a strong position to continue pushing forward, especially with its industrial automation wing, which it expects to grow at an amazing 40% annually through 2024. Hence, the demand for its products will remain strong over the long haul despite the temporary slump it currently finds itself in.IPG Photonics (IPGP)connection line on networking telecommunication concept background.

It develops medium, high, pulsed, and green-pulsed layers. Green-pulsed lasers, in particular, play a key role in producing batteries and electric vehicles. Hence, it operates in a massive market, and its continued investments will ensure it maintains its dominant positioning in the premium, high-margin laser space.It has grown its top and bottom line by single-digit margins and has the potential to perform even better once it gets past the current market headwinds. Moreover, it is looking to reduce its exposure to China, which is its top growth driver. It is seeking to reduce its reliance and has seen progress in the space.

The CHIPS and Science Act, passed by Congress and signed into law this year, is designed to increase semiconductor research and production in the U.S. Already, companies are making plans to expand their manufacturing bases in the U.S.Where does that leave us? It’s time to go bargain shopping for semiconductor stocks to buy and hold.The Portfolio Grader can be a great tool to help us find the best semiconductor stocks to buy now.

FSLR stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWhen you think about First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), you probably think first about solar power and not semiconductors. That’s perfectly reasonable. FSLR is one of the most well-known solar stocks out there.It’s also one of the best-performing stocks of the year. So far in 2022, FSLR stock is up by more than 70%, with plenty of reasons to think the trend will continue.Story continuesThe company announced that it will invest up to $1.2 billion to scale production of photovoltaic (PV) solar modules, which could allow it to increase its power capabilities by more than 10 gigawatts by 2025.The company says each of those modules features a layer of Cadmium Telluride semiconductor that’s thinner than a human hair. And it’s researching more ways to make products with an even thinner semiconductor layer.The potential here is clear, particularly with the emergency of the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. that restores a tax credit for U.S. manufacturers that start production of PV projects before 2025. FSLR stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Pineapple Energy (PEGY)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockThis is one of the smallest and least-known stocks on this list. But never fear – even though Pineapple Energy (NASDAQ:PEGY) is a true penny stock at fewer than $3 per share, and even though it has a market capitalization of barely $20 million, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about this energy company.While Pineapple’s core market is in Hawaii, the company actually has Minnesota roots. Communications Systems, which previously traded on the Nasdaq exchange as JCS, bought out Pineapple earlier this year and changed its name and ticker accordingly.Just prior to the merger, Pineapple had already bought two Hawaii solar companies, Hawaii Energy Connection and E-Gear. That gives the new Pineapple Energy a solid position in the Hawaii market.Pineapple aims to use that as a launching point for building a nationwide footprint in offering solar solutions.The company’s Q2 earnings report (its first since the merger) shows promise. Revenue was $5.9 million after being zero a year ago, and earnings per share was 15 cents – a welcome profit after the company lost 74 cents per share a year ago.PEGY stock was trading at less than $1 per share at the beginning of the month but is up more than 215% since then. PEGY has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.ON Semiconductor (ON)In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.Source: ShutterstockON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is a much less volatile play than PEGY, but it also has more of a track record to go by. It did get a big boost this summer when it joined the all-important S&amp;P 500 index.While much of the market is still deep in the red, ON Semiconductor is nearly breaking even, down less than 2% so far on the year. In a year like this, having a stock that’s flat is definitely better than one that’s been handing out losses right and left.The company makes semiconductors that are used in automotive, communications, computing, consumer, industrial, lighting, medical and military applications. That’s a great place to be in as companies are clamoring for semiconductors and the CHIPS Act makes buying semiconductors from U.S. companies easier.Earnings in the third quarter continued the company’s winning ways – revenue of $2.19 billion beat analysts’ expectations for $2.12 billion. EPS of $1.45 per share was better than the $1.31 the Street expected.ON has an “A”  rating in the Portfolio Grader.Amkor Technology (AMKR)silicon wafer in die attach machine in semiconductor manufacturingSource: ShutterstockAmkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) packages and tests integrated circuits for chip manufacturers. The company has a pretty big footprint outside of it’s home base in Arizona, with factories also in China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Portugal and Taiwan.Although it has faced some challenges this year – the company’s operations in Shanghai were hurt by China’s extended Covid-19 shutdown – but the stock has rallied as of late, up nearly 30% since early July.Third-quarter earnings of $2.08 billion and EPS of $1.25 per share easily beat analysts’ expectations and showed strong year-over-year growth (revenue was up 24% from a year ago, with net income of $306.1 million being  an increase of 69%).AMKR stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comI’m a big fan of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock because of its position in the 5G space.Broadcom designs and develops semiconductors for the wireless and broadband communication industry.That’s a great opportunity for investors because I’ve long been convinced that the applications of 5G could be life-changing. The ability to get lightning-quick internet speeds even when on Wi-Fi opens the doors for smart cities, machine learning, AI, virtual reality, and more.Broadcom is also buying enterprise software company VMWare (NYSE:VMW) in a $61 billion deal that will allow it to expand into cloud computing.Q3 revenue of $8.46 billion and earnings of $9.73 per share beat analysts’ expectations for $8.41 billion and $9.56 EPS.AVGO stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Enphase Energy (ENPH)mobile phone screen with enphase energy logo on it to represent renewable energy stocksSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAnother solar energy stock, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) makes and markets solar energy inverters and battery storage products. The company’s products allow customers to gather solar power, store it on a battery and use it in the event of a power grid failure.Enphase will be able to use a smartphone app to direct power to essential appliances, which will help them to maximize their power reserves.Earnings in the third quarter topped analysts’ estimates for the top and bottom lines as Enphase stock kept its hot streak intact. ENPH is up 55% so far on the year, including an 11% gain over the last month.ENPH stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Inpinj (PI)a close up image of a semiconductorSource: ShutterstockBased in Seattle, Inpinj (NASDAQ:PI) is a pretty cool company.

Its tags are also a critical tool for the Internet of Things, as it allows computers to track inventory and the supply chain.PI stock has had a pretty good year as well, up 16% in 2022, and up 22% just in the last month. Third-quarter earnings also continued the company’s trend of beating expectations, as it reported $68.27 million in revenue of 34 cents EPS – both better than the forecasted $64.79 million revenue and 20 cents EPS.PI stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader as well.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

However, supply chain disruption might have had some impact on overall the bottom-line performance.Let's see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Aeronautics to Post Impressive SalesThe Aeronautics segment, which primarily manufactures advanced, combat-proven jets and comprises almost 40% of the company’s top line, is expected to have delivered impressive performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteStrength in the classified business area as well as higher F-35 deliveries are expected to have boosted the performance of the Aeronautics segment in the quarter.

FHN.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Large-Cap Stocks Likely to Beat on Q3 EarningsU.S. stock markets are set for the third-quarter 2022 earnings season commencing this week.  Market participants will keenly watch this earnings season as it will provide the most descriptive view of U.S. corporate health amid record-high inflation and an extremely hawkish Fed.In addition to revenues and the net profit numbers of companies, several metrics of margins, like gross margin, operating margin and net margin will be of immense importance to investors this earnings cycle. Moreover, the outlook of U.S. corporations will guide the next course of Wall Street’s movement.Our estimates for third-quarter earnings of the market’s benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, have shown a gradual decline in the past three and a half months. As of Oct 12, per our estimation for the third quarter as a whole, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index will rise a mere 0.1% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues.We have identified five large-cap stocks that are set to beat on third-quarter earnings. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful as an earnings beat is expected to drive stock prices going forward. These companies are — Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and First Horizon Corp.Q3 at a GlanceLike the first half, the third quarter of 2022 also remained tough for the U.S. economy. Various measures of inflation remained elevated at a 40-year high. The Fed has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 3% so far in 2022 and it was in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% at the end of the third quarter. Moreover, the central bank has started to reduce the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet systematically since June.Story continuesDespite these aggressive monetary policies adopted by the Fed, inflation is showing no signs of declining. The complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and the shortage of labor continued to put pressure on businesses in the form of higher input costs and wages.The lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and the lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections were the major hindrances to the restoration of the global supply-chain system. Agencies like the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD have warned of a possible global recession in 2023.Stocks in FocusFive large-cap companies will report third-quarter 2022 earnings within the next seven days.

The price of crude oil ran up to a multiyear high of $120 a barrel shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine and again in mid-June as demand peaked with the summer driving season. However, oil prices have steadily fallen in recent months as concerns grow about the prospects of a global recession, and the impact that anti-Covid-19 lockdowns in China will have on energy demand.The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the U.S. standard, is trading below $80 a barrel after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies announced that they plan to cut oil output by as much as 2 million barrels a day, and the European Union imposed a $60 per barrel price cap on imports of Russian oil. As of this writing, WTI crude oil is trading at $77 a barrel, down from more than $90 per barrel at the start of November. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, is hovering near $83 per barrel.Oil stocks, which also declined over the summer, are now trading sideways or trending lower along with oil prices. This presents a potential buying opportunity for investors who are looking to ride oil stocks higher as we head into the New Year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNonetheless, geopolitical tensions, continued easing of Chinese lockdowns, and/or an economic rebound could boost oil prices next year. Here are seven of the best oil stocks to buy for 2023.XOMExxonMobil$107DVNDevon Energy$58.85CVXChevron$172.92BPBP PLC$33.80MROMarathon Oil$25.77OXYOccidental Petroleum$61.50SUSuncor Energy$30.10The Best Oil Stocks to Buy for 2023: ExxonMobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has benefitted from elevated energy prices throughout 2022. On Oct. 28, the integrated oil and natural gas company reported a record profit for last year’s third-quarter, causing analysts and investors to cheer. The Texas-based company said it earned a record $18.7 billion in Q3, up 177% from the same period a year earlier. Its earnings per share of $4.45 blew past analysts’ average $3.79 forecast, according to Refinitiv data.Story continuesThe Q3 print was the latest in a string of record-breaking earnings for America’s largest oil company. The outperformance sent XOM stock up 67% in 2022 to $105 a share. If the company manages to keep its quarterly profits flowing, the upward momentum of its stock should continue as well.Another great attribute of XOM stock is that it is a Dividend Aristocrat. Specifically, ExxonMobil has increased its dividend payout to shareholders for 39 consecutive years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, and its yield stands at 3.3%.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comOklahoma City-based Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is a good pick right now because the company is not just a leading oil company, but it is also a major producer of natural gas and natural gas liquids, making it a diversified energy company.The U.S. struck a deal with the European Union earlier this year aimed at reducing the bloc’s reliance on natural gas from Russia. The U.S. committed to provide Europe with at least 15 billion cubic meters more of liquified natural gas by the end of 2022. The goal of the deal is to wean European countries such as Germany and France off natural gas that comes from Russia. Previously, about 40% of Europe’s energy supply came from Russia.DVN stock is up 28% in the past 12 months but currently sits 25% below its 52-week high of $79.40. Buy the dip before the share price recovers.The stock also pays a monster dividend that currently yields 8.8%, which is good for a quarterly payout of $1.29 per share.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comThere are a couple of reasons for investors to consider buying the shares of California-based Chevron (NYSE:CVX). First, the company recently reported a net profit for the third quarter of $11.2 billion, its second-highest quarterly profit ever.Second, while CVX stock is up 45% over the last year at $173, the shares still do not look overvalued with a price-earnings ratio of only 9.85 and a market capitalization of $335 billion. Lastly, the company pays a quarterly dividend of $1.42 a share for an attractive 3.2% yield.Chevron’s Q3 net profit of $11.2 billion equaled $5.78 per share, nearly double the $6.1 billion that it achieved in the same quarter of 2021, and ahead of the average EPS estimate of  Wall Street analysts of $4.86.The blockbuster earnings have led analysts across Wall Street to revise their forecasts and ratings on CVX stock throughout the year. Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), for example, maintains an “outperform” rating on the stock and a price target of $202.Chevron has also boosted its share buybacks this year, lifting them to $15 billion.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comHouston-based Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has gotten a lot of attention over the last year as the new favorite stock of famed value investor Warren Buffett. A relentless deal hunter, Buffett says he is always on the lookout for strong businesses and undervalued stocks, and, when he finds the right combination, he buys shares with a purpose.Buffett seems to like what he sees from OXY stock. The Oracle of Omaha has been buying shares of the U.S. oil company hand over fist since last spring. His total investment now stands at 188.4 million shares, or 20.2% of the company, worth $11.3 billion.Buffett no doubt likes that OXY stock nearly doubled in 2022, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500. He also certainly likes Occidental Petroleum’s low P/E ratio of 5.3.While the quarterly dividend yields a skimpy 0.83%, Buffett probably likes that Occidental reinvests its profits in its business in the same way that his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), does. (Buffett’s company does not pay a dividend to its shareholders).Also like Berkshire, Occidental Petroleum is using its profits to buy back its own stock, as it has announced a $3 billion share repurchase program.British Petroleum (BP)BP stock: the BP company logo on a buildingSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.comBritish Petroleum (NYSE:BP) is another oil producer whose stock is looking very attractive right now. Its shares are up 25% in the last year and trading at $34. The stock has a dividend yield of 4% and an ultra-low forward P/E ratio of 5.4.Based in London, England, BP is one of the energy “supermajors” with trailing annual revenue of more than $200 billion, 60,000 employees, and a market capitalization of $102 billion.BP hiked its quarterly dividend to 36 cents per share following its exceptional earnings. The company announced that its Q3 net profit this year more than doubled from a year earlier to $8.2 billion.In addition to hiking its dividend, BP has been buying back stock with a vengeance, recently announcing that it is boosting its share buybacks by $2.5 billion to further reward shareholders.Suncor Energy (SU)A sign for a Suncor Energy (SU) building.Source: Brett Holmes / Shutterstock.comCanadian company Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) has attracted activist investor Elliott Management, which took a stake in the oil producer in 2022 and promptly called for changes at the company. To appease Elliott Management, which is run by hedge fund titan Paul Singer, Suncor announced in July that it would expand its board of directors and undertake a strategic review of its retail business, which includes 1,500 gas stations across Canada, with a view to selling the part of its business estimated to be worth about 11 billion CAD ($8.05 billion).In July, Suncor Energy fired then-CEO Mark Little, who was replaced on an interim basis by the Executive Vice President for Downstream Operations Kris Smith. Mark Little’s departure came after Elliott Management raised concerns about safety and operational problems at Suncor, noting that there have been 12 fatalities at the company’s oil sites since 2014.In terms of its stock, Suncor Energy’s share price is up 17% in the past 12 months and is currently trading at $30 per share. It has a thrifty P/E ratio of 7.5 and a solid dividend that yields 4.8% or 38 cents a share per quarter.Marathon Oil (MRO)marathon oil (MRO stock) logo on a screenSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comA truly diversified energy company that deals in natural gas as well as oil products, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is a direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company. Houston-based Marathon Oil is one of America’s preeminent energy companies.Its share price has risen 50% to $25 in the last year as the price of crude oil has climbed. In addition to the share price appreciation, other reasons to like MRO stock include its 1.42% dividend yield, $3 billion stock buyback program, and its low P/E ratio of 4.88. Plus, Wall Street analysts, on average, forecast that the company’s earnings more than tripled in 2022.Marathon Oil’s latest earnings certainly didn’t disappoint. The company announced Q3 net income of $832 million, or $1.24 per share, up 168% from $310 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts’ average forecast called for earnings of $1.19 per share, according to Refinitiv data.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

73,62afe418-f60c-319f-bc9a-917e8155aad6,ORCL,2022-10-16,"With 43% ownership, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) insiders have a lot at stake",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/43-ownership-oracle-corporation-nyse-110021272.html,1665918021,STORY,['ORCL'],"[If you want to know who really controls Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 43% to be precise, is individual insiders. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).So, insiders of Oracle have a lot at stake and every decision they make on the company’s future is important to them from a financial point of view.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Oracle, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Oracle ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Oracle?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Oracle. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Oracle's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Oracle. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Lawrence Ellison (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 42% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 3 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 52% stake.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of OracleWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Oracle Corporation. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$74b stake in this US$173b business. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Oracle. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Oracle better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Oracle   (of which 2 don't sit too well with us!) you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Stryker’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Stryker Is Stryker Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Stryker is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $269.49, but it is currently trading at US$209 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Stryker’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Stryker generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Stryker's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 75%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since SYK is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SYK for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock.

This cutting-edge system features a brand-new category of digital BGO (dBGO) detector material with a small crystal size that delivers more than two times the sensitivity of prior digital scannersii, enabling faster total scan timesiii and impressive small lesion detectabilityiv. It is designed to improve operational efficiency, enhance the patient experience, and increase diagnostic power, ideally helping to enable improved patient outcomes.Additionally, the system’s theranosticsv capabilities and ability to image short life tracers, as well as dynamic protocolsvi, help empower clinicians with greater clinical information across more oncology, cardiology, and neurology procedure types than ever before.""Sensitivity and image quality are everything in PET/CT,"" explains John Kennedy, Ph.D., Chief Physicist, Nuclear Medicine Department, Rambam Health Care Campus, and Lecturer at Technion – Israel Institute of Technologyvii. ""Omni Legend delivers on both – meeting all our image quality criteria for oncology and providing impressive sensitivity to image high count tracers for cardiac and neuro imaging, which helps better inform patient diagnoses and monitoring. Also, we have been able to increase patient throughput by more than a third thanks to the system’s fast total scan times – even achieving 35 patient scans in a 9.5-hour shift – and reduce dose by 40% versus the previous equipment that was installed. This not only enables better patient access and experience but also allows us to increase overall hospital efficiencyviii.""Story continuesAs the pace of change in healthcare continues to increase, health plan leaders cite managing costs and driving operational efficiency as the top two challenges they face todayix. This is consistent with comments by global Molecular Imaging departments, which note operational efficiency as a top barrier to growing PET/CT procedure volumesx.Omni Legend is GE Healthcare’s response to these growing challenges, helping healthcare systems overcome today’s barriers with a collection of intuitive workflow solutions enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI), including its new Precision DLi solution for deep learning image processing in PET/CT as well as its AI-based Auto Positioning Camera.""Having access to high-quality images to determine patient care is foundational to administering quality healthcare,"" adds Prof. Zohar Keidar, Director of Nuclear Medicine &amp; the PET/CT Department at Rambam and an Associate Clinical Professor at the Technion Faculty of Medicinevii. ""With this in mind, a department like ours – which has a very heavy workload – requires a system that enables flexibility for emergency cases, in addition to our already packed schedules. Omni Legend provides that flexibility. Within a few short weeks/months, we were able to increase our number of scans by 150 percent – going from 30 to 45 patient scans per day. We used to have a long wait list; but today, if something is urgent, we can quickly scan a patient while keeping our other scheduled appointmentsviii. And the system’s clinical protocols afford us additional flexibility, allowing us to stage patients on any scanner, regardless of the system the patients was previously scanned on – affording us new opportunities in fleet management.""More than a new processing technique, Precision DLi is engineered using Deep Learning with a sophisticated deep neural network trained on thousands of images created with different reconstruction methods. It was designed to provide the image quality performance benefits most associated with hardware-based Time-of-Flight, such as better contrast-to-noise ratio, contrast recovery, and quantitative accuracy.The capabilities of Omni Legend are further elevated by the inclusion of Q.Clear (BSREM), GE Healthcare’s pioneering PET image reconstruction technology, and MotionFree, the company’s proven, deviceless respiratory motion correction technology. Q.Clear helps to ensure reliable quantification, while MotionFree operates seamlessly in the background to correct respiratory motion artifacts for all patient types.Furthermore, the new system’s operational efficiency solutions help improve the PET/CT imaging experience for both the technologist and the patient with convenient features that provide:A fast data quality assurance process that saves time with streamlined calibration;Simplified protocol selection on the gantry touchscreen and a new user interface to enable an easy PET/CT process from start to finish; andEnhanced patient positioning capabilities as a result of AI-based Auto Positioning that automatically centers the patient for a completely hands-free positioning experience.This streamlined patient setup frees up technologists to focus on making patients feel more comfortable. Omni Legend also features LED ambient lighting to encourage a calming mood as well as a graphic pattern for the patient to view in the system to help in both alleviating stress and reducing movement for nervous patients.""We built our scalable Omni platform from the ground up to meet the needs of our customers and their patients today and in the future,"" shares Jean-Luc Procaccini, President &amp; CEO, Molecular Imaging &amp; Computed Tomography, GE Healthcare. ""With the patient in mind, we leaned on our longstanding technological leadership and strong clinical collaborations to enhance the scan experience with entirely new components designed to help improve clinical outcomes. The result is an all-digital detector, a cutting-edge deep learning solution, and workflow enhancements to help enable more personalized care.""Omni Legend was designed with theranostics in mind, enabling clinicians to reach new levels of sensitivity and detectability for incredibly clear images.

85,666495b9-8208-320c-bd0c-8e08fef42741,PG,2022-10-16,The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Will Pay A US$0.91 Dividend In Four Days,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-company-nyse-pg-123009300.html,1665837009,STORY,['PG'],"[Readers hoping to buy The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Procter &amp; Gamble's shares on or after the 20th of October will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.91 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.65 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Procter &amp; Gamble has a trailing yield of 2.9% on the current stock price of $125.08. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Procter &amp; Gamble has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Procter &amp; Gamble paid out more than half (59%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 65% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Procter &amp; Gamble earnings per share are up 9.8% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Procter &amp; Gamble has lifted its dividend by approximately 5.7% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Procter &amp; Gamble for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Procter &amp; Gamble from a dividend perspective.If you're not too concerned about Procter &amp; Gamble's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

88,a1810362-a3c0-3a7d-897e-0336508abffe,FCX,2022-10-16,7 Copper Stocks to Buy Now Before Prices Boom,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-copper-stocks-buy-now-222027735.html,1665613227,STORY,"['SCCO', 'NEM', 'FCX', 'BHP', 'TRQ']","[Investing in commodities always carries outsized risk. And the recent movement in copper prices is a perfect illustration of this risk. Nevertheless, this is a time when investors should be looking at copper stocks to buy.The thesis for copper is that it will be an essential metal in the production of electric vehicles, solar panels, and other elements of our cleaner, greener economy. And that’s not currently reflected in the price of many copper stocks. Instead, they’ve been treated as risk-on assets, which means their prices have dropped along with their valuations.However, according to a recent report by S&amp;P Global, demand for copper will nearly double from 25 million metric tons (MMt) in 2021 to 49 MMt in 2035. The firm cites the clean energy transition as a large reason for this growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvesting in long-term trends requires patience. The markets aren’t going to tell you when the reversal in copper prices will happen. But if you believe that the transition to clean energy is real, then you can believe that copper is in the early stages of a long growth cycle. With that in mind, here are seven copper stocks to buy to prepare for this reversal.SCCOSouthern Copper$48.07NEMNewmont$41.91FCXFreeport McMoRan$28.84BHPBHP Group$49.14TRQTurquoise Hill$29.19CPPMFCopper Mountain Mining$1.32COPXGlobal X Copper Miners ETF$28.39Southern Copper (SCCO)Piece of copper set against black backgroundSource: Coldmoon Photoproject/Shutterstock.comFirst on this list of copper stocks to buy is Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO). Southern Copper is the world’s largest copper mining company with over $89 million in copper reserves.One driver of this massive footprint is the company’s mining operations in Peru. The Peruvian market is actually very important to global production, as Peru holds approximately 13% of the world’s copper. Given the company’s extensive operations globally, Southern Copper has built a fine-tuned model which provides the lowest-cost production in the industry at approximately 80 cents per pound.Story continuesSouthern Copper trades at an appealing P/E ratio of 12.70 and pays a dividend that has a yield as of Oct. 11 of 6.27%, which works out to an annualized payout of $3 per share. In calling SCCO stock one of the top precious metals stocks to own, I concluded that the company’s dividend makes Southern Copper attractive because you’ll get paid to be patient, no matter how long it takes for commodities to rebound.Newmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont (NYSE:NEM) is one of the largest miners in the world. The mining giant is largely known for being a gold miner, In fact, Newmont has over 96 million ounces of gold reserves. But the company is also become one of the world’s leading copper miners.That’s significant because at this time, investors should be prioritizing quality when considering which stocks to hang onto for the long haul. And Newmont qualifies as such with a solid balance sheet that includes a total liquidity buffer of $7.3 billion.Given the steep decline in commodity prices, it’s not surprising that NEM stock is down sharply from its 52-week (and all-time) high set in April 2022. That said, this environment is now making the stock look like an attractive value bet. This valuation, combined with Newmont’s dividend yield of 5.2% and annualized payout of $2.20, makes NEM stock a top copper stock to buy right now.Freeport McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comFreeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX) makes this list of copper stocks to buy, as it is one of the leading copper miners in the world. That said, Freeport is another diverse mining operation. In addition to copper production, Freeport also engages in gold mining and is a major producer of the rare earth metal molybdenum which is a critical alloy for steel.This gives the company several potential revenue streams, and the company clearly believes that copper is one of them. In fact, the company cited the S&amp;P Global study mentioned in the introduction to this article in offering a bullish outlook for copper demand in the next 10 to 15 years.Like many miners, Freeport McMoRan is currently caught in a push-pull scenario. On the one hand, public policy and private sector initiatives point to strong demand. On the other hand, the macroeconomic picture includes several headwinds. To begin with, inflation remains at elevated levels. This in turn is forcing interest rates to move higher. Accordingly, these factors in aggregate appears to point to weakening consumer demand.That means that the short-term outlook for FCX stock is likely to remain muddled. The company’s mid- to long-term outlook, on the other hand, looks far more favorable.BHP Group (BHP)Stacks of copper tubingSource: ShutterstockNext on this list of copper stocks to buy is one of the top Australian stocks in the market. Australia is known for its vast supply of natural resources. And BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) mines many of those resources, including nickel and potash.Russia’s war with Ukraine makes the company’s access to potash a compelling reason to buy the stock. However, the focus of this article is copper. And the company plans to increase its capital expenditure to meet the global demand for copper. This makes BHP stock a compelling choice for investors looking to benefit from undervalued stocks that offer the benefit of international exposure.Additionally, the company’s fundamentals suggest that it’s an undervalued choice as well. The company’s P/E ratio of 5.7-times is low, even in a sector where P/E values tend to average below 10-times earnings. Thus, while I wouldn’t count on the company maintaining a dividend yield of 13.93%, BHP stock currently offers a $6.97 per share annualized payout that income-oriented investors should not dismiss.Turquoise Hill (TRQ)a cart filed with gold in a gold mineSource: ShutterstockInvestors could just as easily put Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), the parent company of Turquoise Hill (NYSE:TRQ), on this list. Indeed, the former has given Turquoise Hill $2.3 billion in funding to complete its underground gold-copper mine at Oyu Tolgoi in Southern Mongolia. But in the interest of giving investors some alternatives, Turquoise Hill Resources is a mid-cap company with its own merits.For starters, the company is projected to grow revenue and earnings at double-digit rates over the next five years. With many analysts are forecasting an earnings recession for many companies, this isn’t something to quickly dismiss. Investors may learn more about a potential earnings slowdown when the company reports earnings in early November.In the meantime, the stock trades at a P/E of just over 10-times earnings. That makes it slightly overvalued to the sector, and investors don’t get a dividend with TRQ stock. Still, if the company’s forecasts for revenue and earnings come to fruition, this stock will look like a deep value pick at its current price.Copper Mountain Mining (CPPMF)Copper ingots in a stack on a white background. Copper stocks.Source: ppart / ShutterstockThe last single stock on this list of copper stocks to buy is the Copper Mountain Mining (OTCMKTS:CPPMF). As you can see by the over-the-counter designation, this is a penny stock, but one that may be worth considering as part of a broader precious metals portfolio.CPPMF got a huge tailwind from the anticipated demand increase brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the stock fell in lock-step with the price of commodities starting in early April. In the last month, however, the stock is up 9%. And that gain is even larger when you consider that it was trading for 93 cents a share in late September.The reason for the renewed optimism is due to the conclusions of a technical report that forecasts a larger amount of reserves than previous estimates and a longer life for its flagship mine. This in turn allowed the company to raise its production estimates. The company now believes it will produce approximately 138 million pounds of copper equivalent on an annual basis beginning in 2023. That’s a 38% increase from the current annual production run rater of approximately 100 million pounds.Global X Copper Miners ETF (COPX)Blocks that spell out ETF in front of jar with money and change.Source: SHUN_J / ShutterstockExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a low-risk way for investors to get exposure to a particular sector. Accordingly, a great choice for gaining exposure to some of the best copper mining stocks (including many on this list) is through the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:COPX).This is the first ETF to give investors a pure-play option for investing in copper. The fund tracks a market-cap-weighted index that offers broad exposure to the entire industry. The methodology ranks companies by their average daily trading volume with respect to their corresponding exchanges over the past three months. If international exposure is important to you, it should be noted that the fund is heavily weighted to North American companies (about 40%), and is balanced semi-annually.The ETF currently has about $1.40 billion of assets under management and an expense ratio of 0.65%.Penny StocksOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$49.37 and falling to the lows of US$39.27. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Cisco Systems' current trading price of US$40.20 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Cisco Systems’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems What Is Cisco Systems Worth?Good news, investors! Cisco Systems is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Cisco Systems’s ratio of 13.98x is below its peer average of 21.91x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Communications industry. Cisco Systems’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta.
