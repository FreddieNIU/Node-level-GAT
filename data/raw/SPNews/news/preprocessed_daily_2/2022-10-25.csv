Range has unlocked a massive inventory of high-quality wells in the Marcellus, measured in decades, and translated that inventory into a business capable of generating healthy free cash flow and returns of capital through the cycles. As a result of Range’s organic operational and financial performance, commitment to disciplined spending and confidence in free cash flow sustainability, we are tripling our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. We continue to view share repurchases as a compelling investment, given favorable long-term fundamentals and the underlying value of our de-risked multi-decade core inventory. This repeatable, low-risk, low-decline asset base underpins Range’s peer-leading capital intensity and resilient free cash flow profile.”Financial DiscussionExcept for generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) reported amounts, specific expense categories exclude non-cash impairments, unrealized mark-to-market adjustment on derivatives, non-cash stock compensation and other items shown separately on the attached tables. “Unit costs” as used in this release are composed of direct operating, transportation, gathering, processing and compression, production, and ad valorem taxes, general and administrative, interest and depletion, depreciation and amortization costs divided by production. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of each of the non-GAAP financial measures and the tables that reconcile each of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.Story continuesThird Quarter 2022 ResultsGAAP revenues for third quarter 2022 totaled $1.1 billion, GAAP net cash provided from operating activities (including changes in working capital) was $521 million, and GAAP net income was $373 million ($1.49 per diluted share).  Third quarter earnings results include a $458 million mark-to-market derivative loss due to the increases in commodity prices.Non-GAAP revenues for third quarter 2022 totaled $1.1 billion, and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, a non-GAAP measure, was $550 million.  Adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates, a non-GAAP measure, was $336 million ($1.37 per diluted share) in third quarter 2022.The following table details Range’s third quarter 2022 unit costs per mcfe(a):Expenses 3Q 2022 (per mcfe) 2Q 2022(per mcfe)  Increase (Decrease)       Direct operating $0.11  $0.10  10%Transportation, gathering,           processing and compression(a)  1.65   1.70  (3%)Production and ad valorem taxes  0.04   0.04  0%General and administrative(a)  0.16   0.17  (6%)Interest expense(a)  0.19   0.21  (10%)Total cash unit costs(b)  2.15   2.22  (3)%Depletion, depreciation and           amortization (DD&amp;A)  0.46   0.46  0%Total unit costs plus DD&amp;A(b) $ 2.61  $ 2.68  (3)% (a)Excludes stock-based compensation, one-time settlements, and amortization of deferred financing costs. (b)May not add due to rounding.   The following table details Range’s average production and realized pricing for third quarter 2022(a): 3Q22 Production &amp; Realized Pricing  Natural Gas(Mcf) Oil(Bbl) NGLs(Bbl) Natural GasEquivalent(Mcfe)         Net production per day  1,487,640   7,098   100,387   2,132,550          Average NYMEX price $8.19  $91.55  $36.83   Differential, including basis hedging  (0.38)  (6.86)  (1.53)  Realized prices before NYMEX hedges  7.81   84.69   35.30   7.40 Settled NYMEX hedges  (3.39)  (29.28)  0.44   (2.45)Average realized prices after hedges $ 4.42  $ 55.41  $ 35.74  $ 4.95  (a)May not add due to rounding   Third quarter 2022 natural gas, NGLs and oil price realizations (including the impact of cash-settled hedges and derivative settlements) averaged $4.95 per mcfe.The average natural gas price, including the impact of basis hedging, was $7.81 per mcf, or a ($0.38) per mcf differential to NYMEX. Natural gas realizations for Range have remained strong in recent months, and as a result, the Company is improving guidance for average 2022 natural gas differentials versus NYMEX to an expected range of ($0.30) to ($0.35) per mcf.Range’s pre-hedge NGL price for 3Q was $35.30 per barrel, an increase of $1.25 versus the prior year quarter and approximately $1.53 below the Mont Belvieu weighted equivalent. During the third quarter, the spread between European naphtha and Mont Belvieu ethane prices decreased considerably. This change in relative pricing for a portion of Range’s sales was the primary driver of Range’s discount to Mont Belvieu for the quarter. The Company expects a slight improvement to its fourth quarter differential and further improvement into 2023 based on forward commodity pricing.Crude oil and condensate price realizations, before realized hedges, averaged $84.69 per barrel, or $6.86 below WTI (West Texas Intermediate). Range continues to expect the 2022 condensate differential to average $6.00-$8.00 below WTI.Financial Position and Share BuybackDuring the third quarter, Range purchased 5.7 million shares at an average price of approximately $29.41 per share. On October 21st, Range’s Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion increase to the Company’s share repurchase program. Range currently has approximately 242 million shares outstanding and $1.2 billion of availability on the share repurchase program.As of September 30, 2022, Range had net debt outstanding of approximately $2.2 billion, consisting of $2.4 billion of senior notes and $157 million in cash. On a trailing twelve-month basis, Range’s leverage ratio, defined as Net-Debt-to-EBITDAX, was approximately 1.0x, with further improvement expected over the coming quarters.Capital ExpendituresThird quarter 2022 drilling and completion expenditures were $133 million. In addition, during the quarter, $5 million was invested in acreage leasehold and gathering systems. Third quarter capital spending represents approximately 29% of Range’s total capital budget in 2022. Total capital expenditures year to date were $382 million at the end of the third quarter. Range expects capital expenditures to trend toward the upper end of its full-year 2022 capital spending guidance of $460 million to $480 million.Production and Operational ActivityProduction for third quarter was 2.13 Bcfe per day, representing a 3% increase over second quarter 2022. The Company expects a similar production increase in the fourth quarter. This will place Range near the low-end of annual guidance of 2.12 – 2.16 Bcfe per day, despite unplanned third-party midstream maintenance that impacted third and fourth quarter volumes. The Company is currently producing approximately 2.2 Bcfe per day.The table below summarizes expected 2022 activity regarding the number of wells to sales in each area. Wells TIL3Q 2022 Calendar 2022Planned TIL Remaining2022SW PA Super-Rich0 7 3SW PA Wet8 21 7SW PA Dry4 26 6NE PA Dry6 9 3Total Wells18 63 19Guidance – 2022Capital &amp; Production GuidanceAs previously noted, Range is targeting holding production approximately flat at 2.12 – 2.16 Bcfe per day, approximately 30% attributed to liquids production, with expectations at the lower end of guidance for the full year 2022 given timing of third-party infrastructure maintenance.

Please see the detailed hedging schedule posted on the Range website under Investor Relations - Financial Information.Range has also hedged Marcellus and other basis differentials for natural gas to limit volatility between benchmark and regional prices. The combined fair value of natural gas basis hedges as of September 30, 2022, was a net gain of $23.8 million.Conference Call InformationA conference call to review the financial results is scheduled on Tuesday, October 25 at 8:00 AM Central Time (9:00 AM Eastern Time).

We believe adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates is calculated on the same basis as analysts’ estimates and that many investors use this published research in making investment decisions and evaluating operational trends of the Company and its performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies. Diluted earnings per share (adjusted) as set forth in this release represents adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates on a diluted per share basis. A table is included which reconciles income or loss from operations to adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates and diluted earnings per share (adjusted). On its website, the Company provides additional comparative information on prior periods along with non-GAAP revenue disclosures.Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital (sometimes referred to as “adjusted cash flow”) as defined in this release represents net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital and exploration expense adjusted for certain non-cash compensation items. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is widely accepted by the investment community as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is also useful because it is widely used by professional research analysts in valuing, comparing, rating and providing investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In turn, many investors use this published research in making investment decisions. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. A table is included which reconciles net cash provided by operations to cash flow from operations before changes in working capital as used in this release. On its website, the Company provides additional comparative information on prior periods for cash flow, cash margins and non-GAAP earnings as used in this release.The cash prices realized for oil and natural gas production, including the amounts realized on cash-settled derivatives and net of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, is a critical component in the Company’s performance tracked by investors and professional research analysts in valuing, comparing, rating and providing investment recommendations and forecasts of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In turn, many investors use this published research in making investment decisions. Due to the GAAP disclosures of various derivative transactions and third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, such information is now reported in various lines of the income statement. The Company believes that it is important to furnish a table reflecting the details of the various components of each income statement line to better inform the reader of the details of each amount and provide a summary of the realized cash-settled amounts and third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, which were historically reported as natural gas, NGLs and oil sales. This information is intended to bridge the gap between various readers’ understanding and fully disclose the information needed.The Company discloses in this release the detailed components of many of the single line items shown in the GAAP financial statements included in the Company’s Annual or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K or 10-Q. The Company believes that it is important to furnish this detail of the various components comprising each line of the Statements of Operations to better inform the reader of the details of each amount, the changes between periods and the effect on its financial results.We believe that the presentation of PV10 value of our proved reserves is a relevant and useful metric for our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure, or after-tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, PV10 can be used within the industry and by credit and security analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis.RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) is a leading U.S. independent natural gas and NGL producer with operations focused on stacked-pay projects in the Appalachian Basin. The Company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas.  More information about Range can be found at www.rangeresources.com.Included within this release are certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect Range’s current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events.  Words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “outlook”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “pursue,” “target,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. All statements, except for statements of historical fact, made within regarding activities, events or developments the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, such as those regarding future well costs, expected asset sales, well productivity, future liquidity and financial resilience, anticipated exports and related financial impact, NGL market supply and demand, improving commodity fundamentals and pricing, future capital efficiencies, future shareholder value, emerging plays, capital spending, anticipated drilling and completion activity, acreage prospectivity, expected pipeline utilization and future guidance information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management's assumptions and Range's future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks and uncertainties is available in Range's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless required by law, Range undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date they are made. The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are estimates that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions as well as the option to disclose probable and possible reserves. Range has elected not to disclose its probable and possible reserves in its filings with the SEC. Range uses certain broader terms such as ""resource potential,” “unrisked resource potential,” ""unproved resource potential"" or ""upside"" or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible reserves as defined by the SEC's guidelines. Range has not attempted to distinguish probable and possible reserves from these broader classifications. The SEC’s rules prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC these broader classifications of reserves. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized. Unproved resource potential refers to Range's internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or recovery techniques and have not been reviewed by independent engineers. Unproved resource potential does not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer's Petroleum Resource Management System and does not include proved reserves. Area wide unproven resource potential has not been fully risked by Range's management. “EUR”, or estimated ultimate recovery, refers to our management’s estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be recovered from a well completed as a producer in the area. These quantities may not necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or the SEC’s oil and natural gas disclosure rules. Actual quantities that may be recovered from Range's interests could differ substantially. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Range's drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, commodity prices, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, field spacing rules, recoveries of gas in place, length of horizontal laterals, actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors. Estimates of resource potential may change significantly as development of our resource plays provides additional data. In addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price declines or drilling cost increases. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, available from our website at www.rangeresources.com or by written request to 100 Throckmorton Street, Suite 1200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. You can also obtain this Form 10-K on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.SOURCE: Range Resources CorporationRange Investor Contact:Laith Sando, Vice President –

7,350533dd-ed7e-3c2e-a9b4-f98196708740,NUE,2022-10-25,Do Nucor's (NYSE:NUE) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucors-nyse-nue-earnings-warrant-140205282.html,1666620125,STORY,['NUE'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Nucor (NYSE:NUE). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Nucor with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor How Fast Is Nucor Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Nucor has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Outstandingly, Nucor's EPS shot from US$16.53 to US$33.35, over the last year. Year on year growth of 102% is certainly a sight to behold. That could be a sign that the business has reached a true inflection point.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Nucor shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 22% to 27%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Nucor.Story continuesAre Nucor Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Nucor, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$256m. This comes in at 0.7% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Nucor, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.Nucor's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$12m in the year leading up to December 2021. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is Nucor Worth Keeping An Eye On?Nucor's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. An added bonus for those interested is that management hold a heap of stock and the CEO pay is quite reasonable, illustrating good cash management. The strong EPS improvement suggests the businesses is humming along. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that Nucor is worth considering carefully. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Nucor (at least 1 which is concerning)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

8,6afdba10-6052-3ee8-a879-56dad73131e9,NUE,2022-10-25,The 7 Best Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-stocks-buy-august-174423988.html,1666379123,STORY,"['NUE', 'CVX', 'DIS', '^GSPC', 'MOH', 'COST', 'GNRC']","[Looking for the best stocks to buy for November is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. There are so many possibilities that it’s hard to pick just seven stocks.While the markets are down significantly in 2022, the S&amp;P 500 is coming off one of its best months of the year, with the index gaining nearly 8% in October. As far as I know, in 2022, only July, when the S&amp;P rose 9.1%, was a better month for the index in 2022. A little more than halfway through November, the index has carried on where it left off, as it was up 3.2% for the month as of yesterday’s close.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCan you say, “rally?” The seven best stocks to buy in November are companies whose businesses are performing well but have yet to be rewarded by investors for their excellent work. The seven names are from seven sectors. Each of the stocks is trading at a reasonable price-sales ratio and has a return on invested capital of 15% or higher.Here are my seven best stocks to buy for November 2022.WSMWilliams-Sonoma$127GOOG,GOOGLAlphabet$99,$98.90FANGDiamondback Energy$159MOHMolina Healthcare$313NUENucor$141.60MMIMarcus &amp; Millichap$37.20MEDMedifast$119Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mallSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comOne company that has managed to avoid the weakness of e-commerce businesses  is Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), the home furnishing and kitchenware retailer. Like most stocks, WSM hasn’t fared well in 2022, as it’s down 24% in 2022.To make matters worse, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski downgraded the company in late October to an “underperform” rating from “hold,” as he thinks that furniture spending among the upper-middle class may come to a screeching halt in the event of a recession. As a result, WSM’s revenues and profits will fall, the analyst predicted.“Based on these prior recessions, going forward, we believe it’s not unreasonable to expect the furniture spend for WSM ’s core demographic to decline in the [mid-single digit percentage] range next year,” Barron’s reported the analyst as saying in his Oct. 24 research note. Story continuesWorse still, he cut his target on WSM by $60 to $100.Is the analyst right?Williams-Sonoma’s revenues dropped 15% from $3.94 billion in 2007 to $3.36 billion in 2008, a 14.8% decline YOY. They fell again in 2009, before rebounding by 12.9% in 2010. So there’s a risk that the company’s business will be hurt by a recession. However, keep in mind that its gross margins today are close to  the mid-40s. Before the Great Financial Crisis, the highest they got was 39.9% in 2006. Buy some WSM stock and then buy more shares if it falls into the low $100s or high double digits. Over the long term, its CEO, Laura Alber, has always delivered the goods. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comThe 47 analysts who cover Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have an average rating of “buy” on the shares, and their median target price on the name is $126.11. Its return on invested capital is 23.68%, while its price–sales ratio is 4.51, The latter ratio is 31% lower than the five-year average of GOOG stock. Before describing the positive aspects of Alphabet, I will note that UK-based investor TCI Fund Management Ltd. yesterday disclosed its open letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. In the document, TCI requested that the company cut jobs and reduce the amount it spends on its employees. TCI believes that Alphabet has unnecessarily grown its headcount by an average of 20% annually over the past five years.  Alphabet’s shares rose on the news. Sometimes it’s good to have an activist investor applying a little pressure on a company’s management. On a positive note, YouTube appointed Leo Olebe as its head of gaming in October after an eight-month search. Olebe was most recently Google Play’s head of games partnerships. Olebe has more than 20 years of experience in the gaming industry.Gaming is a big part of YouTube. In Q2 , consumers spent 1.13 billion hours on YouTube Gaming. YouTube as a whole generated more than $28 billion of revenue for Alphabet in 2021, up from $1.3 billion a decade ago. Since YouTube launched YouTube Premium in 2018, the latter service’s annual subscriber base jumped fivefold to 50 million in 2021. The hiring of Olebe should keep YouTube on the path to greater revenues and profits, helping to lift GOOG stock in the process. Diamondback Energy (FANG)diamondback energy logo on its website to represent oil stocksSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comThe 32 analysts who  cover Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) have an average rating of “buy” on the company, and their average price target on the name is $180.37. Its return on invested capital is 23.76%, while its price-sales ratio is 3.02, The latter ratio is 35% lower than the five-year average for FANG.Diamondback is one of the biggest independent oil and natural gas companies operating in the Permian Basin in West Texas. FANG and FANG stock are both on a roll. On Oct. 11, the company announced that it would buy Firebird Energy LLC for $1.6 billion of cash ($775 million) and stock (5.86 million shares). Firebird has more than 350 locations that are adjacent to Diamondback’s holdings in Midland, Texas. The purchase adds more than a decade of oil inventories to Diamondback’s assets. Firebird’s properties generate 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The latter metric is expected to increase by nearly 3,000 barrels in 2023. FANG generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in Q3 and $3.2 billion of free cash flow in the 12 months that ended on Sept. 30. In Q3, it declared a permanent cash dividend of 75 cents a share. It also announced a special cash dividend of $1.51 a share. Its current dividend of $2.26 yields 9.2%. In addition to paying out $526 million of dividends to shareholders in Q3, it also repurchased $472 million of its own stock.FANG Stock is up nearly 50% in 2022.Molina Healthcare (MOH)The logo for Molina Healthcare displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comOn Molina Healthcare’s (NYSE:MOH) Q2 earnings conference call, CEO Joe Zubretsky announced that all of MOH’s employees would permanently work from home. As a result, it is reducing its real estate footprint by approximately two-thirds. The move will lower its general and administrative expenses in the years ahead. Molina Healthcare provides Medicaid and Medicare healthcare plans to lower-income individuals through state insurance marketplaces. At the end of September, it had 5.2 million members, 7% higher than in June 2021. The company continues implementing a turnaround strategy that includes acquiring smaller healthcare plans.  In the first nine months of 2022, Molina’s profit, excluding some items, climbed 30% to $808 million versus the same period a year earlier. For all of 2022, it expects earnings of $17.75 a share. In May, I identified Molina as a blue-chip stock to buy for safety. MOH stock is flat since then. More importantly, since hitting a 52-week low of $249.78 in mid-June, it’s up nearly 25%. The 16 analysts who cover Molina have an average rating of “overweight” on it, and an average target price of $367.53. Its return on invested capital is 17.93%, while its price-sales ratio is 0.59, which is in-line with its five-year average. Nucor (NUE)a steel frame for a buildingSource: ShutterstockI’ve admired  Nucor (NYSE:NUE), a North Carolina-based steel producer for some time. In March, I recommended NUE, along with nine other S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. I also recommended NUE’s shares in September 2021 because I thought they were down, but not out. While the past year has been a rollercoaster ride for Nucor’s shareholders, the stock’s performance has been very positive. In the last 12 month, the shares are up 29% compared to the 15% decline of the S&amp;P 500 index. In the month that ended yesterday, NUE was up 18%, more than double the return of the S&amp;P 500. In mid-September, the company’s shares tumbled after it announced that its Q3 profits would be significantly below analysts’ average estimates and lower than those in the previous quarter. Within a couple of weeks, its shares fell to $100. When Nucor reported its Q3 results on Oct. 20, they were better than the company’s September guidance, with its earnings per share coming in at $6.50, 10 cents above the high end of its guidance range. “Nucor has already achieved a record-breaking year for earnings per share through the first nine months of 2022 and we continue to believe that we will set a new record for full-year earnings in 2022,” the firm stated in its Oct. 20 press release.The analysts aren’t sold on Nue. The 13 analysts who cover Nucor have a “hold” rating on it, and their average price target is $131.92, below where it is currently trading. Its return on invested capital is 40.03%, while its price-sales ratio is 0.89, in-line with the company’s five-year average. There is no question that Nucor’s results will not be as good in 2023 as they were in 2022. Nucor’s return on invested capital is more than double its five-year average of 18.57%.  Despite likely reverting to the mean over the next 6-12 months, Nucor remains an excellent long-term buy. Marcus &amp; Millichap (MMI)An image of two people with a housing contract, hands holding a pen, hands holding a calculator with a house in the backgroundSource: 89stocker / ShutterstockMarcus &amp; Millichap (NYSE:MMI) is where businesses  go when they need to sell commercial properties. It has been getting properties bought and sold since 1971. In  Q3, MMI had a so-so quarter, reflecting rising interest rates, which negatively affects real estate transactions. MMI, however, can make some hay in the private-client market. “The size and fragmentation of the Private Client Market segment continues to offer long-term growth opportunities through consolidation,” stated its Q3 2022 press release. “This highly fragmented market segment consistently accounts for 80% of all commercial property sales transactions and over 59% of the commission pool. The top 10 brokerage firms, led by MMI, have an estimated 21% share of this segment by transaction count.”The “private client market” refers to commercial real estate properties that cost between $1 million and $10 million. They account for 85% of Marcus &amp; Millichap’s transactions and 58% of its commissions.  With zero debt and a strong balance sheet, MMI has an opportunity to grow the market share of its most important segment.And its return on invested capital is a healthy 20.91%, 4.29 percentage points higher than its five-year average, while its price-sales ratio is 0.99, almost 50% below its five-year average. Call this my contrarian pick.Medifast (MED)Source: ShutterstockMedifast (NYSE:MED, which focuses on health and wellness, is probably best known for its Optavia weight-loss program. Over the past five years, Optavia’s revenues have grown by more than 455%, while its overall revenue has tripled over the past three years to $1.53 billion. Yet MED stock has underperformed the index by more than 34 percentage points over the past year, during which the shares have sunk nearly 50%. Inflation has consumers picking and choosing what they spend their money on. Weight loss coaches and programs aren’t a priority for most, even though they probably should be, given the importance  of avoiding obesity. For all of 2022, Medifast’s revenue guidance range calls for  $1.55 billion of sales at the midpoint , while it expects to earn $12.33 a share, excluding some items.It finished Q3 with nearly $70 million of cash on its balance sheet and no interest-bearing debt. In the first nine months of 2022, it paid out almost $54 million of dividends and bought back $120 million of its stock. If there’s a value play in this column, Medifast is it, with a price-sales ratio of 0.81, less than a third of its five-year average. Recent history has shown that MED stock is volatile.

Recently, AYI broke through the 50-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.One of the three major moving averages, the 50-day simple moving average is commonly used by traders and analysts to determine support or resistance levels for different types of securities. However, the 50-day is considered to be more important since it's the first marker of an up or down trend.AYI has rallied 10.1% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests AYI could be on the verge of another move higher.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider AYI's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 4 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.Given this move in earnings estimate revisions and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on AYI for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

10,45cfc9b3-5195-3a1e-b71c-f372cce9bdea,AYI,2022-10-25,Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Acuity Brands a Decade Ago,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-youd-invested-1000-123012270.html,1666614612,STORY,['AYI'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Acuity Brands (AYI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AYI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Acuity Brands' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Acuity Brands' main business drivers.Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Acuity Brands, Inc. is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (“ABL”) and other subsidiaries. The company manufactures and distributes lighting fixtures and related components that comprise devices such as luminaries, lighting controls, and controllers for various building systems, power supplies, prismatic skylights, and drivers, as well as integrated systems designed to optimize energy efficiency and comfort for various indoor and outdoor applications.The company intended to separate the lighting, lighting controls and components business and intelligent buildings business. In sync with this, during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the company completed the realignment of its business operations and structured into two units: Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls or ABL (accounting for 94.9% of fiscal 2021 net sales) and Intelligent Spaces Group or ISG (5.1%).Additionally, it has expanded its solutions portfolio, including software and services, that benefits economy in data analytics that enables the Internet of Things (“IoT”); supports the advancement of smart buildings, cities, and grid; and allows businesses to develop custom applications to scale their operations.The portfolio of lighting solutions comprises lighting products utilizing fluorescent, light emitting diode (LED), organic LED (OLED), high intensity discharge, metal halide, and incandescent light sources to illuminate a number of applications.Acuity Brands provides lighting solutions for commercial, institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications throughout North America and as well as Europe and Asia. The company has one reportable segment serving the North American and select international markets.The company has a wide variety of brands that include Lithonia Lighting, Holophane, Peerless, Gotham, Mark Architectural Lighting, Winona Lighting, Juno, Indy, Aculux, Healthcare Lighting, Hydrel, American Electric Lighting, Antique Street Lamps, Sunoptics, eldoLED, Distech Controls, nLight, ROAM, Sensor Switch, Power Sentry, IOTA, and Atrius.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Acuity Brands, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $2,746.37, or a gain of 174.64%, as of October 24, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 161.85% and gold's return of -6.50% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for AYI.Acuity Brands’ shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. The trend is likely to continue, backed by strong fourth-quarter and fiscal 2022 results. The top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased on a year-over-year basis. Higher sales from both the segments, along with price increases and product and productivity improvements, drove the results. Also, a diversified portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy-efficient luminaries adds to the positives. However, gross and adjusted operating margins contracted 50 basis points (bps) each in the fiscal fourth quarter due to higher material, labor and freight costs. For fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to be within $4.1-$4.3 billion. Adjusted earnings are likely to be in the range of $13-$14.50 per share.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 10.07%, and there have been 4 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

11,9db6f67c-f495-388f-ad4a-85615ec89f3a,ARE,2022-10-25,"Are Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.'s (NYSE:ARE) Fundamentals Good Enough to Warrant Buying Given The Stock's Recent Weakness?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alexandria-real-estate-equities-inc-114458281.html,1666698298,STORY,['ARE'],"[With its stock down 15% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Alexandria Real Estate Equities (NYSE:ARE). But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. In this article, we decided to focus on Alexandria Real Estate Equities'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Alexandria Real Estate Equities How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alexandria Real Estate Equities is:2.0% = US$416m ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.02 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Alexandria Real Estate Equities' Earnings Growth And 2.0% ROEAs you can see, Alexandria Real Estate Equities' ROE looks pretty weak. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 6.6%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Despite this, surprisingly, Alexandria Real Estate Equities saw an exceptional 27% net income growth over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Alexandria Real Estate Equities' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 11% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ARE? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Alexandria Real Estate Equities Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Alexandria Real Estate Equities has a very high three-year median payout ratio of 51%. This means that it has only 49% of its income left to reinvest into its business. However, it's not unusual to see a REIT with such a high payout ratio mainly due to statutory requirements. Despite this, the company's earnings have grown significantly as we saw above.Additionally, Alexandria Real Estate Equities has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 62% over the next three years. However, Alexandria Real Estate Equities' future ROE is expected to rise to 3.0% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Alexandria Real Estate Equities certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Namely, its high earnings growth. We do however feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings and paid out less dividends. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

This compares to FFO of $1.95 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 0.47%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this life science real estate company would post FFO of $2.06 per share when it actually produced FFO of $2.10, delivering a surprise of 1.94%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Alexandria Real Estate Equities , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $659.85 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.30%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $547.76 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Alexandria Real Estate Equities shares have lost about 40.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.3%.What's Next for Alexandria Real Estate Equities?While Alexandria Real Estate Equities has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alexandria Real Estate Equities: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $2.14 on $655.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.42 on $2.55 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the bottom 46% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, One Liberty Properties (OLP), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.This real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Unum Group (NYSE:UNM). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Unum Group Unum Group's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. It certainly is nice to see that Unum Group has managed to grow EPS by 31% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Unum Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. Unfortunately, Unum Group's revenue dropped 10% last year, but the silver lining is that EBIT margins improved from 8.6% to 13%. That falls short of ideal.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Unum Group's forecast profits?Are Unum Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Unum Group has a market capitalisation of US$8.7b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. With a whopping US$50m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Should You Add Unum Group To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Unum Group has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Unum Group's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. Don't forget that there may still be risks.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, recently announced the availability of an initial portfolio of off-the-shelf long-read gene panels — Twist Alliance panels — in collaboration with Twist Bioscience Corporation. These fixed panels have been designed to capture target regions in a cost-effective and high throughput manner. Customers will also have the ability to develop a fully customizable and scalable panel of their design for sequencing with PacBio HiFi reads.PacBio and Twist Bioscience have collaborated with researchers of renowned institutions to develop two Alliance panels. One panel includes coverage of nearly 400 challenging medically relevant genes, while the other was designed to capture 50 pharmacogenomic genes.Apart from new capabilities provided by the long-read panels, PacBio is also collaborating with Twist Bioscience to demonstrate the high level of accuracy that can be achieved using sequencing by binding (SBB) chemistry.This latest availability is expected to significantly expand PacBio’s market share for sequencing, thus strengthening its global foothold.Significance of the AvailabilityPer the press release, many of the challenging genes are in the dark regions of the human genome (the complete set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism), which are difficult to sequence or accurately map using standard short-read sequencing technologies. PacBio and Twist Bioscience developed the dark gene panel with researchers to interrogate and detect around 400 hard-to-sequence genes of medical significance which are associated with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease.PacBio believes that SBB’s accuracy, when applied to whole-exome sequencing, can potentially provide a complete coverage of both uncomplicated and traditionally difficult-to-sequence genes. This, in turn, could streamline workflows by reducing the necessity for orthogonal assays.Story continuesPer PacBio’s management, the partnership with Twist Bioscience enabled it to develop off-the-shelf products that are expected to meet its customers’ needs for a way to focus their long-read experiments and maximize throughput.Twist Bioscience’s management feels that the panels developed in association with PacBio will likely enable customers to sequence regions of the genome that can aid researchers in studying the role of genetics in drug response. This is expected to enable them to uncover regions that are difficult to read, such as dark genes and genes associated with neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Mynewsdesk, the global genome sequencing market is projected to reach $46.43 billion in 2028 from $13.58 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 19.2%. Factors like the rising prevalence of genetic disorders, continued mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the need for disease management are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is expected to significantly strengthen PacBio’s global business.Recent DevelopmentsPacBio, this month, announced the creation of the Consortium for Long Read Sequencing, which aims to accelerate the utility of long-read human genome datasets.Last month, PacBio announced the availability of a new computational analysis method — Tandem Repeat Genotyping Tool — for profiling a huge volume of tandem repeats across the human genome using its long-read HiFi sequencing data.Comparison With PeersPacBio’s peer in the sequencing space, Illumina, Inc.

(CF): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cf-industries-130001648.html,1666616401,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this fertilizer maker have returned +14.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which CF falls in, has lost 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, CF is expected to post earnings of $3.29 per share, indicating a change of +242.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $19.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +362.5%. This estimate has changed +2.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.40 indicates a change of -16.4% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CF is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $2.35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +72.7%. The $11.74 billion and $10 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +79.6% and -14.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $3.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +113.4%. EPS of $6.19 for the same period compares with $1.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -6.27%. The EPS surprise was +2.15%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Cintas (CTAS) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this uniform rental company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Cintas is 17.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 10.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 8.6%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Cintas is 6.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -0.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 18.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Cintas have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.3% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Cintas a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Cintas well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares of Beyond Meat today, wow, yeah, they're down 5% after the plant-based meat company announced the new offering Beyond Steak. Yahoo! Finance's Brooke DiPalma is here with the details. Brooke.BROOKE DIPALMA: That's right, Brad. Beyond Meat looking to cook up some excitement here. We're doing the opposite. As you said, shares down nearly 6% this morning. Of course, some frozen food comes out today, Beyond Steak. It's seared. Its bit-sized pieces. And can be prepared on, what they're saying, either a skillet or an air fryer in just five minutes.Of course, this comes as the frozen food section seeing a bit of a boom here this year. $70 billion sale-- $70 billion in sales happen for the frozen food aisle. That's a 31% jump since 2019.But if you take a closer look at this offering, they're really looking to expand it to a broad audience for meat-lovers, flexitarians alike. It includes 21 grams of protein per serving. They're saying, it's low in saturated fat, zero milligrams of cholesterol.But if you look at where it's being offering, really looking to hit across the US. Today, Beyond Steak's launching at Kroger, Walmart, Albertsons, and Ahold divisions, of course. That's a name that we may not know exactly but have seen, especially here in New York. That includes Stop &amp; Shop, Giant, Food Lion, and FreshDirect.Of course, this adds to the Beyond Meat portfolio. Back in 2020, we saw Beyond Meat and meatballs at Costco. We also see that opportunity at Target. But the Beyond Steak yet to be determined if this would be offered there as well.Of course, Beyond Meat saying here that this was a highly-anticipated expansion to its beef lineup, which now includes burgers, beef, sausage, and meatballs. But yet to be determined, just how excited main street is and Wall Street this morning. Like I said before, down nearly 6% shares of Beyond Meat so not drumming up too much excitement here.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Now, Brooke, yeah, 21 grams of protein call out. Definitely important for folks such as myself and our former Fed correspondent Brian Cheung. But look, Beyond Meat just had a lot of layoffs. How do they launch a product like this?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, that's a great question. Of course, last week, the brand announced it's set to cut 19% of its global workforce. Of course, that included their Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey, who was arrested in late September for allegedly biting a man's nose at an Arkansas football game. In addition to that, if you take a look year-to-date, one year ago, right here, it is down 87%. Now, year-to-date, down 80%.And if you take a look back to their IPO in 2019, it is down 81%. Now, in addition to that, dealing with a lot of other noise out there. On October 18, Beyond Meat and plant-based food maker Don Lee settled a dispute over a previous partnership. Both sides are satisfied with the outcome, according to court filings.But Beyond Meat really looking to push forward, looking to come out with these innovations. Hoping to grab consumers' attention, of course, here. They're keep on pushing on, I guess you could say here. Calling it, once again, a highly-anticipated expansion. Really looking to continue to enthuse and excite consumers about these new offerings.BRAD SMITH: Brooke, while we have you, with all of the expansions that they've been making-- they had been investing so much into taking the operations under their own helm, not licensing, or renting space at other manufacturing kind of practices and at least areas. And so with that in mind, I mean, investors have had to price in how much they're spending of their own money just to make sure that they can bring more of that operation in-house. Is it clear how they're doing in terms of producing all of these new menu items?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, that's a great question. Well, what we can relate that to is the test that they did with McDonald's, in hopes to launch them and McPlant. And while it launch in the UK and Ireland overseas, it's really, you know, TBD on what exactly that will look like, when exactly we might see that nationwide here in the US. So investors really standing by and waiting to see if all these major investments that they're putting out are seeing a return on that share price.BRAD SMITH: Yahoo! Finance's own Brooke DiPalma with the breakdown on Beyond Meat this morning. Appreciate it.]"

And their apparel was a complete flop.I am very-- I'm gonna be very vast fascinated to see how a brand like this does inside of a Walmart, which really for the past 10 years since that really dreadful push into fashion, has just been focused on very affordable, cheap basics. Now, I don't know the prices on these, but this looks a little bit more fashionable than I think Walmart is known for.BRAD SMITH: It's all about the homegrown brands. I mean, Walmart, of course, has some big partners on the apparel front that has allowed them to move into, you know, of course, all of these storefront locations, brick and mortar, that Walmart dominates in. But then it comes down to, all right, where is Walmart also growing up their own brands?Walmart doing this. Target or Tarjay doing that. Amazon also doing this, too. Amazon has, what, 12 of its own homegrown lines? And so it's really just that ease of knowing you're in the store to perhaps get some of your--[BUZZER BUZZING]--the eggs there.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Raymond James Financial with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Raymond James Financial Raymond James Financial's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Raymond James Financial managed to grow EPS by 13% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Raymond James Financial's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. While we note Raymond James Financial achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 19% to US$11b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Raymond James Financial?Are Raymond James Financial Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Raymond James Financial has a market capitalisation of US$22b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$2.1b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Should You Add Raymond James Financial To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Raymond James Financial is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for Raymond James Financial that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

32,b618794a-1a65-3356-a421-e13d5473d79f,JWN,2022-10-25,Returns On Capital At Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) Paint A Concerning Picture,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-nordstrom-nyse-jwn-153955506.html,1666625995,STORY,['JWN'],"[Ignoring the stock price of a company, what are the underlying trends that tell us a business is past the growth phase? When we see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) in conjunction with a declining base of capital employed, that's often how a mature business shows signs of aging. This reveals that the company isn't compounding shareholder wealth because returns are falling and its net asset base is shrinking. In light of that, from a first glance at Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Nordstrom, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$719m ÷ (US$9.2b - US$3.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).Thus, Nordstrom has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for Nordstrom roceIn the above chart we have measured Nordstrom's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Nordstrom.What Does the ROCE Trend For Nordstrom Tell Us?There is reason to be cautious about Nordstrom, given the returns are trending downwards. About five years ago, returns on capital were 22%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. This combination can be indicative of a mature business that still has areas to deploy capital, but the returns received aren't as high due potentially to new competition or smaller margins. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Nordstrom becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. It should come as no surprise then that the stock has fallen 45% over the last five years, so it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Unless there is a shift to a more positive trajectory in these metrics, we would look elsewhere.On a final note, we found  2 warning signs for Nordstrom (1 is potentially serious)  you should be aware of.While Nordstrom may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

""Ye’s recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company’s values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness. After a thorough review, the company has taken the decision to terminate the partnership with Ye immediately, end production of Yeezy branded products and stop all payments to Ye and his companies. Adidas will stop the adidas Yeezy business with immediate effect.""The parting of ways comes amid increased pressure on social media and among investors for Adidas to move beyond West and its Yeezy line. Adidas stock, down 64% so far in 2022, continued to fall as West's bizarre rants intensified.In ending their relationship, Adidas will have a huge hole to fill financially: The popular Yeezy line represents about $1-$2 billion in annual sales for the company, according to Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad.""We see big risk around the Yeezy franchise,"" Saad said in a recent note to clients.Besides the West drama, Adidas is entering wounded into the holiday season — the latest retailer to get flat-foot operationally as global economies have slowed. That poor execution has primarily led to a glut of Adidas inventory that will have to be aggressively marked down at the expense of profits, the company warned a week ago.Adidas said third quarter sales rose a lackluster 4% in the third quarter excluding the impact of volatile currencies. Sales in China tanked by a double-digit percentage.The company warned (its second warning of the year) that profits would be about 60% lower than its previous expectations.

35,9e7a6fac-d316-30bd-88c2-48c8ed80e9df,XYL,2022-10-25,Xylem (XYL) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xylem-xyl-upgraded-buy-does-160004916.html,1666627204,STORY,['XYL'],"[Xylem (XYL) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Xylem basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Xylem, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for XylemFor the fiscal year ending December 2022, this water and wastewater treatment company is expected to earn $2.58 per share, which is a change of 3.6% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Xylem. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.4%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Xylem to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its share of global coal exports reached 17% last year with supply of 223 million tonnes.But now with more exports heading east towards Asia as opposed to west towards Europe, bottlenecks are appearing.""Many of us were informed by the sellers that there will be delays on loading and arrivals, which causes trouble to our business,"" a Chinese coal trader said.Another source said that some traders were simply told by sellers or miners that a coal shipment was cancelled due to the lack of rail capacity and could be delayed for weeks.Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov has acknowledged the problem with infrastructure constraints, saying this month that the situation with coal exports and congestion on the rail system had not stabilised, though it was improving.China's coal imports from Russia fell to 6.95 million tonnes last month, down from a peak of 8.54 million tonnes in August, according to China's customs data.According to Russian transport industry sources, Russia has increased coal supplies to China by railways by about a third this year, to 27.6 million tonnes in the January-August period.Story continuesWINTER DEMANDBut the increase in cargo traffic has led to slower deliveries.According to a Reuters analysis, it took about 12.6 days to deliver a coal cargo from fields in Siberia, such as Kuzbass, to Russia's Pacific ports in July-September, compared with 11.3 days on average in the same period last year.On average, delivery time across Russia has increased by a fifth, or 1.4 days, according to Reuters analysis of railway data, and timings may increase in the winter due to the railway congestion and port capacity limitations.""We would expect China's coal imports from Russia to decrease due to the cool weather, which will limit port loading, and the rail logistics cap will also help to put a lid on,"" the Chinese coal trader said.Of Russia's total of 223 million tonnes of coal exports last year, 49 million tonnes were delivered to Europe, according to the Energy Ministry.But Russia now expects its coal exports to decline in coming years due to the Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict, and U.S., European Union and British embargos on Russian coal imports.According to Russian government expectations, coal exports may fall by 22% this year and by a further 31% in 2023.But at the same time, the rush of east-bound exports is getting bogged down.""A lot of railcars accumulate, congestion is formed at port stations ... Turnaround times for railcars are increasing significantly. Shippers are looking for empty railcars,"" a Russian transport industry source said.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Russia plans to increase the capacity of its infrastructure, including that of its eastern ports, where capacity is expected to increase by between 55 million tonnes and 211 million tonnes per year by 2031 from 150 million tonnes now.(Reporting by Maxim Nazarov and Gleb Stolyarov in Moscow and Muyu Xu in Singapore; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Robert Birsel)]"

The aim is to build up surpluses for next year and maintain high prices.That policy increases the risk of a global recession, with oil demand set to outpace supply next year, Birol reportedly said at the Singapore Energy Week conference.OPEC+ production cuts are ""especially risky, as several economies around the world are on the brink of a recession,"" the IEA's executive director said.""I found this decision really unfortunate,"" he added.The OPEC+ supply cuts are expected to drive gains in oil prices, which have fallen about 10% in the past three months after soaring immediately after the Ukraine war broke out. Brent crude was 1.2% lower at $90.28 a barrel at last check Tuesday, while WTI crude fell 1.3% to $83.46 a barrel.A rally in crude oil prices would likely cause inflation to rise and both industrial production and growth to fall. The IEA has warned that could tip the global economy into a recession.""With unrelenting inflationary pressures and interest rate hikes taking their toll, higher oil prices may prove the tipping point for a global economy already on the brink of recession,"" the agency said in its most recent monthly oil report.IEA projections show global oil consumption growing by 1.7 million barrels a day in 2023. Russian crude will be needed to bridge the gap between demand and supply, Birol said.Story continuesThe US and the European Union decided to place limited bans on Russian oil imports after President Vladimir Putin's forces invaded Ukraine in late February.But the G7 countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US — have proposed backing up the bans with a price cap on Russian supplies. That would limit Moscow's potential profits from oil exports without fully shutting off deliveries.It's been estimated that these measures would leave space for between 80 and 90% of Russian oil to flow outside of the cap mechanism, which Birol said would help to make up likely supply shortfalls.""I think this is good, because the world still needs Russian oil to flow into the market for now,"" he said.Between 80 and 90% of Russian oil flowing outside the price cap is a ""good and encouraging level in order to meet the demand,"" he added.IEA members have also built up a stockpile of additional oil reserves that can be released onto the market if there's a need to boost supply and drive prices lower, Birol said, per Bloomberg.""We still have a huge amount of stocks to be released in case we see supply disruptions,"" he said. ""Currently, it is not on the agenda, but it can come anytime.""Read more: Biden escalates feud with Saudi Arabia, warning of 'consequences' for cutting oil production in coordination with RussiaRead the original article on Business Insider]"

(NYSE:OMC) Trading At A 50% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omnicom-group-inc-nyse-omc-104652849.html,1666694812,STORY,['OMC'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.54bUS$1.67bUS$1.68bUS$1.57bUS$1.51bUS$1.49bUS$1.47bUS$1.47bUS$1.48bUS$1.50bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ -3.64%Est @ -1.95%Est @ -0.77%Est @ 0.05%Est @ 0.63%Est @ 1.04% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$948US$890US$841US$798(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$11bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.0%) = US$34bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$34b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$18bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$29b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$71.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Omnicom Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.968. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Omnicom Group, there are three relevant items you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - Omnicom Group has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for OMC's future outlook?

This will aid the company to meet the growing consumer demand for sustainable products.The newly launched 9-ounce and 12-ounce cup sizes are currently available at select sports and entertainment venues and are also available for online purchase. They add to Ball Corp's existing 16-ounce, 20-ounce and 24-ounce cup offerings. The full range of sizes will provide customers the opportunity to serve beverages ranging from beer, cocktails, wine, soda, juice and more.Since the Aluminum Cup’s launch in 2019, Ball Corp has witnessed solid demand for the product. The cups are lightweight yet sturdier than single-use plastic cups. Unlike plastic, aluminum can be recycled without losing quality or value. The Ball Aluminum Cup is composed of 90% recycled content — the highest recycled content rate of any beverage packaging in its category.This move is part of BALL Corp’s ongoing endeavors to help customers achieve sustainability goals and solve the overall packaging waste crisis. Customers are increasingly favoring aluminum cans, bottles and cups as those are infinitely recyclable and economically viable. BALL has been expanding its production capacity for a while to capitalize on this demand trend.According to reports, in recent years, 85% of consumers opted for sustainable choices while making their purchases. Ball Corporation and other packaging peers like Amcor Plc  AMCR, Sonoco Products SON, and Sealed Air SEE (to name a few) are thus intensifying their focus on bringing sustainable packaging solutions to consumers.Amcor set the trend as the first global packaging company to pledge to develop all its packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025. AMCR doubled the use of post-consumer recycled resin in the last two years.Sonoco intends to achieve sustainability goals with a significant reduction of carbon emissions and provide customers with environmentally-friendly products.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on PG&amp;E is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.033 = US$3.2b ÷ (US$114b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, PG&amp;E has an ROCE of 3.3%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.4%. See our latest analysis for PG&amp;E roceIn the above chart we have measured PG&amp;E's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for PG&amp;E.What Does the ROCE Trend For PG&amp;E Tell Us?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at PG&amp;E doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 5.9%, but since then they've fallen to 3.3%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWhile returns have fallen for PG&amp;E in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. Despite these promising trends, the stock has collapsed 74% over the last five years, so there could be other factors hurting the company's prospects. Therefore, we'd suggest researching the stock further to uncover more about the business.If you'd like to know more about PG&amp;E, we've spotted   3 warning signs,  and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant.While PG&amp;E isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

59,c6b562d6-ce6f-36eb-9daf-cd1a63862a04,PCG,2022-10-25,Analysts Estimate PSEG (PEG) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-pseg-peg-report-140002329.html,1666620002,STORY,"['PEG', 'PCGU']","[The market expects PSEG (PEG) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. Is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.4%.Revenues are expected to be $2.23 billion, up 17.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.92% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PSEG?For PSEG, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PSEG will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PSEG would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of -1.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PSEG doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, PG&amp;E (PCG) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.24 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.92 billion, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for PG&amp;E has been revised 5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.17%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&amp;E will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

First, we initiated small positions in U.S. natural gas producers Chesapeake (NYSE:CHK).Given its superior environmental profile compared to other fossil fuels, we have long favored natural gas in our energy holdings. Combustion of natural gas releases 50% less CO2 than coal, 25% less CO2 than gasoline and dramatically less particulate and pollution, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. With the advances in shale production this century, the U.S. has become a natural gas powerhouse with some of the lowest-cost and largest reserves in the world. But because natural gas is difficult to ship across the ocean (it must be liquefied, which requires expensive infrastructure on both ends of the voyage), America’s gas bounty has ironically proved a burden for U.S. producers.""

Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range.

(NYSE:JPM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”8.

Shares of Meta Platforms Inc. have lost 61%, their biggest drop since the company went public a decade ago. Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are set for their steepest declines since the global financial crisis.The Nasdaq 100 Index rose 0.6% on Tuesday.Now, these companies are slated to report quarterly results this week with projections showing a profit decline by the most in at least three years. The quintet of stocks together comprise about 40% of the weight of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which has lost $6 trillion of value this year because of supersized interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and the growing potential of a recession.“They are essential to the sentiment around tech, no doubt,” said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. “Investors are now focused on the bottom line and want evidence of lower costs, disciplined spending, and not chasing revenue growth at all costs.”Here’s a look at the Big Tech stocks slated to report this week and what investors are keeping an eye on.AlphabetInvestors are concerned about the strength of the ad market in a weaker economy, a theme that was underlined by weak growth out of Snap Inc. last week. However, analysts are still penciling in full-year revenue growth for Alphabet of about 12%, slightly faster than the S&amp;P 500, with double-digit increases also expected for the next three years.Any sign after the market closes Tuesday that those forecasts are too optimistic could send the stock on another leg down. Keybanc Capital Markets on Monday lowered its estimates for the Google parent, and is now predicting a revenue increase of only 5% for the year.Story continuesThe stock weakness arguably has made Alphabet a bargain, as it trades at just 17 times estimated earnings, a discount to its 10-year average and the Nasdaq 100 overall.MicrosoftThe software giant, which also reports after the close Tuesday, trades at 23 times earnings, a slight premium to its average over the past decade.While demand for its cloud and business software products is expected to be durable, even in the event of a recession, the 9.4% quarterly revenue growth expected by analysts would be its slowest pace since 2017.“The big question mark is, what impact will Microsoft see from the economy slowing and PC weakness?” Wiley Angell, chief market strategist at Ziegler Capital Management. “However, given the overall stability of the revenue and the stock’s valuation, I think this is a good time to be evaluating it.”Meta PlatformsAfter a stock plunge that’s wiped $579 billion off Meta’s value this year, some investors would love to hear Mark Zuckerberg announce at Wednesday’s earnings that he’s dialing back the spending on the company’s push into the metaverse. That expensive gambit has yet to generate meaningful revenue at a time when investors are focused on reducing costs.The Facebook parent has been besieged by stalling user growth, competition from TikTok, and an Apple privacy policy that has diminished its ability to target ads. Also, it’s facing the same weak ad market that pressured Snap.Full-year revenue for is seen falling 0.7%, making it the only company of the five expected to report a decline. This is also set to be the first year of falling revenue in the company’s history. Meta stock trades near its cheapest level on record, though that hasn’t been enough to entice bulls.Amazon.comAmazon reports Thursday afternoon, and the report will be scrutinized as a bellwether across industries. The e-commerce business will shed light into the strength of the consumer, especially going into the holiday shopping season, while its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing division gives a glimpse into how IT spending is holding up.Investors are likely to focus on the progress Amazon is making cutting costs, given the recent preference for profitability over growth. Amazon trades above 40 times estimated earnings, more than twice the Nasdaq 100, though below its long-term average.Amazon is JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s top idea among internet stocks, and it views the valuation as attractive. While analyst Doug Anmuth sees some risks -- including currency headwinds and slowing discretionary spending -- he writes that it “becomes a cleaner story through 2022 as revenue growth re-accelerates &amp; operating income margins expand into 2023.”AppleThe iPhone maker has been the relative winner of 2022, down 15%. Investors have gravitated to it as its steady growth and fortress-strength balance sheet give it a perceived safe-haven status.However, this could leave the stock vulnerable when it reports on Thursday. Bloomberg News recently reported that it is retreating from plans to increase production of its new iPhones given demand trends. The stock also trades at 23 times forward earnings, above both its long-term average and the market overall.“Apple certainly doesn’t look like it is being priced for a recession, and the multiple could be challenged in the short term, given what we’re hearing about softness in the market,” said Angell. “However, the stability of earnings should continue to result in stability in the stock, while providing a higher floor for the multiple.”Tech Chart of the DayTop Tech StoriesApple increased prices for its music and TV+ services for the first time, citing rising licensing costs, a move that risks giving rivals an edge in a fiercely competitive streaming industry.Apple updated its App Store guidelines Monday with new and clearer language explaining its policy toward cryptocurrency trading and non-fungible tokens.WhatsApp, the instant messaging service owned by Meta Platforms Inc. said it fixed an issue that caused a widespread outage, with tens of thousands of users reporting problems.Amazon workers seeking to join a union at a company warehouse in Southern California have backed away from their attempt to hold an election, a setback for the upstart Amazon Labor Union following its defeat at a New York facility last week.The US unsealed charges claiming two Chinese intelligence officers tried to obstruct a criminal investigation of Huawei Technologies Co., and alleged others were working on behalf of a “foreign power” to try procure technology and recruit spies.SoftBank Group Corp.-backed Jellysmack, which helps content creators become YouTube and TikTok stars, is launching a spending spree for growth in Asia, following staff cuts this year.--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.(Updates to market open.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekStudent Debt Headaches Return for Millions Despite Biden ReliefWhat the Alzheimer’s Drug Breakthrough Means for Other DiseasesThe Fantasy of Instant Delivery Is ImplodingFrom Bedrooms to Kitchens, Europe Ponders How Cold Is Too Cold10 Takeaways From Matt Levine’s ‘The Crypto Story’©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Still, it represented a sizable 10% sequential uptick and an even larger 20% Y/Y uptick.“In a dynamic environment we saw strong demand, took share, and increased customer commitment to our cloud platform,” said Amy Hood, CFO, on the company’s most recent cloud results.For the upcoming release, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s cloud revenue sits at $20.3 billion, suggesting a 3% sequential decrease.Share Performance &amp; ValuationMicrosoft shares have underperformed the general market by a fair margin in 2022, down nearly 27%, vs. the S&amp;P 500’s decline of roughly 21%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOver the last three months, however, MSFT shares have primarily traded in line with the general market, as shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn a relative basis, Microsoft shares are at a cheap price point; the company’s 24.2X forward earnings multiple is well beneath its five-year median of 28.5X and nowhere near 2021 highs of 37.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMSFT carries a Style Score of a C for Value.Quarterly EstimatesAnalysts have been bearish in their earnings outlook, with five negative earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last several months.

Still, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric indicates a slight sequential decline.It will be a significant part of the company’s quarterly print, as cloud computing has quickly become a critical technology that an extensive list of companies is shifting toward.Microsoft has consistently exceeded earnings expectations, with nine EPS beats across its last ten quarters.However, the one miss out of the previous ten came in its latest quarterly report, when MSFT fell short of earnings expectations by 2%.Still, it’s worth noting that shares have moved upward following each of its last four quarterly prints, telling us that the market has liked what it’s seen.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

70,6a2a1636-2291-36db-8401-a59ec9113d33,MSFT,2022-10-25,Microsoft powers up search for Chinese gaming hits in race against Sony,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-powers-search-chinese-gaming-230647828.html,1666652807,STORY,"['MSFT', '6758.T']","[By Josh YeHONG KONG (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is stocking up on Chinese video game content to emulate Sony Group Corp's success with ""Genshin Impact"", sources said, solidifying China's transition from a land only of players to a hub of blockbuster developers.The U.S. software giant and Japan's vanguard of technology have for some years been offering big money to small developers to nurture programmes and licence titles, but the impact of ""Genshin Impact"" has added a sense of urgency, sources said.The action role-playing game from budding Shanghai studio miHoYo has generated billions of dollars since its release two years ago, and raised the bar in multi-player, cross-platform games - the type sources said Microsoft and Sony seek in China for their Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscription services.Growing Western interest in Chinese games reflects a maturing of China's game development industry, analysts said. Chinese games are now on a par with big-budget Western games, said Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at researcher Niko Partners.""Chinese game developers are trying to standardise their development tools, create advanced production processes, invest in really large-scale teams,"" Ahmad said. ""Ultimately, that helps provide them with the competitive edge to reach a broad audience both in terms of geography and platforms.""Microsoft has been building a team to scout for Chinese games, two industry sources said. The Xbox maker mainly filled its subscription roster with big-brand titles but is now wooing even independent studios with big-money offers, they said.At the same time, filings showed Microsoft is expanding its subscription service to personal computers and handheld devices, increasing the appeal of Chinese developers such as miHoYo which have developed a reputation for multi-player, cross-platform compatibility - with ""Genshin Impact"" being a prime example.Story continuesOne executive, whose studio signed a licensing deal with Microsoft three years ago to feature its game on Game Pass, said the U.S. firm recently offered a licensing deal many times bigger for a sequel.""We are not signing it yet because we think that when we fully complete our game, it will get an even better offer,"" the executive said.Illustrating the money involved, filings showed Microsoft paid $2.5 million to feature action game ""ARK: Survival Evolved"" on Game Pass and $2.3 million for sequel ARK 2 - both from U.S. developer Studio Wildcard, owned by China's Snail Games.An executive at another developer, Recreate Games in Shanghai, said his company signed a deal with Microsoft last year for its upcoming multi-player title ""Party Animals"" to launch exclusively on Xbox.""Xbox contacted many projects in China and these projects primarily focus on developing console and PC games,"" said Chief Executive Luo Zixiong.Microsoft did not respond to emailed requests for comment.PLAYING CATCH-UPMicrosoft was slower off the mark in China compared with Sony. The Japanese firm launched gaming accelerator programme ""China Hero Project"" in 2017 aimed at helping Chinese developers publish games on its PlayStation. It has supported 17 titles of which seven have reached the market.""We've been quiet for the past two years. But the programme is still very much humming along,"" Kuangyi Zhou, former manager of the China Hero Project, told Reuters in April. ""We are proud of all the games which have successfully emerged from the programme... There is no doubt that a new batch will be coming.""In 2019, Sony partnered miHoYo, a little-known studio which was developing ""Genshin Impact"". The game - a global hit when it was released a year later - is available for personal computers and handheld devices, but the console version is exclusively on PlayStation.Microsoft regretted missing out on ""Genshin Impact"", two people familiar with the matter said. It spoke to miHoYo early in the game's development but did not reach a deal, one of them said. The other person said the experience is the driving force behind Microsoft's more active pursuit of Chinese developers.""Picking up 'Genshin Impact' made Sony a lot of money,"" the second person said, declining to be identified because the information was not public.There is no public data on console revenue from ""Genshin Impact"", but data from Sensor Tower put the figure at $3 billion for mobile devices as of May.MARKET EVOLUTIONFor much of the 21st century, Chinese gamers mostly played imported titles as home-grown games were viewed as being poorer in production value. Even Chinese gaming leader Tencent Holdings Ltd started out publishing foreign games at home.As the market grew into the world's largest, local studios increasingly invested in developing better-quality games. The trend accelerated with regulatory restrictions on new games and limits on the number of imports, and benefited from the return of engineers who had worked at top-tier studios such as Ubisoft Entertainment SA and Activision Blizzard Inc.Gaming executives now point to ""Genshin Impact"" as a global industry milestone, lauding its production value and seamless cross-platform game play. Apple Inc even used the game to demonstrate the power of its premium devices including the new iPad Air equipped with its latest M1 processor chip.Another milestone was 2021's ""Naraka: Bladepoint"" from NetEase Inc, China's second-largest games firm. While most Chinese titles are free to play and profit from in-game sales, ""Naraka: Bladepoint"" sold over 10 million copies despite its $20 price, reflecting confidence in its production value.The game caught the attention of both Microsoft and Sony, two sources told Reuters. One of them said NetEase prioritised Microsoft which made the game a Game Pass exclusive in June.(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Christopher Cushing)]"

Alongside this, it launched a loyalty program to improve front-end margins, expanded its brands and enhanced PBM margins via its new rebate aggregation agreement. The company has been making efforts to grow the Elixir membership and reposition its approach to the Elixir Insurance Part D business.In a recent development, RAD launched 546 newly designed products. It expects to launch more in the second half of this year. The company also remains on track with the plans to open small-format pharmacies in underserved rural markets such as Indiana, upstate New York and Virginia.The company revealed plans to lower costs via the closures of 145 unprofitable stores, reduced corporate administrative expenses and enhanced efficiencies in worked payroll, and other store labor costs. It intends to reduce costs related to Elixir due to declining membership. The cost initiatives are expected to generate $190 million in savings in fiscal 2023.Driven by these factors, management issued an upbeat sales view for fiscal 2023. The company anticipates revenues of $23.6-$24 million. The Retail Pharmacy segment’s revenues are likely to be $17.35-$17.65. The Pharmacy Services segment’s revenues are expected to be $6.25-$6.35 billion.Hurdles on the WayRite Aid is currently witnessing muted demand for COVID-19 tests and vaccines. This, along with the adverse impacts of closed stores, and lower membership at Elixir, remains concerning. This led to sluggishness in the Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments. In second-quarter fiscal 2023, the Retail Pharmacy segment's revenues fell 1.1%, while the Pharmacy Services segment’s revenues declined 9% year over year.Also, the company expects weak consumer demand and supply-chain headwinds to persist in the near term. Due to this, management trimmed the adjusted EBITDA view for fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $450 million and $490 million compared with the earlier mentioned $460-$500 million. For fiscal 2023, adjusted net loss per share is envisioned between $1.52 and 97 cents compared with the loss between 66 cents and $1.19 stated earlier.Bottom LineAll said, we believe that Rite Aid looks well-positioned to drive growth in the future on the back of online strength, increased non-COVID prescriptions, continued momentum at Elixir and cost-saving initiatives.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On a positive note, amid the supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business has been in high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care.Particularly, mail-order pharmacies are registering growth on account of telehealth and remote monitoring services, creating unique opportunities for stalwarts within the industry like CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid, which invested strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications during this period.However, the majority of the retail drug store heavyweights have been southbound on the ongoing pressure of drug pricing and reimbursement. Further, with a decline in the severity of COVID-19, the demand for related retail health support has decreased meaningfully, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players.Last but not least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there has been a number of new entries in this industry, increasing the competitiveness of the space. Especially, a stalwart like Amazon's entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers.Story continuesOver the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications.According to recent reports, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots and Rite Aid are among the ""big three"" in the drugstore space. However, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores IndustryIndustry Trend Remains Dismal Amid Reimbursement Pressure: Brand-name drugs, which hold wide profit margins, are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, the low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the pandemic-induced economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials of drugs.The industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down the mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs.Threat of Amazon Entering Brick-And-Mortar: A Business Insider report on May 26, 2021 came up with the speculation that there have been discussions about Amazon setting up stand-alone stores in a few locations, including Boston and Phoenix. Further, per the report, which cites insider sources, Amazon is exploring plans to place the pharmacies inside Amazon-owned Whole Foods locations.Earlier, following its entry, the e-commerce giant grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market from the legacy retail drug store space. Needless to say, this latest speculation has come as a major blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.Online Pharmacy and Mail Order Boom: The widespread shelter-in-place regulations since the beginning of the pandemic have created a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Experts say that this transition is expected to last even after the pandemic is over. Data claims that COVID-19 has only accelerated the already-growing demand for e-pharmacy and mail-ordered home delivery systems.Going by a Patch report, ""Two years ago, 11% of U.S. adult pharmacy customers got their prescription from an online pharmacy, based on a survey conducted by market research firm CivicScience, [.] That figure has been steadily rising over the years, according to Statista.com, an online statistics portal."" With Amazon's big move into the healthcare space, the retail pharmacy industry entered a new phase of fierce competition. To counter this rivalry, the companies are strategically attempting to gain in size and scale.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term ProspectsThe industry's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

If you want to read about some more feminist stocks, go directly to 5 Best Feminist Stocks to Invest In.Gender parity initiatives at prominent companies that trade on stock markets in the United States have become all too common in the past few years. However, the impact that these initiatives are having on improving the gender pay gap is still debatable. According to data gathered by ExecuShe, a gender data company based in Sweden, women only own only about 1% of total shares in S&amp;P 500 companies, even though they account for nearly 25% of total top executives at these businesses. This is despite the fact that many of these firms, including giants like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), General Motor Company (NYSE:GM), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), have women in chief executive roles. According to Andreas Hoepner, a scientific adviser and professor of operational risk, banking, and finance at University College Dublin, this is because a lot of S&amp;P 500 firms are still run by their founders, none of whom are female. Hoepner also added that more women are in minor roles like HR Officers, which pay less than other top leadership jobs. These statistics are worrying in light of the fact that top executives at S&amp;P 500 firms were paid a median of $15.8 million in 2021. This represents an increase of more than 26% from 2020, according to a report by corporate leadership data provider Equilar. Some industries, per the report, are better at gender parity than others. These include household and personal products and pharmaceuticals. The energy and semiconductors firms, meanwhile, exhibit the largest gender disparities in the US economy. Our MethodologyThe prominent companies on the benchmark S&amp;P 500 that are led by women were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Feminist Stocks to Invest InAila Images/Shutterstock.comBest Feminist Stocks To Invest In10.

Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) progress.”  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Feminist Stocks to Invest In. Suggested Articles:12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In15 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In11 Best Income Stocks to Buy Right Now Disclosure.

We have Starbucks, Tesla, and Las Vegas Sands. Jared Blikre on set to help us break down some of these movers. All right, let's start with my pick, and that is Starbucks. Shares falling today on worry that China President Xi Jinping's tighter control is going to lead to the continuation of the COVID zero approach. The drop today, you're looking at a drop of just around 5%.Now, earlier in the day, it was the largest single drop that we have seen-- single day drop that we have seen in nearly a year. China is a critical market for Starbucks. We've heard that many times from the company. It has more than 5,700 stores in the region. Shares year to date well in the red. Investors are going to be paying very close attention to any further detail that we get on the earnings call from Starbucks next week, just in terms of their China business, what this could potentially mean for Starbucks over the coming months.And Jared, when you take a look at that year-to-date chart, you're looking at shares firmly in the red. And we know that it has been a stock that has struggled not only overseas, but of course, with the slowing economy here in the US, too.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, and I want to go to the YFi Interactive where I have the NASDAQ 100 daily heat map here. And look at all that nice green, except for the bottom. And I like how all of our picks today are basically around the same theme, which is weakness in China because of that big consolidation of power. Here's Starbucks over the last 20 years.Now, I just want to show you, it's still-- here's the good news for the bulls. Let me see if I can draw this trend line ever so haphazardly. But still, it's still, I guess, on the right side of this trend line, although we have had a very, very big decline here. But in the same vein, I do want to highlight some of the Chinese stocks that are suffering as a result of the weekend action. And notably, Tesla is going to be among them. Now, that is, of course, a US stock.]"

In fiscal 2023, Sysco envisions adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.09 to $4.39. The midpoint of this range suggests a 30% increase from the adjusted EPS in fiscal 2022. The midpoint of the guidance indicates adjusted EBITDA of about $4 billion.Story continuesCost Headwinds PersistSysco has been encountering product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit for a while now. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, U.S. Broadline saw 15.3% product cost inflation, mainly due to the poultry, fresh produce and dairy categories.In fiscal 2023, management expects inflation in the mid-single digits across all categories, which is likely to moderate from the high single digits in the first quarter to the low single digits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Sysco also expects increased operating costs in the fiscal due to transformation investments and a tough hiring landscape.Other Players Grappling With InflationMany consumer staple companies are bearing the brunt of cost inflation.For instance, Church &amp; Dwight CHD has been battling major cost hurdles. CHD expects to witness additional cost inflation of $135 million in 2022, $50 million higher than its earlier expectations.Church &amp; Dwight stated that incremental inflation is mainly associated with raw and packaging materials as well as the pass-through of similar costs from third-party manufacturers.B&amp;G Foods BGS has been battling cost inflation, which is weighing on its gross margin. On its last earnings call, management at BGS stated that it expects the input cost inflation to have a considerably industry-wide effect in the remainder of fiscal 2022.B&amp;G Foods expects to keep seeing significant cost inflation for inputs, such as ingredients, packaging, labor and transportation, due to factors like the pandemic, the Ukraine war, weather conditions, supply-chain hurdles and the shortage of labor.Flowers Foods FLO is battling major hurdles due to cost inflation and supply-chain bottlenecks. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, FLO’s materials, supplies, labor and other production costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) escalated by 240 basis points (bps) to 51.9%. This resulted from increased ingredient and packaging expenses, which led the gross margin to contract 240 bps to 48.1%.Flowers Foods expects inflation to reach its peak in the third quarter.Coming back to Sysco, the abovementioned upsides are likely to help the company battle inflationary challenges and stay on the growth path.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Adjusted EPS, which excludes these items, was $1.86.1Story continues1 Non-GAAP financial measures; see pages 3, 5, 10, 11 and 12 for explanations and reconciliations, including after-tax amounts.Quarterly Results of OperationsAg Services &amp; Oilseeds delivered substantially higher year-over-year results.Ag Services results were significantly higher than the third quarter of 2021. The short crops in South America supported U.S. exports, driving improved volumes and margins in North American origination, which had significant negative impacts from Hurricane Ida in the prior year. Better margins in global ocean freight, driven by good execution amid dynamic global trade flows, powered better results in Global Trade. South American origination saw improved volumes and margins driven by increased farmer selling in addition to higher volumes through our export facilities.Crushing results were significantly higher, with margins driven by resilient global demand for both meal and oil. Strong rapeseed margins in EMEA, driven by robust oil demand and continued market dislocations, along with positive impacts from an insurance settlement, helped drive improved results. North American soy crush margins continued to benefit from renewable diesel demand. Also, net positive timing effects in the quarter were about $175 million, as compared to the approximately $70 million in the prior-year quarter. Positive results were partially offset by lower crush volumes, including impacts from idled facilities in Ukraine and Paraguay.Refined Products and Other results were higher year over year in a strong margin environment for both refined oils and biodiesel. Robust performance in global refined oils was driven by healthy demand and elevated refined oil margins amid supply chain disruptions.Equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher versus the third quarter of 2021.Carbohydrate Solutions results were significantly higher than the prior-year quarter’s.The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much improved year-over-year results amid steady global demand for sweeteners and starches. Corn co-products — including continued robust demand for corn oil — as well as effective risk management drove higher execution margins in North America. Wheat milling had a strong performance, delivering improved volumes and margins to meet healthy demand for flour. In EMEA, the business delivered solid volumes and margins and managed through a dynamic energy environment to drive stronger results.Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially lower. Ethanol margins were pressured by lower domestic demand and elevated corn costs. In addition, the prior year’s results included contributions from the now-sold Peoria facility.Nutrition delivered revenue growth of 10%, and 16%1 on a constant currency basis; operating profit was similar to the prior-year quarter’s, and 7%1 higher on a constant currency basis, with continued strong demand offset by some demand fulfillment challenges.Human Nutrition results were higher than those of the third quarter of 2021. Strong demand for plant-based proteins, as well as solid performance in texturants, drove continued growth in Specialty Ingredients. Flavors results were impacted by adverse currency translation effects in EMEA, partially offset by continued strong demand growth in the region; demand fulfillment challenges in North America and lower demand in APAC — driven partly by lockdowns in China — also negatively impacted results. Health &amp; Wellness was lower versus the prior year, which included higher income from the Spiber fermentation agreement.Animal Nutrition results were down versus the prior-year quarter. Pet results were lower in Latin America on lower volumes, partially offset by strong volumes and margins in North America. Softer animal protein demand affected feed volumes.Other Business results were significantly higher than the prior year. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services, partially offset by increased claim settlements in captive insurance.Other Items of NoteAs additional information to help clarify underlying business performance, the table on page 10 includes reported earnings and EPS as well as adjusted earnings and EPS.Segment operating profit of $1.6 billion for the quarter includes charges of $49 million ($0.07 per share) primarily related to impairments and restructuring, and gains related to the sale of certain assets of $29 million ($0.04 per share).In Corporate results, interest expense increased year over year on higher interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs were higher year over year due primarily to performance-related compensation accruals, higher IT operating and project-related costs, and higher costs in the company’s centers of excellence. Other Corporate was favorable versus the prior year primarily due to higher results from foreign currency-related hedge activity. Corporate results also included a gain related to the mark-to-market adjustment on the Wilmar exchangeable bond of $8 million ($0.01 per share).The effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 16%, compared to approximately 18% in the prior year. The decreased rate was driven primarily by changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings, partially offset by the impact of discrete tax items.1 Constant currency revenue is ADM's GAAP revenue adjusted for the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency operating profit is ADM's GAAP operating profit adjusted for the impact of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company calculates constant currency revenue/operating profit by converting its current period revenue/operating profit using the prior period exchange rates and comparing the adjusted amount to its prior period reported results. Management believes providing constant currency revenue and constant currency operating profit provide valuable supplemental information regarding its revenue and operating profit and facilitate period-to-period comparison. Constant currency revenue and constant currency operating profit are non-GAAP measures and are not intended to replace or be alternatives to GAAP revenues and GAAP operating profit, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.Note: Additional Facts and ExplanationsAdditional facts and explanations about results and industry environment can be found at the end of the ADM Q3 Earnings Presentation at www.adm.com/webcast.Conference Call InformationADM will host a webcast on October 25, 2022, at 8 a.m. Central Time to discuss financial results and provide a company update.

The leading alcohol beverage company is likely to register year-over-year revenue and earnings growth when it reports third-quarter 2022 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AB InBev’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $15.12 billion, suggesting 6% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. For third-quarter earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at 78 cents per share, suggesting a 56% increase from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus estimate has moved down 6% in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 2.7%. Its earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.AnheuserBusch InBev SANV Price and EPS Surprise AnheuserBusch InBev SANV Price and EPS SurpriseAnheuserBusch InBev SANV price-eps-surprise | AnheuserBusch InBev SANV QuoteKey Factors to NoteAB InBev’s top line has been reflecting continued business momentum, owing to relentless execution, investment in its brands and accelerated digital transformation. The company has been benefiting from its unique commercial strategy, a strong brand portfolio and investments in operation excellence. These have been aiding market share growth across most key markets. Continued resilience in the global beer category is also expected to have aided the third-quarter performance.The company is anticipated to have retained strong business momentum in the third quarter on continued premiumization efforts and favorable industry trends. The company has been investing in a diverse portfolio of global, international, and crafts and specialty premium brands in its markets. Apart from the premium brands, BUD’s global brands lead the way in premiumization. These factors are likely to have boosted the company’s top line in the third quarter.The rapid expansion of its digital platform and leveraging technology such as B2B sales and other e-commerce platforms have been key drivers for BUD. The company has been witnessing an acceleration in the B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing trends, aiding growth for the past few months. The company’s proprietary B2B platform, BEES, is live in 18 markets and has reached 2.9 million monthly active users. These are expected to have contributed significantly to the top and bottom lines in the to-be-reported quarter.AB InBev is steadfastly growing its Beyond Beer portfolio, including products like ready-to-drink beverages like canned wine and canned cocktails, hard seltzers, cider, and flavored malt beverages. The Beyond Beer trend has recently been gaining popularity due to the rise in demand for low-alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. The company has been focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line.BUD’s revenue-management initiatives and premiumization efforts are likely to have aided revenues per hl in the third quarter. Growth in the premium portfolio and the expansion of the Beyond Beer portfolio are expected to have driven volume gains in the to-be-reported quarter.However, AB InBev’s bottom line is expected to have been marred by adverse currency translations, commodity cost inflation and higher supply-chain costs in some markets. Higher commodity costs have been mainly resulting from increased aluminum and barley prices. BUD’s presence across various countries exposes it to negative currency translations.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected higher commodity costs to continue exerting pressure on input costs. The company also anticipated volatile foreign currency.Higher cost of sales and SG&amp;A expenses are likely to have weighed on the company’s gross and operating margins. Elevated supply-chain costs have been primarily driving higher SG&amp;A expenses for the past few quarters.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for AB InBev this time around.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ADM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Archer Daniels Midland's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Archer Daniels Midland's main business drivers.Incorporated in Delaware in 1923, Archer Daniels Midland Company is successor to the Daniels Linseed Co. Founded in 1902, this Illinois-based company is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.The company processes oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa and other feedstuffs. Moreover, it engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of products like natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products as well as other specialty food and feed ingredients.Archer Daniels also has a worldwide grain elevator and transportation network for procurement, storage, cleansing and transportation of agricultural commodities. Archer Daniels also makes important investments in joint ventures to aid growth.Starting first-quarter 2018, the company realigned its business segments to reflect a new operating structure. It currently reports through the Carbohydrate Solutions, Nutrition, Oilseeds and Origination segments.On May 29, 2019, Archer Daniels created a new business unit, namely, Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds. The unit combined the company’s Origination and Oilseed operations in a single reporting structure which came into operations from Jul 1, 2019.The Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds (78.6% of 2021 total revenues) includes the Agricultural Services business, excluding Milling and engages in originating, merchandising, crushing and processing oilseeds.The Carbohydrate Solutions segment (13%) comprises the Corn and Milling operations.Nutrition segment (7.9%) includes Animal Nutrition and Bioactives businesses as well as the Wild Flavors &amp; Specialty Ingredients segment (WFSI).The Other segment (0.4%) primarily includes the company’s financial business units. However, it makes negligible contribution to the company’s revenues.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Archer Daniels Midland, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $3,144.81, or a gain of 214.48%, as of October 24, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 161.85% and gold's return of -6.50% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for ADM.Shares of Archer Daniels have outpaced the industry in a year's time on robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in second-quarter 2022. Both top and bottom lines beat estimates and grew year over year. This marked the 12th straight quarter of an earnings surprise and the 11th straight quarter of adjusted operating profit growth. Results gained from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment, driven by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remained key growth drivers. It expects the nutrition segment operating profit growth of 20% in 2022. Q3 performance is likely to be higher year over year, driven by the continued demand and favorable ethanol blending economics. However, rising SG&amp;A costs act as a deterrent. Higher inflation also remain concerning.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 9.85%, and there have been 5 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

This compares to earnings of $0.64 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3,100%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this operator of low-cost airline Volaris would post a loss of $0.43 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.42, delivering a surprise of 2.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Controladora Vuela , which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, posted revenues of $769 million for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.97%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $631 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Controladora Vuela shares have lost about 53.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.3%.What's Next for Controladora Vuela?While Controladora Vuela has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Controladora Vuela: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

LUV is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27, before market open.LUV has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 52.95%.Southwest Airlines Co. Price and EPS SurpriseSouthwest Airlines Co. Price and EPS SurpriseSouthwest Airlines Co. price-eps-surprise | Southwest Airlines Co. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for LUV this earnings season.Q3 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for LUV’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $6.23 billion, indicating 33.1% growth year over year. The top line is likely to have been aided by a solid recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues.Moreover, LUV’s bullish top-line guidance is also encouraging. For the third quarter, Southwest anticipates 9-11% total operating revenue growth from the September-end quarter of 2019. The prior-mentioned growth rate was 8-12%, which was provided during the company’s second-quarter 2022 earnings release on Jul 28.On the flip side, escalating fuel prices remain a concern. LUV expects economic fuel costs per gallon are expected to be $3.25-$3.35. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel costs per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) stands at $3.29, suggesting a 61.3% rise from the year-ago reported number.Apart from the rise in fuel costs, increases in labor and airport costs are also likely to have weighed on bottom-line growth. Due to the rise in labor and airport costs, as well as lower productivity levels, LUV expects consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 12-15% in the to-be-reported quarter from the comparable period in 2019. High capex has been a worrisome factor.Meanwhile, softness in business travel remains a concern. Managed business revenues declined roughly 26% and 32% in July and August from comparable 2019 levels. As a result, LUV now expects third-quarter 2022 managed business revenues to decline in the 26-28% band, compared with the previous 17-21% range.Story continuesNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LUV’s third-quarter 2022 earnings has been revised downward by 57.3% in the past 90 days to 41 cents per share.What Our Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Southwest Airlines this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here, as you can see below.

(NYSE:ROP) Potentially Undervalued?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roper-technologies-inc-nyse-rop-154226146.html,1666626146,STORY,['ROP'],"[Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$439 and falling to the lows of US$360. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Roper Technologies' current trading price of US$371 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Roper Technologies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Roper Technologies Is Roper Technologies Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Roper Technologies seems to be fairly priced at around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Roper Technologies today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $420.49, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Roper Technologies’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Roper Technologies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Roper Technologies' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 24%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ROP’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ROP, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

These companies are a hedge against inflation because of their ability to generate steady cash flows through rental income. In addition to this, these stocks also offer above-average dividend yields to shareholders with constant dividend streams. REITs have seen tremendous growth over the past few decades in the US and currently hold a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, according to a report by Global X. The report also mentioned that REITs make up 9% of the total commercial property market which is collectively worth over $20 trillion.REITs were badly hit during the pandemic due to construction delays and reduced operating income. However, the sector gained a foothold next year, delivering strong returns to shareholders. According to a report by Nareit, REITs returned 29% in 2021 through December 1. Another report by the same association mentioned that the FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index has outperformed the broader market in 15 of the past 25 years.Historically, REITs have performed well in periods of high inflation. This performance was attributed to rental contracts and a steady rise in construction projects. Global X referred to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which showed that REITs outperformed global equities from February 28 2005 to July 31, 2022. As mentioned above, high dividends make REITs one of the most reliable investment options. Especially in inflationary periods, their dividends are rewarding for shareholders because of high yields. Over the past 10 years ending August 31, the dividend growth in the sector has averaged 4.5%, compared with average annual inflation of 2.8%.Story continuesWith these factors in mind, we have selected some of the best REIT stocks for diverse portfolios that would help generate stable income during these times.

These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.4 Trends Deciding the Industry's FateRising Costs: Hospital companies are facing high salaries, wages and benefits, and increasing operating expenses due to inflation, which are eroding margins. Investments in growth projects will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. Even though labor shortages are expected to keep creating headaches for the industry players, the situation is expected to improve in the coming days. Also, the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Story continuesRecovering Volumes: Demand for elective procedures will likely drive patient volumes as the intensity of COVID-related headwinds keeps decreasing. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. Nonetheless, financial constraints are forcing patients to delay addressing non-emergency medical needs, as found in a survey by Discover Personal Loans, which can be a major headwind. Discover Personal Loans stated that 31% of Americans with medical debt are holding back doctor-recommended treatments.Growth in the Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare are enabling the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau’s revised report suggests that individuals aged above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers.Technological Improvements: Technological innovations, improvements and wider adoption will be a major theme in the hospital space. The trend should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and enhance the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future. The industry players are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that are utilized by hospitals. The companies are using the virtual health domain to heighten their efficiency by limiting the patients’ waiting time and trimming their treatment costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 18% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have decreased 16.1% in the past year. Given the lackluster near-term prospects, companies in the space are expected to take a hit.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; Sector The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 17.7% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 19.1% and the Zacks Medical sector’s decrease of 22.4%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 7.70X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.40X and the sector’s 7.66X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 8.75X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.74X as the charts below show.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past 5 Years)4 Stocks to Watch ForWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. HCA’s inorganic growth strategies have led to increased patient volumes, network expansion across several markets and more hospitals in its portfolio. The company has been gaining from its telemedicine business line. HCA Healthcare also focuses on boosting shareholders’ value with dividend hikes and buybacks.HCA expects current-year revenues in the band of $59.5-$61.5 billion, the mid-point of which indicates a rise of 3% from the 2021 figure. Given the current situation, profits are expected to continue increasing on the back of admissions. HCA beat earnings estimates twice in the past four quarters and missed on two occasions, the average surprise being 5%. Shares of the company have jumped 5.2% in the past month.Price &amp; Consensus: HCAAcadia Healthcare: ACHC provides behavioral healthcare services in the United States and Puerto Rico. It has been emphasizing on acquisitions for expedited growth. Buyouts added facilities, beds and hospitals to Acadia Healthcare’s network and contributed to its top line. It is also actively pursuing JVs with renowned healthcare systems, which is helping it expand its capabilities through bed additions. The year 2022 is likely to be its strongest year in terms of JVs. Its moves to streamline its portfolio to boost efficiency and profitability are also noteworthy.Acadia Healthcare expects current-year revenues in the band of $2.56-$2.60 billion, indicating an increase from the 2021 level of $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be $583-$613 million, implying an increase from $558.7 million in 2021. Adjusted earnings per share are forecast within $2.93-$3.18, calling for a rise from the 2021 level of $2.56. ACHC beat on earnings twice in the last four quarters, met the mark once and missed estimates on another occasion, the average surprise being 3.5%. Shares of ACHC have increased 0.7% in the past month.Price &amp; Consensus: ACHCUniversal Health Services: UHS focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. This segment holds immense scope for growth in the days ahead, considering the dire need to address behavioral health issues triggered by the pandemic. Universal Health’s plans to add new capacities in hospitals in important markets of Texas and California to address strong acute care demand are major positives. Earlier this year, the board of directors decided to increase its share buyback plan by $1.4 billion.Universal Health expects net revenues for 2022 within $13,235-$13,371 million, indicating an increase from $12,642.1 million a year ago. The company expects adjusted earnings per share for this year in the range of $9.60 to $10.40. UHS beat earnings estimates twice in the past four quarters and missed on the other occasions. Shares of the company have risen 0.4% in the past month.Price &amp; Consensus: UHSTenet Healthcare Corporation: THC, with its subsidiaries, provides healthcare services, primarily through general hospitals and related healthcare facilities. The company has made several buyouts, partnerships and strategic alliances to augment the scale of business, operating capacity and geographical presence. Its performance has been stimulated by USPI Holding Company’s (Ambulatory Care) operations.For the current year, THC’s net operating revenues are anticipated within $19-$19.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is still anticipated within $3,375-$3,575 million, suggesting 6% growth from the last year’s reported figure. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, the average surprise being 87.4%. Even though shares of the company have declined 2.3% in the past month, its strong fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Price &amp; Consensus: THC(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

What have we learned thus far, though, about the direction of the economy, the strength of the dollar, and the health of the consumer?Scott Krisiloff is The Transcript Editor and founder of Avondale Asset Management. Scott, good to see you. Let's start, before we dive into specific statements, thematically what have we learned thus far? What have we heard from our business leaders?SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, I think that right now business leaders are really focused, obviously, on the prospects of recession. And people are watching that very closely, looking for signs whether or not the economy is tilting into a recession.What we're seeing so far, though, is that consumer spending has held in really strongly. You're hearing from banks, especially at the beginning of the earnings season, that consumers are still spending, that consumer spending is up double digits still year-over-year. And so there's strength in the economy at the most fundamental level, which is the consumer.And yet you have deteriorating company confidence, I think among the CEOs, thinking that they need to be preparing for a recession. So at a high level, that's what we're really seeing right now.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Scott, and to that point, I want to bring up what Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon did say shortly after the earnings were released. He said, ""on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States."" Comparing that to what we've heard from other bank CEOs, other executives, how does it stack up just in terms of the likelihood that we will see a significant slowdown?Story continuesSCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, that's a great question. I think David Solomon has probably been on the more bearish end of CEOs, bank CEOs especially, for the last several quarters. I think that it's easier to find a more negative comment from David than from some of the other ones. Obviously, Jamie Dimon has been notably bearish, talking about a hurricane that could be coming through the economy.And I would say that Brian Moynihan has been on the most bullish side, at Bank of America, of any of the bank CEOs. And that has proven the same case during this earnings season as well. So Brian Moynihan was one who reminded that the consumer is still very strong, relatively. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan CEOs David Solomon and Jamie Dimon were both a little bit more bearish.And I would say that David Solomon has been the most cautious of anybody, which maybe isn't too surprising because Goldman Sachs, obviously, has the largest capital markets business of those three, whereas Bank of America would be touching consumers more directly.- Right. Right. It's not just their interpretation. Some of them certainly have different business models.So let's move over to the consumer and what we're learning from them. Here's the Amex CEO.STEPHEN SQUERI: We're confident. Look, the spending speaks for itself. You know, I mean, just look at some of these numbers. You've got goods and services up 16%. Our US consumer is up 22%. Millennial spending is up 39%. Our T&amp;E, T spending is up 57%, international spending, 37%. We haven't seen any change.And you can look at this quarter over quarter. And the reality is is that last quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending. And this is like, I don't know, $1 billion behind or something like that. But if you look at year-over-year growth, we're not seeing any changes in consumer spending behavior at all.- A remarkable statement, given inflation. Was that an outlier statement or does it really sum up what we're hearing?SCOTT KRISILOFF: No, I think it sums up, honestly, with what we're hearing from consumer credit card companies especially, which is really the most important indicator, because credit card companies are obviously seeing all of the spend that consumers are doing, not just in certain categories, and the numbers that they're seeing are significant. So you heard American Express talk about double digit increases in some major categories.And so I think what's important and why we focus on what's going on at the credit card spending company, or the companies with credit card data, is that in some of the other areas of the consumer sector, we're seeing slowdown. And you're seeing this shift from goods back to services that's still playing out post-pandemic. And the card companies are capturing all of that. But if you just listen to certain segments, you may see decline in goods spending or boosts in service spending. But the card companies are encapsulating all of that.SEANA SMITH: And Scott, another big theme, obviously, is the strong dollar. We've heard it not only this quarter but, of course, over the past several quarters. When you take a look at the dollar's jump up, nearly 17% this year alone. I want to play a quick clip from what we heard on Netflix's earnings call after the results.SPENCER NEUMANN: The FX drag is significant. We mentioned in the letter, if we look at our-- you can do the math on four quarters now. When you kind of roll it out to a full year number, we're still holding to what we're calling FX neutral to the beginning of the year, January 1 of this year, to that 19% to 20% margin range FX neutral. You'll see, m actually is in the mid to higher end of that range.But on a reported basis, it's just a little over 17%. So there's about 2 and 1/2 points of drag in our margin. That equates to about $1 billion of revenue drag about $800 million of margin drag.SEANA SMITH: That was Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann. And Scott, we've heard it from a number of executives, IBM, one of the big companies, obviously out warning about their strong dollar, their CFO saying it's a big wild card to what's going to happen to the US dollar, obviously having a huge impact on their business.I'm sure we'll hear it more this week when we hear from some of the larger tech giants. What's on your radar as we look out over the next couple of weeks, when it comes to the strong dollar?SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, I mean, I think the strong dollar is one component, one major component that's impacting earnings growth in this quarter. And I think that's one of the big things that we're seeing this quarter versus previous quarters is that you're really starting to see earnings growth get impacted by some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in the economy.So the dollar is one, and Netflix pointed it out there. Procter &amp; Gamble also talked about a 9 point headwind just from currency in its most recent quarter. But then also, Procter &amp; Gamble talked about a 27 point overall earnings growth headwind, which again, 27 points is a massive number in terms of the growth headwind. And that was not just in terms of strong dollar but that was also just the general inflationary environment, both in terms of their input costs, and then also their freight and delivery costs.And so those things, what we've been talking about thematically in markets and capital markets for a long time, I think are starting to actually hit the financial statements of companies in this quarter. And that's really important for two reasons. Not only is it's impacting and showing where the economy is going, but as we think about what multiples to give to stocks, to equities, and ability to repay debt for companies as well, capital markets can get impacted a further leg here by decreasing earnings and some of these dynamics finally flowing through.- All right. That's great stuff. The Transcript Editor and Avondale Asset Management founder, Scott Krisiloff. Appreciate it, man. Thanks.]"

109,43b16771-27ed-37ff-b7a9-8601d5035d1c,GPN,2022-10-25,Global Payments (GPN) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-payments-gpn-earnings-expected-140002699.html,1666620002,STORY,"['GPN', 'BFH']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Global Payments (GPN) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electronics payment processing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.2%.Revenues are expected to be $2.07 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Global Payments?For Global Payments, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.48%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Global Payments will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Global Payments would post earnings of $2.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.36, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Global Payments doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, Bread Financial Holdings (BFH), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.69 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -39.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $967.64 million, down 12% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Bread Financial has been revised 87% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.21%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bread Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 44% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $50.54 in the previous session. Schlumberger has gained 68.3% since the start of the year compared to the 36.8% move for the Zacks Oils-Energy sector and the 6.6% return for the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 21, 2022, Schlumberger reported EPS of $0.63 versus consensus estimate of $0.55.For the current fiscal year, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $2.03 per share on $27.36 billion in revenues. This represents a 58.59% change in EPS on a 19.32% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.83 per share on $31.52 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 39.41% and 15.19%, respectively.Valuation MetricsSchlumberger may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Schlumberger has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 24.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 24.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 17.9X versus its peer group's average of 15.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.58. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Schlumberger currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Schlumberger fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Schlumberger shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does SLB Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of SLB have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Liberty Energy Inc. (LBRT). LBRT has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of A.Earnings were strong last quarter. Liberty Energy Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 23.81%, and for the current fiscal year, LBRT is expected to post earnings of $2.87 per share on revenue of $3.84 billion.Shares of Liberty Energy Inc. have gained 36.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 8.65X and a P/CF of 33.71X.The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry is in the top 7% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for SLB and LBRT, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(PKG) Q3 Earnings Meet Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/packaging-corp-pkg-q3-earnings-220510086.html,1666649110,STORY,['PKG'],"[Packaging Corp. (PKG) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.83 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of $2.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of containerboard and corrugated packaging products would post earnings of $2.87 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.23, delivering a surprise of 12.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Packaging Corp. , which belongs to the Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry, posted revenues of $2.13 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.73%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Packaging Corp. Shares have lost about 14.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.3%.What's Next for Packaging Corp.While Packaging Corp. Has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Packaging Corp. Unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.60 on $2.18 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.39 on $8.77 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Containers - Paper and Packaging is currently in the bottom 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Sonoco (SON), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 31.This packaging maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +57.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Sonoco's revenues are expected to be $1.92 billion, up 35.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Third quarter net sales were $2.1 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2021.Diluted earnings per share attributable to Packaging Corporation of America shareholdersThree Months EndedSeptember 3020222021ChangeReported Diluted EPS$2.80$2.63$0.17Special Items Expense (1)0.030.06(0.03)Diluted EPS excluding Special items$2.83$2.69$0.14(1) For descriptions and amounts of our special items, see the schedules with this release.Reported earnings in the third quarter of 2022 include special items primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, AL mill for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities.Excluding special items, the $.14 per share increase in third quarter 2022 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix in our Packaging $1.60 and Paper $.23 segments, lower interest expense $.04, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases $.04, and a lower tax rate $.02. These items were partially offset by higher operating costs ($.77), lower volume in our Packaging ($.52) and Paper ($.05) segments, higher freight and logistics expenses ($.20), higher scheduled outage expenses ($.10), higher depreciation expense ($.07), higher converting costs ($.04), and other expenses ($.04).Results were $.03 above third quarter guidance of $2.80 per share primarily due to higher prices and mix in our Packaging and Paper segments and lower operating costs.Financial information by segment is summarized below and in the schedules with this release.(dollars in millions)Three Months EndedSeptember 3020222021Segment income (loss)Packaging$359.2$365.2Paper26.111.0Corporate and Other(25.0)(23.4)$360.3$352.8Segment income (loss) excluding special itemsPackaging$362.0$371.1Paper27.412.2Corporate and Other(25.0)(23.3)$364.4$360.0EBITDA excluding special itemsPackaging$467.1$466.9Paper32.618.1Corporate and Other(22.6)(21.0)$477.1$464.0In the Packaging segment, total corrugated products shipments and shipments per day were down (6.0%) over last year’s third quarter. Containerboard production was 1,116,000 tons, and containerboard inventory was up 11,000 tons from the third quarter of 2021 and up 22,000 tons compared to the second quarter of 2022. In the Paper segment, sales volume was down 13,000 tons compared to the third quarter of 2021, and up 6,000 tons compared to the second quarter of 2022.Story continuesCommenting on reported results, Mark W. Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO, said, ""We were able to exceed our guidance for the quarter even though we continued to experience significant cost inflation across the Company and demand in our Packaging segment was well below our expectations. Implementation of our previously announced price increases in the Packaging and Paper segments continued to generate excellent results, and our mills and plants remained focused on lowering operating costs through process efficiency optimization efforts and material usage initiatives. We also ran our containerboard system in a very cost-effective manner to match our supply with demand, and the scheduled outages in our mills were executed very well.""""Looking ahead as we move from the third and into the fourth quarter,"" Mr. Kowlzan added, ""we see most of the issues that impacted third quarter Packaging segment demand continuing, and we will run our containerboard system based on this current outlook. At our Jackson, Alabama mill we will be completing the scheduled annual maintenance outage as well as the first phase of the containerboard conversion work on the No. 3 machine. Our box plants will have four less shipping days in the fourth quarter, and we also expect a seasonally less rich mix in corrugated products as well as lower average export containerboard prices. In our Paper segment, we will continue to implement our price increase that took effect in September; however, volume will be lower compared to the seasonally stronger third quarter. Scheduled outage expenses will be higher, and we expect slightly higher operating costs, primarily labor and benefit expenses, along with anticipated colder weather resulting in higher energy costs. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $2.22 per share.""We present various non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including diluted EPS excluding special items, segment income excluding special items and EBITDA excluding special items. We provide information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with GAAP in the schedules to this press release. We present our earnings expectation for the upcoming quarter excluding special items as special items are difficult to predict and quantify and may reflect the effect of future events. We currently anticipate special items in the fourth quarter of 2022 to include charges, fees, and expenses for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities at the Jackson, AL mill. We do not currently expect any additional significant special items during the fourth quarter; however, additional special items may arise due to fourth quarter events.PCA is the third largest producer of containerboard products and a leading producer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. PCA operates eight mills and 90 corrugated products plants and related facilities.Some of the statements in this press release are forward-looking statements.

If you want to read about some more feminist stocks, go directly to 5 Best Feminist Stocks to Invest In.Gender parity initiatives at prominent companies that trade on stock markets in the United States have become all too common in the past few years. However, the impact that these initiatives are having on improving the gender pay gap is still debatable. According to data gathered by ExecuShe, a gender data company based in Sweden, women only own only about 1% of total shares in S&amp;P 500 companies, even though they account for nearly 25% of total top executives at these businesses. This is despite the fact that many of these firms, including giants like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), General Motor Company (NYSE:GM), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), have women in chief executive roles. According to Andreas Hoepner, a scientific adviser and professor of operational risk, banking, and finance at University College Dublin, this is because a lot of S&amp;P 500 firms are still run by their founders, none of whom are female. Hoepner also added that more women are in minor roles like HR Officers, which pay less than other top leadership jobs. These statistics are worrying in light of the fact that top executives at S&amp;P 500 firms were paid a median of $15.8 million in 2021. This represents an increase of more than 26% from 2020, according to a report by corporate leadership data provider Equilar. Some industries, per the report, are better at gender parity than others. These include household and personal products and pharmaceuticals. The energy and semiconductors firms, meanwhile, exhibit the largest gender disparities in the US economy. Our MethodologyThe prominent companies on the benchmark S&amp;P 500 that are led by women were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed.

Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) progress.”  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Feminist Stocks to Invest In. Suggested Articles:12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In15 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In11 Best Income Stocks to Buy Right Now Disclosure.

For more tech stock declines, go to 5 Biggest Tech Stock Drops in 2022. If there is one thing that can be said with certainty about the stock market right now, it's that the market is officially in bear mode. This means that all major stock indexes, and shares, have now entered a protracted period of share price drops. These drops have been caused by the macroeconomic environment, and they are the result of several factors. One factor is inflation, as rising prices have hit consumer purchasing power and forced them to concentrate most of their spending resources on essential items. For large companies, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), this means that the money consumers might have allocated for a smartphone or a personal computing purchase is simply not there.The other is the drastic increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which is estimated to hike the rate to 5% by May next year, according to the traders betting on the futures market. The current rate sits at 3.25% and the new bets suggest that at least one massive 75 basis point and two 50 basis point hikes are headed our way.Taking stock of the current situation for major stock indexes reveals that the picture is far from pretty. For instance, the NASDAQ Composite Index is down by 31% year to date, the S&amp;P 500 index is down by 22%, the DOW Jones Industrial Average by 15%, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by 18%.In this article we will focus on major tech stocks that fell sharply this year. Among the notable stocks in our list are Peloton Interactive, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), and Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT).Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology We studied hundreds of stocks in the technology market to narrow down to those that have witnessed the largest share price losses.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) (+34.6%): After a punishing first half of the year when bearish investors came to believe that Netflix’s growth days were done for good, the company reported fewer subscriber losses than expected in the second quarter and guided for a return to at least modest subscriber growth in the third quarter. In addition, as more information about the company’s planned advertising supported subscription tier has become available, investors began to express growing confidence in this tool to revitalize growth in 2023.”13.

(NASDAQ:META) is down roughly 60%, and Carmax, Eurofins Scientific, Coherent and Ciena have lost about half their value. I’m wearing a dunce cap for Meta, as the changes Apple made to privacy tracking severely impacted Meta’s effectiveness at targeting ads to the right consumers. However, despite being compared recently to AOL by one analyst, Meta continues to capture enormous amounts of consumer attention: roughly 2.9 billion people use one of its sites every day. I believe it has a very long runway on monetizing those eyeballs, especially outside North America. For all its problems with ad tracking, and despite heavy investment in the so called metaverse, Meta should earn about $10 per share in 2022 and more next year. The stock, at $136 on September 30, reflects pessimism that Meta will ever recover. We’re holding because we think that Meta has the resources to improve its advertising efficiency, and that it eventually will.”6. Confluent, Inc.

What have we learned thus far, though, about the direction of the economy, the strength of the dollar, and the health of the consumer?Scott Krisiloff is The Transcript Editor and founder of Avondale Asset Management. Scott, good to see you. Let's start, before we dive into specific statements, thematically what have we learned thus far? What have we heard from our business leaders?SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, I think that right now business leaders are really focused, obviously, on the prospects of recession. And people are watching that very closely, looking for signs whether or not the economy is tilting into a recession.What we're seeing so far, though, is that consumer spending has held in really strongly. You're hearing from banks, especially at the beginning of the earnings season, that consumers are still spending, that consumer spending is up double digits still year-over-year. And so there's strength in the economy at the most fundamental level, which is the consumer.And yet you have deteriorating company confidence, I think among the CEOs, thinking that they need to be preparing for a recession. So at a high level, that's what we're really seeing right now.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Scott, and to that point, I want to bring up what Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon did say shortly after the earnings were released. He said, ""on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States."" Comparing that to what we've heard from other bank CEOs, other executives, how does it stack up just in terms of the likelihood that we will see a significant slowdown?Story continuesSCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, that's a great question. I think David Solomon has probably been on the more bearish end of CEOs, bank CEOs especially, for the last several quarters. I think that it's easier to find a more negative comment from David than from some of the other ones. Obviously, Jamie Dimon has been notably bearish, talking about a hurricane that could be coming through the economy.And I would say that Brian Moynihan has been on the most bullish side, at Bank of America, of any of the bank CEOs. And that has proven the same case during this earnings season as well. So Brian Moynihan was one who reminded that the consumer is still very strong, relatively. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan CEOs David Solomon and Jamie Dimon were both a little bit more bearish.And I would say that David Solomon has been the most cautious of anybody, which maybe isn't too surprising because Goldman Sachs, obviously, has the largest capital markets business of those three, whereas Bank of America would be touching consumers more directly.- Right. Right. It's not just their interpretation. Some of them certainly have different business models.So let's move over to the consumer and what we're learning from them. Here's the Amex CEO.STEPHEN SQUERI: We're confident. Look, the spending speaks for itself. You know, I mean, just look at some of these numbers. You've got goods and services up 16%. Our US consumer is up 22%. Millennial spending is up 39%. Our T&amp;E, T spending is up 57%, international spending, 37%. We haven't seen any change.And you can look at this quarter over quarter. And the reality is is that last quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending. And this is like, I don't know, $1 billion behind or something like that. But if you look at year-over-year growth, we're not seeing any changes in consumer spending behavior at all.- A remarkable statement, given inflation. Was that an outlier statement or does it really sum up what we're hearing?SCOTT KRISILOFF: No, I think it sums up, honestly, with what we're hearing from consumer credit card companies especially, which is really the most important indicator, because credit card companies are obviously seeing all of the spend that consumers are doing, not just in certain categories, and the numbers that they're seeing are significant. So you heard American Express talk about double digit increases in some major categories.And so I think what's important and why we focus on what's going on at the credit card spending company, or the companies with credit card data, is that in some of the other areas of the consumer sector, we're seeing slowdown. And you're seeing this shift from goods back to services that's still playing out post-pandemic. And the card companies are capturing all of that. But if you just listen to certain segments, you may see decline in goods spending or boosts in service spending. But the card companies are encapsulating all of that.SEANA SMITH: And Scott, another big theme, obviously, is the strong dollar. We've heard it not only this quarter but, of course, over the past several quarters. When you take a look at the dollar's jump up, nearly 17% this year alone. I want to play a quick clip from what we heard on Netflix's earnings call after the results.SPENCER NEUMANN: The FX drag is significant. We mentioned in the letter, if we look at our-- you can do the math on four quarters now. When you kind of roll it out to a full year number, we're still holding to what we're calling FX neutral to the beginning of the year, January 1 of this year, to that 19% to 20% margin range FX neutral. You'll see, m actually is in the mid to higher end of that range.But on a reported basis, it's just a little over 17%. So there's about 2 and 1/2 points of drag in our margin. That equates to about $1 billion of revenue drag about $800 million of margin drag.SEANA SMITH: That was Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann. And Scott, we've heard it from a number of executives, IBM, one of the big companies, obviously out warning about their strong dollar, their CFO saying it's a big wild card to what's going to happen to the US dollar, obviously having a huge impact on their business.I'm sure we'll hear it more this week when we hear from some of the larger tech giants. What's on your radar as we look out over the next couple of weeks, when it comes to the strong dollar?SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, I mean, I think the strong dollar is one component, one major component that's impacting earnings growth in this quarter. And I think that's one of the big things that we're seeing this quarter versus previous quarters is that you're really starting to see earnings growth get impacted by some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in the economy.So the dollar is one, and Netflix pointed it out there. Procter &amp; Gamble also talked about a 9 point headwind just from currency in its most recent quarter. But then also, Procter &amp; Gamble talked about a 27 point overall earnings growth headwind, which again, 27 points is a massive number in terms of the growth headwind. And that was not just in terms of strong dollar but that was also just the general inflationary environment, both in terms of their input costs, and then also their freight and delivery costs.And so those things, what we've been talking about thematically in markets and capital markets for a long time, I think are starting to actually hit the financial statements of companies in this quarter. And that's really important for two reasons. Not only is it's impacting and showing where the economy is going, but as we think about what multiples to give to stocks, to equities, and ability to repay debt for companies as well, capital markets can get impacted a further leg here by decreasing earnings and some of these dynamics finally flowing through.- All right. That's great stuff. The Transcript Editor and Avondale Asset Management founder, Scott Krisiloff. Appreciate it, man. Thanks.]"

(NASDAQ:AMGN) sold US$4.9m worth of stock, a potential red flag that needs to be monitored",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-120058139.html,1666699258,STORY,['AMGN'],"[While it’s been a great week for Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) shareholders after stock gained 3.3%, they should consider it with a grain of salt. The fact that insiders chose to dispose of US$4.9m worth of stock in the past 12 months even though prices were relatively low could be indicative of some anticipated weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$242 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$261. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 40% of Jonathan Graham's holding.Insiders in Amgen didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Amgen Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Amgen shares. Specifically, Lead Independent Director Robert Eckert ditched US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Amgen insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$219m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Amgen Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Amgen stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Amgen makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Amgen.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this gold and copper miner have returned +2.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.8% change. The Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, to which Newmont belongs, has gained 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.29 per share, indicating a change of -51.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.11 points to a change of -28.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -19.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.39 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -11.5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Newmont.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Newmont, the consensus sales estimate of $2.79 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -3.6%. The $12.07 billion and $12.26 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +1.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $3.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.2%. EPS of $0.46 for the same period compares with $0.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.5%. The EPS surprise was -23.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

138,28345c7d-ed40-33f0-94fe-bbbfc38038c0,NEM,2022-10-25,4 High-Yield Dividend Stocks for Retirees Fighting Raging Inflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-high-yield-dividend-stocks-162433556.html,1666369473,STORY,"['CVX', 'PFE', 'NEM', 'RIO']","[Current times are among the most challenging for creating a retirement portfolio or ensuring that retirees get positive returns (adjusted for inflation). Even with aggressive contractionary monetary policies, inflation has remained stubbornly high in the United States. In the current scenario, individuals will witness erosion of purchasing power by investing in risk-free assets.It’s essential to invest in stocks. However, it would be equally suicidal to go significantly overweight on high-beta stocks or growth stocks. A good idea is to invest in high-yield dividend stocks for retirees.Even amidst challenging macro-economic conditions, there is some good news for investors. High-yield dividend stocks for retirees are also trading at attractive valuations. Besides regular cash flows, I expect capital gains from these high-yield dividend stocks. This will help in beating inflation and increasing the purchasing power of a retirement portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss four high-yield dividend stocks for retirees that trades at an attractive valuation.RIORio Tinto$54.84CVXChevron$172.42NEMNewmont Corporation$42.10PFEPfizer$44.83Rio Tinto (RIO)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockAs a diversified industrial commodities company, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is worth grabbing at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.03. It’s also among the high-yield dividend stocks for retirees with a robust yield of 12.47%.Since the focus is on dividends, it’s worth noting that Rio reported free cash flow of $7.1 billion for the first half of 2022. Dividends are therefore sustainable. Further, Rio has a strong balance sheet with a positive net cash position of $300 million. There is ample flexibility to invest in growth projects. I also like the fact that Rio is diversifying into industrial commodities that are likely to see robust demand. As an example, the company is likely to be the “largest source of lithium supply in Europe for at least the next 15 years.” With surging demand for lithium on the back of EV adoption, Rio is positioned to benefit.Story continuesChevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comThe energy sector has also presented some attractive investment opportunities. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock is my pick with a current dividend yield of 3.29%. I believe that CVX stock is positioned for sustained dividend growth if oil trades above $80 in the coming years.To underscore my view, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $13.3 billion for Q2 2022. The annual cash flow potential is therefore $40 billion. Strong cash flows are on the back of high oil price and low break-even oil assets.Chevron expects to invest $15 to $17 billion annually in the next few years. Even after these investments, the company’s free cash flow is likely to be in excess of $15 billion. This would provide ample headroom for dividend growth and aggressive share repurchase. The company has already guided for annual buyback in the range of $5 to $15 billion.It’s also worth mentioning that CVX stock has surged by 49% in the last 12 months. If oil remains well above $80 per barrel, the stock is likely to trend higher for this investment grade balance sheet company.Newmont Corporation (NEM)An image of multiple gold barsSource: ShutterstockGold has been depressed with aggressive contractionary policies translating into a stronger dollar. However, with factors of inflation, geopolitical tensions, ballooning of global debt and economic uncertainty, I would bet on a strong reversal for gold.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a high-quality pick from the gold mining sector. After a correction of 32% for year-to-date 2022, NEM stock looks undervalued. The stock also offers a robust dividend yield of 5.21%.Specific to Newmont, the company has an investment grade balance sheet with net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA of 0.3. Further, Newmont has a robust liquidity buffer of $7.3 billion. A healthy credit profile will ensure that dividends sustain. Also, if gold is back to $2,000 an ounce, there is visibility for dividend growth. Newmont also has a strong asset base with 96 million ounces of gold reserves in addition to 114 million ounces in resources. The company expects to sustain production into 2040s. Once sentiments reverse for gold, cash flows will swell.Pfizer (PFE)Source: ShutterstockPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is also among the top high-yield dividend stocks for retirees. The current dividend yield of 3.58% is attractive and PFE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.68. The downside seems capped while the upside can be meaningful.It’s worth noting that Pfizer reported $29.9 billion in free cash flow for 2021. This was on the back of covid-19 vaccine sales. FCF is likely to remain robust even for the current year.The key point is that Pfizer has strong financial flexibility to invest in the deep pipeline of drug candidates. For the year, Pfizer expects to invest $12 billion in research and development.With several late-stage drug candidates, the company has revenue growth visibility. Pfizer has also been active on the acquisition front in the last few quarters. This has helped in boosting the product pipeline.In the last 10 years, Pfizer has increased dividends at a CAGR of 6.9%. Considering the acquisitions and drug pipeline, I expect further growth in dividends. Also, at current valuations, there is scope for robust capital gains.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

139,c6b562d6-ce6f-36eb-9daf-cd1a63862a04,PEG,2022-10-25,Analysts Estimate PSEG (PEG) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-pseg-peg-report-140002329.html,1666620002,STORY,"['PEG', 'PCGU']","[The market expects PSEG (PEG) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. Is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.4%.Revenues are expected to be $2.23 billion, up 17.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.92% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PSEG?For PSEG, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PSEG will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PSEG would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of -1.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PSEG doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, PG&amp;E (PCG) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.24 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.92 billion, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for PG&amp;E has been revised 5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.17%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&amp;E will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every time the market has tried to bounce, some fresh news has come out, triggering another selloff. With inflation still running hot and the Federal Reserve set for more rate hikes, investors need to be cautious. That said, with the market down this far, there are some great bargains out there. But they aren’t all created equal. In fact, some names that look very cheap are actually stocks to sell.These seven stocks to sell, in particular, are attracting a lot of attention among traders. With high daily volume and the subject of much discussion on social media, these stocks might seem set for a comeback. But, as you’ll see, each of them comes with major drawbacks. As a result, when you’re bargain hunting, don’t buy these names.PLTRPalantir$8.03CCLCarnival$8.10COINCoinbase$63.51TLRYTilray$3.29FUBOFuboTV$3.74MMacy’s$18.50DNAGinkgo Bioworks$2.47InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPalantir (PLTR)A close-up shot of a hand on a screen with the Palantir (PLTR) logo.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) has been shrouded in mystery for some time. The artificial intelligence and security software firm has been in business since 2003. It has extensive ties to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other national defense agencies. Investors have assumed that its proximity to key power centers would eventually lead to major profits for Palantir.However, it’s worth questioning when this is going to happen. Palantir will turn 20 years old next year. It’s hardly a young start-up anymore. The company was expected to be one of the top tech unicorns in the 2010s. But it finally limped to market with a poorly received direct stock offering in 2020, as Palantir wasn’t able to convert the buzz into real profits.PLTR stock surged from $10 to $35 after its direct listing as it got caught up in the meme-stock mania of early 2021. Palantir had a great pitch for the times with its ties to key government agencies and rumors about its big new contracts and deals. As meme stock-mania faded, however, Palantir has fallen below $10 per share.Story continuesHowever, the company still has a market capitalization of more than $15 billion. That equates to a still-high valuation of eight times revenue for a firm that is barely breaking even and whose sales are only growing at around 20% per year. It’s time to stop giving Palantir excuses. Its business has been around long enough that it should have more results than this to justify all the hype.Carnival Corp (CCL)Carnival (CCL) cruise ship on water in front of beach with chairsSource: FlickrCarnival Corp (NYSE:CCL) is one of the three big publicly traded cruise lines. Investors have gravitated to these stocks as a way of playing the great economic and tourism reopening after the pandemic.That idea made sense for a time. It was plausible that cruise lines would recover along with hotels, restaurants, airlines, and so on. However, fast forward to late 2022, and the thesis no longer holds water.The cruise lines have repeatedly missed analysts’ average estimates as their revenue and bookings have come up short of expectations. Meanwhile, inflation is wreaking havoc on the supply side of the equation. The prices of labor, fuel, and food have all surged, making it more expensive than ever for the companies to do business.CCL stock surged this week on hopes related to its new bond offering. It’s true that Carnival is unlikely to go bankrupt anytime soon. However, it faces a heavy debt load and serious dilution from all the shares that it issued to stay afloat during the pandemic. Long story short, Carnival isn’t going out of business, but its shares won’t return to their pre-pandemic levels anytime soon either.Coinbase Global (COIN)Silver Litecoin coin facing forward on a pile of litecoinsSource: ShutterstockCoinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of America’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Last year, that seemed like quite a good business to be in. The price of leading cryptocurrencies were surging, and there was a great deal of excitement about crypto, as celebrities like Matt Damon were promoting it to consumers.Now, however, crypto is in trouble. Bankruptcies of crypto firms and failing stablecoins have become the new normal. Even the strongest cryptos have slumped amid a bear market for technology in general and blockchain in particular.Some traders are drawn to COIN stock because of its past earnings. The company earned $17 per share in 2021, which would imply a P/E ratio of four.That seems great. But the problem is that Coinbase’s earnings are inextricably tied to the price of cryptos because Coinbase charges fees based on a percentage of the value of transactions. When crypto prices slump, so does Coinbase’s earnings.Now, in fact, Coinbase is expected to lose more than $6 per share in 2022. Analysts, on average, expect the company to lose money in 2023 and 2024. In other words,  a big comeback for COIN stock  won’t occur unless and until the cryptocurrency market comes back to life.Tilray Brands (TLRY)Tilray (TLRY) logo on a web browser.Source: Jarretera / Shutterstock.comThe Biden administration recently announced an executive order regarding cannabis. President Joe Biden is pardoning everyone convicted by the federal judiciary for marijuana possession. Additionally, he has ordered the government to look into changing the status of marijuana as an illegal drug as far as federal regulators are concerned. That action could reduce the severity of the government’s restrictions of cannabis and the punishments for its use.But such a move by Biden would not  legalize cannabis. While it would be a step in the right direction for the cannabis industry, it would be more of a gesture than a tangible development. Right now, American cannabis producers are held back by two main factors: High taxation and a lack of access to traditional banking channels. This Biden administration’s move won’t help solve either problem.Canadian marijuana firm Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) popped more than 30% on the announcement, though it has subsequently given back much of those gains.But there was little reason for Tilray to rally at all. Tilray is primarily involved in the Canadian market, so federal legalization in the United States — which, to reiterate, hasn’t happened yet — wouldn’t change the game for Tilray. Importantly, the firm continues to report operating losses, limited revenue growth, and has only modest exposure to the U.S. market. In other words, don’t buy TLRY stock as a  play on potential U.S. marijuana legalization.FuboTV (FUBO)FuboTV (FUBO) logo on iPhone displaySource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.comFuboTV (NYSE:FUBO) was supposed to revolutionize sports television. Many FUBO bulls also believed that  FuboTV would also become a major player in the sports betting market as well. However, little of the company’s original vision has come to pass, and the shares are off by around 90% from their highs.Some traders might be drawn to Fubo because 26% of its shares are being sold short, creating the potential for a short squeeze. A squeeze could lead to a short-term jump by the stock price. Over the longer term, however, there’s very little evidence that FuboTV’s business model works. That’s why it’s on this list of stocks to sell.FuboTV is simply spending so much on content that its subscriber revenues aren’t covering its costs. Buying the rights to live sporting events rights, after all, is expensive.The company recently announced its preliminary Q3 results, including an adjusted EBITDA loss of around $100 million. That simply isn’t going to cut it. With the company’s cash balance being around $300 million, it could run out of funds by this time next year. On top of that, FuboTV is shuttering its sports betting operations. FuboTV may have an engaging product, but without a better business model, FUBO stock will keep on sliding.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comThe shares of mall retailer Macy’s (NYSE:M) have rallied off their lows in recent weeks. Traders are looking at M stock as a potential bargain because the shares are trading at around five times the analysts’ average estimate of the company’s earnings.The issue, however, is that its earnings may come in below the mean outlook. Macy’s and other department stores had a great 2021 as consumers spent at a record pace. But given high inflation, high gas prices, and souring employment prospects, consumers may be more thrifty this holiday season. Meanwhile, higher labor and product costs will put pressure on Macy’s profit margins.The company is also spending heavily on its share buyback program. That could pay off in a big way if the company can maintain its current profitability. As we saw with the decline of Sears and JC Penney, however, old-school retailers can easily fail if anything goes wrong.Macy’s may wish it kept that cash on its balance sheet instead of spending it on buybacks. Macy’s may work out, but it’s a risky bet that is far less of a sure thing than its low P/E ratio might suggest.Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA)Person holding mobile phone with logo of American biotechnology company Ginkgo Bioworks Inc. on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. DNA stockSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comGinkgo Bioworks (NYSE:DNA) is a synthetic biology company. In English, that means it uses genetic engineering to design organisms which can be utilized for industrial purposes. The company has something of a novel business model, since it designs these genetic compounds and then attempts to sell them to customers across a variety of industries.This technology has tremendous potential. But hype, along with Cathie Wood’s position in the company, helped lift Gingko to a market capitalization of $20 billion at one point. However, short sellers hit the company with a blistering report suggesting that its technology is far from being commercialized and that many of its deals appear to be made by entities with which it had prior financial relationships. In other words, the technology may not be as wonderful as many believe.Despite its $2.50 stock price today, Ginkgo still has a market cap of more than $4 billion. That’s an awfully big price tag for a company with around $400 million of annual revenue which is generating large operating losses.To make matters worse, analysts’ average estimate calls for the company’s revenues to shrink slightly in 2023. so this is an unprofitable firm that isn’t even growing and hasn’t yet validated its business model.Its technology may eventually enable it to achieve great things. But in this current bear market,  more than future possibilities are needed to boost a stock. Ginkgo is a sell; it’s just too risky given current macroeconomic conditions.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It hit its highest since August 2011 on Friday at 2.532% before the Wall Street Journal report on the Fed.The two-year yield, which is most sensitive to interest rate expectations, fell 4 bps to 1.97%. Yields move inversely to prices.U.S. borrowing costs, falling after dismal data on home prices, added further downside pressure to euro area's yields.The 10-year Treasury yield was down 16 bps to 4.08%.The ECB is widely expected to raise rates by 75 bps for the second consecutive meeting on Thursday, taking the deposit rate to 1.5%. Economists polled by Reuters said they expected the rate to peak at 2.5% next year, its highest level since 2008.However, some investors believe a weakening economy and lower energy prices will mean the ECB's peak rate ends at a lower point than that.German Ifo survey data released on Tuesday showed that business sentiment was better than expected but still slipped to a two-year low this month. Separate survey data from Monday showed that euro zone business activity contracted at the fastest pace in nearly two years in October.Story continuesItaly's 10-year yield fell 22 bps on Tuesday to 4.371%, its lowest since Oct. 6.The closely watched gap between Germany and Italy's 10-year yields narrowed to 219 bps, near its lowest since the end of September.A slowing economy, warmer weather and efforts to fill storage facilities have helped pull down European energy prices sharply in recent weeks.

But those coronavirus curbs, which have hit industries and households, could be lifted in coming months.That sets up a potential tug-of-war for supplies between a revived China, leaving little room to negotiate prices — and that could send natural gas prices higher, after falling over 70% since August.But with President Xi Jingping consolidating his power in the Communist Party, investors are growing worried on whether China's economy can bounce back. He unceremoniously ejected his business-friendly predecessor Hu Jintao from proceedings at the weekend, prompting fears that politics will replace economic growth as a high priority.And there are signs Beijing might not hit its economic goal for the year. Its GDP rose 3.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, beating expectations for 3.2%. Even so, the print is seen as undershooting what the Chinese government needs to reach its GDP target of 5.5% growth this year.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is NRG Energy (NRG). NRG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 8.57, which compares to its industry's average of 13.07. Over the past year, NRG's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.06 and as low as 4.45, with a median of 6.54.We also note that NRG holds a PEG ratio of 0.68. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NRG's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.82. NRG's PEG has been as high as 1.24 and as low as 0.12, with a median of 0.55, all within the past year.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is NRG's P/B ratio of 1.81. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.99. NRG's P/B has been as high as 2.93 and as low as 1.59, with a median of 2.13, over the past year.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Utility - Electric Power value stock, take a look at RWE AG (RWEOY). RWEOY is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.RWE AG is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 8.77 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 6.05. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 13.07 and average PEG ratio of 1.82.RWEOY's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 20.53 and as low as 8.77, with a median of 17.77, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 6.29 and as low as 2.45, with a median of 3.79, all within the past year.Furthermore, RWE AG holds a P/B ratio of 2.46 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 1.99. RWEOY's P/B has been as high as 2.96, as low as 1.14, with a median of 2.18 over the past 12 months.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that NRG Energy and RWE AG are likely undervalued currently.

On the contrary, net sales increased 8% year over year but marginally lagged the consensus mark.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Masco’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.07 per share, suggesting a rise of 8.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of 99 cents. The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $2.26 billion, indicating a 2.7% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Masco Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMasco Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMasco Corporation price-eps-surprise | Masco Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteMasco is likely to have generated tepid earnings and revenues in third-quarter 2022. Slowness in the housing and repair, and remodel markets is likely to have ailed MAS’ top-line performance. The bottom line is expected to have been dented by intense inflationary pressure, particularly on commodities and logistics, and supply-chain issues in the quarter to be reported. Also, inflation is likely to have increased for raw material, freight and labor.Apart from the above-mentioned costs, MAS persistently incurs expenses related to product launches and acquisitions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products’ sales of $1,345 million indicates a 1.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The same for the Decorative Architectural Products segment’s sales is currently pegged at $920 million, calling for a 5.1% increase from the year-earlier quarter’s reported number.The consensus mark for Plumbing Products’ non-GAAP operating profit is pegged at $243 million, suggesting 2% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The same for Decorative Architectural Products’ non-GAAP operating profit is pegged at $160 million, implying a 3.6% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Masco this time around.

The new report, ""Women CEOs: Leadership for a Diverse Future,"" found that women CEOs more frequently use terms associated with positive communication and more often articulate concepts of diversity, empathy, adaptability and transformation.This study suggests there is a transformation among women's leadership styles: today's women CEOs are more aligned with the concept of authentic leadership, which draws from and mirrors the diversity of society. Women's leadership styles also tend to benefit a broader range of stakeholders within and outside companies.""Women CEOs, since the outbreak of the pandemic, steadily increased their use of words corresponding to leadership styles built around diversity, empathy, adaptability, and transformation, according to our language analysis,"" said Daniela Brandazza, Senior Director, S&amp;P Global Ratings. ""During times of economic uncertainty and workplace transformation, we believe this research provides data and insights to help us examine leadership styles that can contribute to a more equitable, productive, and sustainable working culture""Key findings of the report include:According to our language analysis of 6,831 corporate leaders of over 5,801 companies in the S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index, women CEOs, since the outbreak of the pandemic, steadily increased their use of words corresponding to leadership styles built around diversity, empathy, adaptability and transformation.Diversity replaced accountability as the most important trait of women CEOs' leadership styles by 2022. A transformational style that tends to inspire beyond expectations in emphasizing a vision that goes beyond self-interest emerged as the fourth most prevalent.Consistently for the past two years, women CEOs have exhibited a more positive communication style, as observed in their more frequent use of words like ""growth"", ""continue"", ""good"", and ""customer"". Both women and men CEOs continue to express negative sentiment at comparable frequency in their communication over the period.Women are still significantly underrepresented as CEOs globally, but slightly increased their share to 5.4% in 2022, compared with 5% in 2021. Both the real estate and health care sectors continue to lead with larger percentages of women CEOs.Story continuesThis article revisits S&amp;P Global's 2021 study about leadership during COVID-19, which concluded that while women CEOs' leadership style is different from male peers, it proved to be just as effective in terms of the financial performance of their companies.

TSN has strategically increased its presence through capacity expansions. The renowned leader in protein is well placed to capitalize on the rising demand for protein-packed brands.Let’s delve deeper.Capacity Expansions Driving GrowthTyson Foods is undertaking several operational and supply chain efficiency programs to position itself better in the long run. The company continues accelerating digitalization via supply chain planning and execution processes to enhance customer service. Management is optimizing its plant network by adding fully cooked capacity, converting plants for value-added production, executing plant flexibility and enhancing the portfolio mix. In its last earnings call, management highlighted investing in new plants and expanding existing capacity across its global network.The company has eight plants under construction, with two envisioned to start operation during fiscal 2022, while the other six would begin by the end of fiscal 2023. The incremental capacity will help the company counter capacity constraints, accelerate value-added growth and meet the rising consumer demand for protein. Management expects to invest nearly $1.9 billion in fiscal 2022, focused mainly on new capacity and automation objectives.Tyson Foods is focused on efforts to expand into international markets as part of its strategic growth plan. In Jul 2022, the company announced its strategic partnership with Tanmiah Food Company (Tanmiah) — a leading Middle Eastern provider of fresh and processed poultry, other processed meat products, animal feed and health products. The acquisitions will allow Tyson Foods to access poultry supplies across Saudi Arabia to cater to the rising protein demand in the Middle East and other markets.Several other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Industria e Comercio (""Hemmer""). The buyout has widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In June, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz. Prior to this, it acquired Texas-based pit-smoked meats company Sadler's Smokehouse in March 2020. The buyout was in sync with Hormel Foods’ initiatives to strengthen its position in the foodservice space.McCormick strategically increased its presence through acquisitions and strengthened its portfolio. In December 2020, MKC bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories.

It boasts a rich portfolio of protein-packed brands that are growing rapidly across the globe. The company has undertaken divesture of non-protein businesses to focus on the growing protein-packed food arena. TSN has been steadily expanding its fresh prepared foods offering, owing to consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics.We believe that such upsides and prudent expansion efforts will likely keep Tyson Food positioned in the meat foods space.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Recently, SYF broke through the 50-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.One of the three major moving averages, the 50-day simple moving average is commonly used by traders and analysts to determine support or resistance levels for different types of securities. However, the 50-day is considered to be more important since it's the first marker of an up or down trend.SYF has rallied 10.7% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests SYF could be on the verge of another move higher.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider SYF's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 4 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.Given this move in earnings estimate revisions and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on SYF for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The requirement would cover 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,"" the draft said.The finalised draft law is due to be published on Wednesday, with EU states and the European Parliament having the final say, meaning further changes are likely.The draft sets out a mandatory deadline for PSPs to receive instant payments in euros in the euro area six months after the new rules come into force. They would have to be able to send euro denominated instant payments within a year.Banks outside the euro area would have longer to comply.A cross-border euro IP should be priced at the same or a lower level than a corresponding regular cross-border euro credit transfer, the draft law proposes.

However, the upside was partly offset by elevated operating expenses.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter 2022 earnings announcement.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $2.57 has witnessed one upside revision and one downward movement in the past week. The estimate is indicative of an 8.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate of $2.61 per share earnings indicates a 10.2% year-over-year increase.Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for revenues are pegged at $5.7 billion, suggesting a 13.4% jump from the year-ago level.Mastercard beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average of 12.9%. This is depicted in the graph below.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseMastercard Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseMastercard Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteFactors to NoteMastercard’s third-quarter revenues are likely to have benefited from increased travel and entertainment related spendings. MA’s GDV (the dollar volume of activity on Mastercard-branded cards during a particular period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis) is likely to have benefited from an increased usage of its debit and credit cards, both within and outside the United States, in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mastercard’s total GDV for all MA-branded programs is pegged at $2,107 million, suggesting an 8.7% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $2,148.5 million.Story continuesProcessed transactions are likely to have witnessed an uptick in the third quarter owing to improved consumer spending and increased contactless acceptance initiatives pursued by the technology company. The consensus mark for the same indicates a 10.5% increase from the year-ago period’s reading.Increased cross-border travel might have favored cross-border volumes of Mastercard. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for cross-border volume fees is pegged at $1,619 million, hinting at a rise from $1,276 million a year ago.All the above-mentioned factors might boost Mastercard’s results for the third quarter, leading to significant growth from the prior-year quarter’s performance. Yet, the company is expected to have incurred escalated costs under rebates and incentives in the September quarter. This might have affected its margins.Moreover, Mastercard’s operating costs are likely to have significantly increased in the third quarter due to higher advertising, marketing and data processing costs, thereby hurting the bottom line and making an earnings beat uncertain. We expect total operating expense for the third quarter to have increased 13.2% from the prior-year quarter’s actuals.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mastercard this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: Mastercard has an Earnings ESP of -0.28%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.57 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Mastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Mastercard, here are some companies from the broader Business Services space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Shift4 Payments, Inc. FOUR has an Earnings ESP of +5.88% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Shift4 Payments’ bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 53.9% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. FOUR’s earnings beat estimates in two of the last four quarters, met the mark once and missed the same on another occasion, the average surprise being 4.2%.Marqeta, Inc. MQ has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marqeta’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter remained stable in the past week. MQ beat on earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark once, the average beat being 21.8%.Riot Blockchain, Inc. RIOT has an Earnings ESP of +125.49% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Riot Blockchain’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 3 cents per share, which has been revised upward twice in the past 30 days against once in the opposite direction.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.19%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.34%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.2%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 4.5% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.47% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.84% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Qualcomm as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be November 2, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $3.15, up 23.53% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $11.38 billion, up 21.91% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Qualcomm. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Qualcomm is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).Digging into valuation, Qualcomm currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.14. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 19.78, so we one might conclude that Qualcomm is trading at a discount comparatively.Investors should also note that QCOM has a PEG ratio of 0.59 right now.

171,ce5a8b67-6839-364e-9cde-769a6e97a981,LMT,2022-10-25,"Lockheed Martin Corporation's (NYSE:LMT) large institutional owners must be happy as stock continues to impress, up 15% over the past week",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-corporations-nyse-lmt-110103105.html,1666695663,STORY,['LMT'],"[If you want to know who really controls Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week’s 15% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 25%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lockheed Martin, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Lockheed Martin does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Lockheed Martin, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Lockheed Martin is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc. with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 6.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Lockheed Martin Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$76m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 23% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Lockheed Martin. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Lockheed Martin better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Backlog value at the end of the third quarter was $10.6 billion, which is an increase of 3% over the comparable prior year period.Given changing industry dynamics resulting primarily from Federal Reserve actions to raise interest rates, PulteGroup continues to reassess all pending transactions prior to completing the purchase of the underlying land asset. As a result of this ongoing review process, in the third quarter the Company elected to terminate a number of pending land transactions and wrote off $24 million of deposits and preacquisition expenses associated with the deals. The write-off of these costs is recorded in the Other expense, net line of the income statement.""For the past several years, we have systematically increased our use of land options with the dual objectives of enhancing returns and helping to mitigate market risks,"" said Bob O’Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO. ""With today’s more challenging market conditions, in the third quarter we chose to walk from certain options tied to future land investment where returns no longer met required performance metrics.""Pre-tax income for the Company's financial services operations was $28 million, down from $49 million last year. The decrease in pre-tax income for the period reflects both a reduction in loan volumes and the more competitive pricing environment that has existed for much of 2022. The reduction in loan volumes for the quarter was driven, in part, by a decline in capture rate to 77% compared with 85% last year.Pre-tax income for the Company’s third quarter was $811 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year. Income tax expense for the Company’s third quarter was $183 million, or an effective tax rate of 22.6%. The Company’s effective tax rate benefitted from federal energy efficient home credits recognized in the period resulting from the extension of such credits by the Inflation Reduction Act enacted into law in August.During the third quarter, PulteGroup repurchased 4.4 million, or 2% of its common shares for $180 million, at an average price of $41.20 per share. The Company ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 22.5%.A conference call discussing PulteGroup's third quarter 2022 results is scheduled for Tuesday, October 25, 2022, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

On the contrary, net sales increased 8% year over year but marginally lagged the consensus mark.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Masco’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.07 per share, suggesting a rise of 8.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of 99 cents. The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $2.26 billion, indicating a 2.7% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Masco Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMasco Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMasco Corporation price-eps-surprise | Masco Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteMasco is likely to have generated tepid earnings and revenues in third-quarter 2022. Slowness in the housing and repair, and remodel markets is likely to have ailed MAS’ top-line performance. The bottom line is expected to have been dented by intense inflationary pressure, particularly on commodities and logistics, and supply-chain issues in the quarter to be reported. Also, inflation is likely to have increased for raw material, freight and labor.Apart from the above-mentioned costs, MAS persistently incurs expenses related to product launches and acquisitions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products’ sales of $1,345 million indicates a 1.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The same for the Decorative Architectural Products segment’s sales is currently pegged at $920 million, calling for a 5.1% increase from the year-earlier quarter’s reported number.The consensus mark for Plumbing Products’ non-GAAP operating profit is pegged at $243 million, suggesting 2% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The same for Decorative Architectural Products’ non-GAAP operating profit is pegged at $160 million, implying a 3.6% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Masco this time around.

Weak sales of COVID-related medicines and tests hurt Roche's third-quarter sales. Eli Lilly andAbbVie announced small acquisitions.Recap of the Week's Most Important StoriesJ&amp;J Begins Q3 Earnings Season: J&amp;J reported better-than-expected third-quarter results as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Its Pharmaceuticals unit sales continued to do well. Sales also improved in the MedTech and Consumer segments. However, currency headwinds reduced its sales growth by 6% in the quarter amid a strengthening U.S. dollar. J&amp;J slightly lowered its sales outlook for the year due to expected currency headwinds. It also tightened its adjusted earnings guidance range.Roche's Q3 Revenues Dip: Roche's revenues in the third quarter declined 6% due to lower COVID-related sales in both the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics divisions as the effects of the pandemic declined in many countries. Roche said that the increase in COVID cases has not simultaneously boosted demand for tests and drugs. Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were down 6% in the third quarter, while the Diagnostics division sales declined 4%.Roche expects sales to remain stable or grow in the low-single digits (at constant exchange rates) in 2022. Core earnings per share are estimated to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range.Lilly to Buy Akouos for $610M: Lilly said that it is acquiring Boston-based Akouos for approximately $487 million plus a contingent value right for an aggregate amount up to approximately $610 million.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Low Risk Stocks To Buy In 2022. Amid the volatile market environment, investors are scurrying to pull out their investments and sit on cash stockpiles, or at the very least, move towards low risk assets. Interest in bonds is increasing as Treasury yields rise. Aggressive rate hikes to control inflation have pushed the S&amp;P 500 into bear territory, and investor sentiment is quite pessimistic as the benchmark S&amp;P 500 has declined about 22% year-to-date as of October 22. According to Ned Davis Research, a rally in the stock market in 2023 will not be sustainable unless traders do not abandon their investments amid a bear market. NDR's proprietary trading sentiment composite suggests that the market is in ""extreme pessimism"" territory, with bearish responses nearing 60% of market participants. The research firm noted:""Sentiment would need to remain subdued, providing a wall of worry for the market to climb...A quick jump from pessimism to optimism would signal the rally may have run its course."" Investors seeking safe and solid positions for their portfolios can take a look at firms like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). These businesses deliver resilient returns despite market downturns, have fortress balance sheets which allow them to recover from a hit to corporate earnings, and their customer loyalty keeps the businesses afloat even in the worst macro scenarios. Our Methodology We selected the following low risk stocks suitable based on optimistic analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and resilient dividend profiles. The betas for these firms were below 1.0 as of October 21, which means these stocks are less risky as compared to the broader market. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. These stocks are safe and thus offer good investment options in the current market backdrop. Story continues11 Best Low Risk Stocks To Buy In 2022Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBest Low Risk Stocks To Buy In 202211. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Beta Value: 0.72Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a London-based energy and petrochemical company with operations in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas. The company runs through Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions segments. On October 21, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced that it had resumed export operations from the Forcados oil terminal in Nigeria after a 10-week halt. On October 13, JPMorgan analyst Christyan Malek reiterated an Overweight rating on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) but trimmed the price target on the stock to 2,900 GBp from 3,000 GBp.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 39 hedge funds were long Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), with combined stakes worth $3.46 billion, compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter worth $5.6 billion. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 20.25 million shares worth $1.06 billion. In addition to Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is one of the best low risk stocks to invest in. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”10. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Beta Value: 0.72Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American company engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and Taiwan. On October 12, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on November 10, to shareholders of the company as of October 28. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the best low risk stocks to invest in. On October 5, Baird analyst Peter Benedict reiterated an Outperform rating and a $575 price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) after the company's September sales data. Primary comps of 8.6% were below the earlier six-month average growth rate of 9.6%, but they ""remained healthy"", the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 64 hedge funds were bullish on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 4.3 million shares worth $2 billion. Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever that can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”9. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Beta Value: 0.57PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is an American multinational manufacturer and distributor of beverages and convenient foods worldwide. On October 12, the company reported its Q3 2022 results, posting a non-GAAP EPS of $1.97 and a revenue of $21.97 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $0.12 and $1.15 billion, respectively. For FY2022, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) now expects a 12% increase in organic revenue versus the prior growth outlook of 10%, and total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.7 billion, consisting of dividends worth $6.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.5 billion. The core earnings per share are now expected to be $6.73, up from the prior outlook of $6.63 and the consensus of $6.70. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the best low risk stocks to buy in 2022. On October 14, Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman raised the price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $185 from $183 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst sees the company's ""beat and raise"" in Q3 as ""firmly characteristic"" of its ""flexibility that screens all the more attractive in the current operating environment.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 65 hedge funds were bullish on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 62 funds in the prior quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the leading position holder in the company, with more than 7 million shares worth $1.2 billion. Here is what ClearBridge Large Cap Value ESG Fund has to say about PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Also in the stable and predictable cash flow camp, though with a very different business model, global food and beverage company PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) reported very strong organic growth in the first quarter, driven by healthy price/mix, and raised revenue guidance, while holding EPS guidance. Notably, its beverage business showed expanding margins.”8. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Beta Value: 0.51Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the American multinational retail corporation, is one of the premier low risk stocks to buy in 2022. Morgan Stanley estimated that Walmart Plus added almost 2 million members since an early September estimate, bringing the total to nearly 18.5 million members or a 14.4% U.S. household penetration rate. The standalone value for Walmart Plus could be $45 billion, which is a bigger market cap than Coupang at $37 billion, eBay at $21 billion, Chewy at $16 billion, and Etsy at $14 billion. Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe on October 18 raised the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to $165 from $161 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares. As the value leader in retail, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is well positioned in the current environment, particularly as higher-income customers are trading down, the analyst told investors in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 67 funds reported owning stakes worth $3.8 billion in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of June 2022, compared to 60 funds in the earlier quarter worth $6.6 billion. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 9.82 million shares worth $1.2 billion.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco has been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Beta Value: 0.65AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) manufactures and sells pharmaceuticals worldwide. The company was incorporated in 2012 and is headquartered in North Chicago, Illinois. On October 20, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) announced that it is acquiring the UK-based DJS Antibodies for $255 million in cash to bolster its immunology pipeline. The company will also distribute a per share quarterly dividend of $1.41 to shareholders on November 15. It is one of the best low risk stocks to invest in. On October 13, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn kept an Overweight rating and a $185 price target on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) while calling the stock a ""Catalyst Driven Idea"", stating that the company's anti-TNF ADC Phase 2 data could open a new pipeline opportunity. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 71 hedge funds were bullish on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 76 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.82 million shares worth $1.2 billion. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”6. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80Beta Value: 0.96The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) operates as an American home improvement retailer. The company sells building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, and decor products. Cowen voiced clear preference for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) as compared to Lowe’s, noting that Home Depot is in a strong position to boost EBIT margins and capitalize and “harvest benefits following its investment cycle” to achieve share appreciation. Analyst Max Rakhlenko initiated coverage of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) with an Outperform rating and a $350 price target on October 19. He is constructive on the firm’s opportunity to gain share, increase sales productivity, and enhance EBIT margin as Home Depot's Pro ecosystem comes together. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 80 hedge funds held stakes worth $5.35 billion in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), compared to 75 funds in the earlier quarter worth $5.6 billion.

(NYSE:BRK-B), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), elite investors are piling into The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) as a safe haven amid the currently volatile market. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital specifically said about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a high-quality operator in the home improvement industry. Macroeconomic concerns, particularly the rise in mortgage rates, caused the share price to pull back and trade at a greater discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Home Depot is well positioned to continue gaining share due to its premium real estate locations, strong operations and recent investments in its supply chain. We like Home Depot’s exposure to the professional customer and believe in its ability to take market share in this segment as we believe home improvement spending has the potential to remain resilient in upcoming years.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Risk Stocks To Buy In 2022.  Suggested articles:15 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In15 Best Ecommerce Stocks To Buy13 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 11 Best Low Risk Stocks To Buy In 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
180,25d27c55-afde-3020-9f90-4d15de9b8167,JNJ,2022-10-25,Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-jnj-attracting-investor-130001776.html,1666616401,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +1.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.8% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson &amp; Johnson belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share, indicating a change of +4.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.05 points to a change of +2.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.30 indicates a change of +2.5% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $23.89 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -3.7%. The $95.09 billion and $98.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.4% and +3.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.2%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

181,b1da4cdf-6ef0-31e1-8882-51364b09bcbb,MDT,2022-10-25,Medtronic plc's (NYSE:MDT) Dismal Stock Performance Reflects Weak Fundamentals,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-plcs-nyse-mdt-dismal-120046265.html,1666699246,STORY,['MDT'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Medtronic's (NYSE:MDT) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.7% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually driven by a company’s fundamentals over the long term, which in this case look pretty weak, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators. Specifically, we decided to study Medtronic's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:9.9% = US$5.2b ÷ US$53b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Medtronic's Earnings Growth And 9.9% ROEWhen you first look at it, Medtronic's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 11%, we may spare it some thought. On the other hand, Medtronic reported a fairly low 4.8% net income growth over the past five years. Remember, the company's ROE is not particularly great to begin with. So this could also be one of the reasons behind the company's low growth in earnings.Story continuesWe then compared Medtronic's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 19% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is MDT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Medtronic Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?With a high three-year median payout ratio of 67% (or a retention ratio of 33%), most of Medtronic's profits are being paid to shareholders. This definitely contributes to the low earnings growth seen by the company.Additionally, Medtronic has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 42% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Medtronic's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 15%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Medtronic. The company has seen a lack of earnings growth as a result of retaining very little profits and whatever little it does retain, is being reinvested at a very low rate of return. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

In that same time, the Medical sector gained 1.38%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.84%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Medtronic as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 22, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Medtronic to post earnings of $1.28 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 3.03%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.72 billion, down 1.67% from the year-ago period.MDT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.53 per share and revenue of $31.55 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -0.36% and -0.43%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Medtronic should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

The 10-year yield was last seen at 4.17% after hitting a 15-year high at 4.34% on Friday.The indexes notched their biggest weekly percentage gains in four months on Friday, also supported by better-than-expected earnings reports.Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Microsoft Corp will report on Tuesday, followed by Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc on Thursday.The earnings reports from the four biggest U.S. companies by market capitalization could test a nascent rally on Wall Street as stocks claw their way back from the latest lows.""I think the bar for success for mega cap companies is relatively low. Therefore, the reaction function to the actual earnings will likely be positive,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.

188,c0e5e749-a0c2-3729-8f95-3a062c9cf105,GT,2022-10-25,Goodyear (GT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goodyear-gt-expected-beat-earnings-140002283.html,1666620002,STORY,['GT'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Goodyear (GT) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis tire maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.3%.Revenues are expected to be $5.57 billion, up 13% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.78% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goodyear?For Goodyear, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.13%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Goodyear will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Goodyear would post earnings of $0.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.46, delivering a surprise of +6.98%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Goodyear appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment.

Also, customer concentration is a woe.However, given the increase in mobile data usage, spectrum availability and high network investments by wireless carriers to deploy 5G networks, Crown Castle is poised to gain from this upbeat trend in the upcoming period.Its efforts to double small-cell deployments in 2023 will likely act as a tailwind.

You can skip our detailed analysis of European dividend stocks and their returns, and go directly to read 5 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. After a pandemic-related slump in global dividend payments, companies around the world raised and reinstated their dividends to a record level. Dividends in Europe and the US fell by $100 billion in 2020 but recovered as soon as the market regained its footing last year. This year’s returns of European dividend stocks show their superior performance to their counterparts. The AlphaDEX European Dividend Index, which tracks the performance of Europe-domiciled dividend companies, reported a decline of 18.5% in 2022 so far, versus a 21.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of October 21.In its second quarter 2022 global dividend report, Janus Henderson Investors mentioned that the UK and Europe were the main driving forces in the global payout surge. Dividends in Europe grew by 28.7% on an underlying basis, amounting to $165.8 billion. The report also mentioned that special dividends paid by European companies also grew by 2.5% in Q2, from the previous quarter. Another report by Forbes cited the data of Henderson International Income Trust, which mentioned that dividends from UK companies will head for record payments this year for the first time since 2008. This growth will be attributed to rising oil prices that have significantly contributed to the growing revenues of many companies in the FTSE 100. With the global surge in dividend stocks this year, companies like Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) are gaining ground among investors due to their solid dividend policies.According to analysts, Europe’s recovering stock market has a lot to offer to investors in terms of dividends and capital gains. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs analyst Guillaume Jaisson spoke to Bloomberg about European dividend equities. He said that high-yielding stocks in Europe have started to outperform as they are less sensitive to rising bond yields. He further mentioned that dividends in Stoxx Europe 600 Index are expected to grow by 10% this year, mainly driven by energy and bank stocks.Story continues10 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: samranwara31 / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are European businesses that pay dividends to shareholders.

ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”9.

With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”7.

Here is what the firm has to say:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multi-national companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Video Conferencing Stocks To Invest In10 Cheap Value Stocks To Buy12 Small Cap Ecommerce Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Keytruda’s sales is $5.41 billion.Higher alliance revenues from Lynparza, driven by continued uptake across multiple approved indications globally, may have boosted oncology sales. Please note that Merck markets Lynparza in partnership with AstraZeneca AZN.AstraZeneca and Merck formed a profit-sharing deal to co-market Lynparza and Koselugo in July 2017.AstraZeneca and Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is also being evaluated in an earlier-line setting for the approved cancer indicationsAlliance revenues from Lenvima may have also boosted oncology sales.In the hospital specialty portfolio, higher demand due to recovery in surgical procedures and an increase in market share may have benefitedsales of neuromuscular blockade medicine — Bridion injection. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bridion is $392 million, while our estimate is $377.3 million.Story continuesMerck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics’ oral antiviral pill to treat COVID-19, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) is not likely to have been a major contributor of top-line growth in the third quarter like the first two quarters of the year. Based on the supply and purchase agreements in place, Merck expected Lagevrio to generate $5 billion to $5.5 billion in revenues in 2022 of which $5.01 is already recorded in the first half of 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our estimate for Lagevrio is $300 million.With regard to the HPV vaccine, Gardasil, ex-U.S. sales are expected to have been driven by strong demand in China and increased supply in the third quarter. The unfavorable timing of CDC purchasing, which hurt U.S. sales in the second quarter, is likely to have reversed in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gardasil is $$2.09 billion while our estimate is $2.0 billion.Meanwhile, the top line is expected to have witnessed the impact of loss of U.S. market exclusivity for drugs like Remicade, Noxafil and Zetia. Continued pricing pressure and possible generic competition in international markets like China and Europe may have hurt sales of the diabetes franchise (Januvia/Janumet).The Animal Health franchise should continue to see strong sales growth.

The (WMB) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis pipeline operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.7 billion, up 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.28% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Williams Companies, Inc. The?For Williams Companies, Inc. The, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.53%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Williams Companies, Inc. The will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Williams Companies, Inc. The would post earnings of $0.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.40, delivering a surprise of +8.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Williams Companies, Inc. The appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He still must decide on what remedy should be imposed after making the determination.The revised guidelines detail ""when and how department employees work with victims and witnesses of crime to ensure that their voices are heard and that they are protected during criminal justice proceedings,"" the Justice Department said.In December, some victims' relatives argued the department violated their rights when it struck the January 2021 agreement with Boeing over the two crashes in a five-month period that killed 346 people.The families argued the U.S. government ""lied and violated their rights through a secret process,"" and asked a judge to rescind Boeing's immunity from criminal prosecution, which was part of the $2.5 billion agreement, and arraigning Boeing on the felony charges.The revised guidelines significantly expand support for people significantly harmed by crime but may not meet the statutory definition of ""victim."" They also require earlier notification and consultation and say ""prosecutors should, as appropriate, notify victims of plea agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, and non-prosecution agreements before a charging document is filed.""Attorney General Merrick Garland said ""the revised guidelines will ensure that we continue to fulfill our obligations to victims and witnesses.""Garland met virtually in January with families of some Boeing crash victims but the department stood by the 2021 plea agreement. In February, the department apologized ""for not meeting and conferring with these crash victims' beneficiaries before entering into"" the deferred prosecution agreement.Story continuesO'Connor ruled on Friday that ""in sum, but for Boeing's criminal conspiracy to defraud the (Federal Aviation Administration), 346 people would not have lost their lives in the crashes.""The Justice Department and Boeing declined comment on the ruling.Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, said the department ""clearly violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by secretly negotiating an agreement that granted Boeing immunity from criminal prosecution.""The Justice Department deal capped a 21-month investigation into the design and development of the 737 MAX following the two crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, recently announced the availability of an initial portfolio of off-the-shelf long-read gene panels — Twist Alliance panels — in collaboration with Twist Bioscience Corporation. These fixed panels have been designed to capture target regions in a cost-effective and high throughput manner. Customers will also have the ability to develop a fully customizable and scalable panel of their design for sequencing with PacBio HiFi reads.PacBio and Twist Bioscience have collaborated with researchers of renowned institutions to develop two Alliance panels. One panel includes coverage of nearly 400 challenging medically relevant genes, while the other was designed to capture 50 pharmacogenomic genes.Apart from new capabilities provided by the long-read panels, PacBio is also collaborating with Twist Bioscience to demonstrate the high level of accuracy that can be achieved using sequencing by binding (SBB) chemistry.This latest availability is expected to significantly expand PacBio’s market share for sequencing, thus strengthening its global foothold.Significance of the AvailabilityPer the press release, many of the challenging genes are in the dark regions of the human genome (the complete set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism), which are difficult to sequence or accurately map using standard short-read sequencing technologies. PacBio and Twist Bioscience developed the dark gene panel with researchers to interrogate and detect around 400 hard-to-sequence genes of medical significance which are associated with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease.PacBio believes that SBB’s accuracy, when applied to whole-exome sequencing, can potentially provide a complete coverage of both uncomplicated and traditionally difficult-to-sequence genes. This, in turn, could streamline workflows by reducing the necessity for orthogonal assays.Story continuesPer PacBio’s management, the partnership with Twist Bioscience enabled it to develop off-the-shelf products that are expected to meet its customers’ needs for a way to focus their long-read experiments and maximize throughput.Twist Bioscience’s management feels that the panels developed in association with PacBio will likely enable customers to sequence regions of the genome that can aid researchers in studying the role of genetics in drug response. This is expected to enable them to uncover regions that are difficult to read, such as dark genes and genes associated with neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Mynewsdesk, the global genome sequencing market is projected to reach $46.43 billion in 2028 from $13.58 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 19.2%. Factors like the rising prevalence of genetic disorders, continued mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the need for disease management are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is expected to significantly strengthen PacBio’s global business.Recent DevelopmentsPacBio, this month, announced the creation of the Consortium for Long Read Sequencing, which aims to accelerate the utility of long-read human genome datasets.Last month, PacBio announced the availability of a new computational analysis method — Tandem Repeat Genotyping Tool — for profiling a huge volume of tandem repeats across the human genome using its long-read HiFi sequencing data.Comparison With PeersPacBio’s peer in the sequencing space, Illumina, Inc. ILMN, announced a partnership with genomics company GenoScreen this month. The tie-up is aimed at accelerating the progress to end tuberculosis (TB) worldwide by expanding capabilities for countries most impacted by TB to more effectively detect and combat multidrug-resistant TB.The same month, ILMN announced a strategic research collaboration with AstraZeneca. Through this partnership, Illumina and AstraZeneca aim to accelerate drug target discovery by combining their strengths in artificial intelligence-based genome interpretation and genomic analysis techniques along with industry expertise.Another renowned name in the sequencing space and PacBio’s peer is Qiagen N.V. QGEN. This month, QGEN announced the certification of its leading in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) kit and its fully automated NeuMoDx platforms under the European Union’s new In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR), replacing the previous IVDD rules since May. The ipsogen JAK2 RGQ PCR (polymerase chain reaction) Kit used for myeloproliferative neoplasms (a certain type of blood cancer) is now QIAGEN’s first IVD kit with IVDR CE-marking under Class C.Last month, QIAGEN announced new additions to its comprehensive NeuMoDx assay menu for organ transplant-associated viruses. The new assays for the identification and quantification of the Epstein-Barr virus and the human herpesvirus 6 have received CE-IVD certification for the European Union and other countries that accept this marking.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. TMO is another renowned peer of PacBio in the niche space. This month, TMO unveiled the Gibco CTS DynaCellect Magnetic Separation System to help cell therapy developers easily move from process and clinical development to commercial manufacturing.The same month, Thermo Fisher announced the launch of the TaqPath Enteric Bacterial Select Panel, a CE-IVD marked panel designed to detect common gastrointestinal bacteria and help clinicians identify the root cause of an infection and administer the most appropriate treatment to their patients more quickly.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Southern Southern Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Comptroller, Ann Daiss, for US$506k worth of shares, at about US$67.47 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$64.59. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Southern insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Southern Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Southern insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$163m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Southern Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Southern insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Southern you should be aware of.Of course Southern may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

210,65db48e0-2275-3e3f-bdf2-94e0eee48d01,CI,2022-10-25,Here's Why Cigna (CI) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-cigna-ci-great-160004640.html,1666627204,STORY,['CI'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Cigna (CI), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Cigna currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CI that show why this health insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For CI, shares are up 2.4% over the past week while the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry is up 0.28% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.49% compares favorably with the industry's 1.08% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Cigna have increased 9.43% over the past quarter, and have gained 39.25% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -5.76% and -16.13%, respectively.Investors should also take note of CI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, CI is averaging 2,007,888 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CI.Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CI's consensus estimate, increasing from $22.96 to $23.00 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CI is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Cigna on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

212,8696f153-9f92-3698-a973-32ced00eacee,CI,2022-10-25,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Cigna Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-cigna-123012830.html,1666614612,STORY,['CI'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Cigna (CI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Cigna's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Cigna's main business drivers.Headquartered in Bloomfield, CT and formed in 1982, Cigna Corp. is the result of a merger between Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and Insurance Company of North America. Cigna completed its combination with Express Scripts Holding Company by 2018-end. Shares of the new combined company have started trading on the NYSE under the stock ticker symbol “CI.”The health service company updated its segment names to align with the launch of Evernorth and to better reflect a suite of services offered across its portfolio. With divesting its life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses to Chubb for $5.75 billion, it focuses more on the profitable global health services portfolio. The segment previously reported as Health Services is now reported as Evernorth and the segment previously reported as Integrated Medical is now reported as U.S Medical. There are no changes to the underlying businesses reported in either segment.Evernorth (constitutes 92.2% of total revenues in 2021) includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services, including pharmacy services, benefits management, care solutions and data and analytics, which are provided to health plans, employers, government organizations, and health care providers.Cigna Healthcare (7.8%): The segment comprises of Cigna's U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government, and International Health businesses that provide comprehensive medical and coordinated solutions to clients and customers.Cigna's U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government businesses combined previously used to report as U.S. Medical. The businesses are retained by the company and reported in the newly created International Health operating segment that will be aggregated with its existing U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government operating segments in the renamed Cigna Healthcare reporting segment.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Cigna ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $6,068.06, or a gain of 506.81%, as of October 24, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 161.85% and gold's return of -6.50% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for CI.Cigna’s revenues have been increasing consistently for the past few years, driven by acquisitions, superior operating performance and a high-quality product portfolio. Business streamlining by divesting its life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses to Chubb helps it to focus on core growth areas. Increasing medical membership on the back of a diversified product portfolio, wide agent network and superior service are major positives. The company has been resorting to prudent capital deployment moves. For 2022, Cigna expects adjusted income from operations to be at least $22.90 per share. Its shares have outperformed the industry year to date. However, high leverage can affect its financial flexibility. Rising operating costs might dent the company's margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.The stock is up 8.49% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.19%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.34%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.18%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 10.81% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.47% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.84% in that time.Skyworks Solutions will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 3, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.91, up 11.07% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.4 billion, up 7.07% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Skyworks Solutions. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Skyworks Solutions is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Skyworks Solutions has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.42 right now. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.45.It is also worth noting that SWKS currently has a PEG ratio of 0.65. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductors - Radio Frequency was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.13 at yesterday's closing price.Story continuesThe Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 180, which puts it in the bottom 29% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

""Ye’s recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company’s values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness. After a thorough review, the company has taken the decision to terminate the partnership with Ye immediately, end production of Yeezy branded products and stop all payments to Ye and his companies. Adidas will stop the adidas Yeezy business with immediate effect.""The parting of ways comes amid increased pressure on social media and among investors for Adidas to move beyond West and its Yeezy line. Adidas stock, down 64% so far in 2022, continued to fall as West's bizarre rants intensified.In ending their relationship, Adidas will have a huge hole to fill financially: The popular Yeezy line represents about $1-$2 billion in annual sales for the company, according to Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad.""We see big risk around the Yeezy franchise,"" Saad said in a recent note to clients.Besides the West drama, Adidas is entering wounded into the holiday season — the latest retailer to get flat-foot operationally as global economies have slowed. That poor execution has primarily led to a glut of Adidas inventory that will have to be aggressively marked down at the expense of profits, the company warned a week ago.Adidas said third quarter sales rose a lackluster 4% in the third quarter excluding the impact of volatile currencies. Sales in China tanked by a double-digit percentage.The company warned (its second warning of the year) that profits would be about 60% lower than its previous expectations. Operating profit margins for the year are seen at 4% compared to a prior goal of 7%.Story continuesKanye West and Carine Roitfeld attend the Givenchy Ready to Wear Spring/Summer 2023 fashion show as part of the Paris Fashion Week on October 2, 2022 in Paris, France.

(NKE) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-nike-inc-130001703.html,1666616401,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned -8.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has lost 9.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -15.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 points to a change of -20.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -21.3%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 indicates a change of +26.1% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -18.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Nike.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $48.97 billion and $52.84 billion estimates indicate +4.8% and +7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.91%. The EPS surprise was +2.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that report, analysts expect Pfizer to post earnings of $1.54 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 14.93%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $21.04 billion, down 12.69% from the year-ago period.PFE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.39 per share and revenue of $99.27 billion.

Expect a 10,000% markup per dose in 2023If you plan on getting boosted against COVID-19 this winter, then you might want to do it sooner rather than later. Pfizer’s COVID vaccine is going to cost more in the coming months as the pharmaceutical company announced it will nearly quadruple the price of a shot in 2023.Once the U.S. government uses up the doses it’s already bought — expected to be sometime in the first few months of 2023 — Pfizer will up the price, charging as much as $130 for a single dose of the vaccine, which will replace the multidose under the name Comirnaty.The price hike is about 100 times what it costs to actually manufacture the drug, and amounts to a 10,000% markup, according to estimates from international nonprofit Oxfam based on data from consumer advocacy Public Citizen and the Imperial College, London.While insurance companies knew prices would rise after the existing supply of doses ran out, analysis from the Kaiser Family Fund shows they anticipated the new cost would be around $100. The pharmaceutical juggernaut has explained the move as necessary to keep revenues up as demand for the shots wanes.Don't missWorried your cash is trash?

You could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect income every quarter)The government has been covering the costsThe American government has covered the cost of vaccines distributed in the country since they were developed and started being distributed in late 2020. It bought more than 500 million doses from Pfizer, and paid between $20 and $30 each.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 265 million people, or 80% of the U.S. population, are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. But fewer than 20 million have taken the latest booster, signaling that demand is dropping precipitously.Read more: ‘Stocks and bonds are toast’: Robert Kiyosaki warns central banks can’t fix inflation and that ‘fake’ money is forcing state pensions to pivot — here are 3 real assets he likes nowStory continuesAnd while the cost seems astronomical, Pfizer reportedly said that it expects people who have private health insurance or coverage through public programs like Medicare or Medicaid won’t have to pay out of pocket for their shots.Fewer people getting boostedVaccine producers have been in a bit of a pickle. As demand for the vaccine has waned, investors' concerns about a drop in earnings have been growing.Analysts surveyed by Factset had said they expected the company’s sales to decline given the anticipated slowdown in vaccinations. And while the price hike will help the company cushion the blow of softening demand, the announced increase by Pfizer was higher than many people expected.And it will likely have repercussions for other vaccine manufacturers, like Moderna.Moderna’s shares are down 46% this year — but the company did see a 9% boost last week when news of Pfizer’s plans was released. Moderna, for its part, is also expected to raise the price of its vaccine to a more affordable $60, according to Barron’s.And while this might be comforting news for investors, it’s not all that comforting for anyone who still needs a shot or a boost.What to read nextInflation eating away at your budget?

It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”8.

For more tech stock declines, go to 5 Biggest Tech Stock Drops in 2022. If there is one thing that can be said with certainty about the stock market right now, it's that the market is officially in bear mode. This means that all major stock indexes, and shares, have now entered a protracted period of share price drops. These drops have been caused by the macroeconomic environment, and they are the result of several factors. One factor is inflation, as rising prices have hit consumer purchasing power and forced them to concentrate most of their spending resources on essential items. For large companies, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), this means that the money consumers might have allocated for a smartphone or a personal computing purchase is simply not there.The other is the drastic increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which is estimated to hike the rate to 5% by May next year, according to the traders betting on the futures market. The current rate sits at 3.25% and the new bets suggest that at least one massive 75 basis point and two 50 basis point hikes are headed our way.Taking stock of the current situation for major stock indexes reveals that the picture is far from pretty. For instance, the NASDAQ Composite Index is down by 31% year to date, the S&amp;P 500 index is down by 22%, the DOW Jones Industrial Average by 15%, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by 18%.In this article we will focus on major tech stocks that fell sharply this year.

(NASDAQ:META) is down roughly 60%, and Carmax, Eurofins Scientific, Coherent and Ciena have lost about half their value. I’m wearing a dunce cap for Meta, as the changes Apple made to privacy tracking severely impacted Meta’s effectiveness at targeting ads to the right consumers. However, despite being compared recently to AOL by one analyst, Meta continues to capture enormous amounts of consumer attention: roughly 2.9 billion people use one of its sites every day. I believe it has a very long runway on monetizing those eyeballs, especially outside North America. For all its problems with ad tracking, and despite heavy investment in the so called metaverse, Meta should earn about $10 per share in 2022 and more next year. The stock, at $136 on September 30, reflects pessimism that Meta will ever recover. We’re holding because we think that Meta has the resources to improve its advertising efficiency, and that it eventually will.”6. Confluent, Inc.

SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 24, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, PayPal announced it is adding passkeys as an easy and secure log in method for PayPal accounts. Passkeys are a new industry standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium that replace passwords with cryptographic key pairs, offering customers a simple and secure way to log in to PayPal based on technology that is resistant to phishing and designed so that there is no shared passkey data between platforms. The new PayPal log in option will first be available to iPhone, iPad, or Mac users on PayPal.com and will expand to additional platforms as those platforms add support for passkeys.PayPal introduces passkeys as an easy and secure log in method for PayPal accounts.A founding member of the FIDO Alliance, PayPal is one of the first financial services companies to make passkeys widely available to its users. This cutting-edge security standard is significant as passkeys address one of the biggest security problems on the web, which is the weakness of password authentication. Over 2.6 billion records were hacked in 2017 and of these hacks, 81% are estimated to have been caused by password stealing and guessing1. Many consumers recycle passwords across online services, which can not only be cumbersome but can also lead consumers to reuse the same, potentially vulnerable passwords across services. Passkeys are designed to replace passwords for an even more seamless and secure login experience with PayPal.Passkeys will also help more consumers complete their purchases with PayPal - once PayPal users create a passkey, they won't have to remember their password, allowing them to check out with greater ease. According to a recent survey of U.S. consumers, 44% of consumers have abandoned an online purchase because they forgot a password.2Story continues""Launching passkeys for PayPal is foundational to our commitment to offering our customers safe, secure and easy ways to access and manage their daily financial lives,"" said Doug Bland, SVP and GM, Head of Consumer, PayPal. ""We are excited to provide our customers a more seamless checkout experience that eliminates the risks of weak and reused credentials and removes the frustration of remembering a password. We are making it easier for customers to shop online.""How to Create a PayPal PasskeyCreating and using a passkey with PayPal is a quick and easy process on an Apple device. Once created, passkeys are synced with iCloud Keychain, ensuring a strong, private relationship between a customer and their device, and an easy sign-in experience for PayPal users with devices running iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, or macOS Ventura.Once existing customers log in to PayPal with a browser on desktop or mobile web using their existing PayPal credentials such as a username and password, they will have the option to ""Create a passkey.""Customers will then be prompted to authenticate with Apple Face ID or Touch ID. Then the passkey will be automatically created, and next time PayPal customers log in, they won't need to use or manage a password again.PayPal Passkeys Can Be Used to Log In on Any Device If they have devices that don't support passkeys yet, users can still use an iPhone to log in with a PayPal passkey. Users simply scan the QR code that will appear after they enter their PayPal User ID.PayPal passkeys will start rolling out today to customers in the U.S.. PayPal passkeys will become available in additional countries early in 2023, and on additional technology platforms as they add support for passkeys.About PayPalPayPal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution for more than 20 years. By leveraging technology to make financial services and commerce more convenient, affordable, and secure, the PayPal platform is empowering more than 429 million consumers and merchants in more than 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.

To help schools worldwide proactively prepare for and respond to cyberattacks, IBM (NYSE:IBM) today announced the first eight recipients of the 2022 IBM Education Security Preparedness Grants, totaling $5 million in in-kind services. Each grant will sponsor IBM Service Corps volunteers to address the selected school districts' cybersecurity resiliency.As the FBI, DHS CISA, and MS-ISCA anticipate an increase in cyberattacks against schools during the 2022/2023 academic year, schools are bracing for potential attacks and the significant costs that follow. With cybercriminals continuing to view schools as compelling targets, IBM's 2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report* revealed that the cost of a data breach averages $3.86 million for education institutions. While the report found that 49% of data breaches the industry experienced were caused by a malicious attack, nearly 30% occurred due to human error, emphasizing the need for proper cybersecurity training and education in schools.The IBM Education Security Preparedness Grants program, now in its second year, received more than 120 applications from schools across the U.S. and will award six school districts with grants. This year the program is also expanding overseas with grant recipients in Ireland and UAE being announced today, and with recipients in Costa Rica and Brazil to be announced at a later date.The 2022 IBM Education Security Preparedness Grant recipients are:City of Dublin Educational Training Board - IrelandMohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence - UAECupertino Union School District - Sunnyvale, CARossville Cons.

Cyberattacks on schools do not only impact the schools themselves, as the aftermath cascades down to students and their families, creating a very palpable effect on their communities,"" said Charles Henderson, Global Managing Partner, and Head of IBM Security X-Force. ""We're proud to be able to support schools through this initiative, now in its second year, by helping to address critical gaps in security resources and planning and preparedness.""The grant applications that IBM received shed light on the schools' levels of cybersecurity awareness, preparedness, and training, confirming that there is always a growing need for improved security education and skills across industries and around the world.Key findings from applications included:Targets of Cyberattacks - One in four applicants has experienced a cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack, indicating that cybercriminals are taking advantage of the sector's security constraints.Absence of Readiness - The majority of school districts say they do not have a cybersecurity plan in place and have not received any cybersecurity training, increasing the security risk posed by human error.Lack of Resources - Just 20% of districts have personnel dedicated to cybersecurity.Now in its second year, this program has already benefited schools across the country. Barrett Puschus, Director of Information Technology at Brevard Public Schools, and one of the six recipients of the 2021 Education Security Preparedness grant, said ""Before this grant, we were completely lacking in confidence in our cybersecurity. The IBM team came in and showed us how to create a cybersecurity strategy and plan for emergencies based on our needs. We feel optimistic about our cybersecurity posture today thanks to IBM's help. The IBM team was populated with top-tier experts and our team benefited greatly from all their knowledge and experience. If you have data and systems worth protecting, as all schools do, this program is extremely worthwhile.""IBM Service Corps volunteers are expected to be working with the schools to help them proactively prepare for and respond to cyber threats. Depending on each school's needs, the engagements may include the creation of incident response plans, ransomware playbooks, updating technology, cybersecurity training for school communities, and more.""We're excited to be launching this program for the second year in a row as part of IBM's Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives to help schools strengthen their security postures in response to the growing threats in the education space,"" said Patrice Key-Rhone, Global Director of Employee Giving &amp; Volunteerism at IBM.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this refiner have returned +21.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.8% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Marathon Petroleum belongs, has gained 11.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $6.80 per share, indicating a change of +831.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.41 points to a change of +855.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +7.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.18 indicates a change of -43.7% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marathon Petroleum.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $35.67 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.4%. The $163.14 billion and $134.81 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +34.9% and -17.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $54.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +81.8%. EPS of $10.61 for the same period compares with $0.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +63.08%. The EPS surprise was +15.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pricing remains strong. Demand remains strong.""""We're still feeling very good"" about the short-term environment, Jacobson added, saying GM expects U.S. industry sales next year of 15 million, compared with expectations of around 13.7 million this year.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note called the results a ""major step in the right direction for the Detroit stalwart.""Chief Executive Mary Barra was more measured on a call with analysts Tuesday, describing the current operating environment as ""challenging,"" while noting a ""gradual improvement"" in supply chains, including semiconductor chips.Barra said the company ""completed and shipped nearly 75% of the unfinished vehicles we held in the company inventory in June.""GM's upbeat comments were in marked contrast to Ford Motor Co's warning in mid-September that inflation-related supplier costs were running about $1 billion higher than expected and that it would have 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles in inventory lacking parts.Ford reports third-quarter results on Wednesday.GM reaffirmed its guidance for full-year net income of $9.6 billion to $11.2 billion, and full-year diluted earnings per share of $5.76 to $6.76.Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of $2.25 topped estimates for $1.88.The automaker reported net income of $3.3 billion, compared with $2.4 billion a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $41.9 billion, from $26.8 billion a year ago.Story continuesThe company said 90% of its operating profit came from North America, where it earned $3.9 billion mostly from trucks and SUVs. GM boosted prices on vehicles sold in North America by an average of $2,678 per vehicle.EBIT-adjusted net margin in North America climbed nearly a point, to 11.2%.GM has received 170,000 reservations for the new Chevrolet Silverado EV pickup, which arrives at U.S. dealers next spring.Barra said the company will ramp up EV production more slowly than anticipated, due to a ""slightly slower launch"" of battery and cell production. It now plans to build a total of 400,000 EVs in North America through early 2024, about six months later than planned.GM said it continues to negotiate supply agreements and direct investments in raw materials to help drive EV growth beyond 2025.Its majority-owned Cruise automated driving unit now expects revenue of $1 billion in 2025, said GM, which plans to begin operating a robotaxi service in three cities by the end of this year.The automaker posted a loss of $497 million on Cruise during the quarter, with a cumulative year-to-date loss of $1.4 billion.(Reporting by Ben Klayman, Paul Lienert and Joseph White, Editing by Kirsten Donovan, Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski)]"

TSN has strategically increased its presence through capacity expansions. The renowned leader in protein is well placed to capitalize on the rising demand for protein-packed brands.Let’s delve deeper.Capacity Expansions Driving GrowthTyson Foods is undertaking several operational and supply chain efficiency programs to position itself better in the long run. The company continues accelerating digitalization via supply chain planning and execution processes to enhance customer service. Management is optimizing its plant network by adding fully cooked capacity, converting plants for value-added production, executing plant flexibility and enhancing the portfolio mix. In its last earnings call, management highlighted investing in new plants and expanding existing capacity across its global network.The company has eight plants under construction, with two envisioned to start operation during fiscal 2022, while the other six would begin by the end of fiscal 2023. The incremental capacity will help the company counter capacity constraints, accelerate value-added growth and meet the rising consumer demand for protein. Management expects to invest nearly $1.9 billion in fiscal 2022, focused mainly on new capacity and automation objectives.Tyson Foods is focused on efforts to expand into international markets as part of its strategic growth plan. In Jul 2022, the company announced its strategic partnership with Tanmiah Food Company (Tanmiah) — a leading Middle Eastern provider of fresh and processed poultry, other processed meat products, animal feed and health products. The acquisitions will allow Tyson Foods to access poultry supplies across Saudi Arabia to cater to the rising protein demand in the Middle East and other markets.Several other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Industria e Comercio (""Hemmer""). The buyout has widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In June, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz. Prior to this, it acquired Texas-based pit-smoked meats company Sadler's Smokehouse in March 2020. The buyout was in sync with Hormel Foods’ initiatives to strengthen its position in the foodservice space.McCormick strategically increased its presence through acquisitions and strengthened its portfolio. In December 2020, MKC bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick acquired the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand.Story continuesStrength in Protein-Packed BrandsTyson Foods focuses on higher protein production to cater to the rising demand for protein-packed food. It boasts a rich portfolio of protein-packed brands that are growing rapidly across the globe. The company has undertaken divesture of non-protein businesses to focus on the growing protein-packed food arena. TSN has been steadily expanding its fresh prepared foods offering, owing to consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics.We believe that such upsides and prudent expansion efforts will likely keep Tyson Food positioned in the meat foods space.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for CSX How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CSX is:32% = US$4.1b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.32 in profit.Does CSX Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, CSX has a better ROE than the average (26%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining CSX's Debt And Its 32% Return On EquityCSX does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.40. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.19%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.34%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.18%.Heading into today, shares of the semiconductor maker had gained 3.29% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.47% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.84% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Analog Devices as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Analog Devices to post earnings of $2.58 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 49.13%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.16 billion, up 35.18% from the year-ago period.ADI's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.43 per share and revenue of $11.93 billion.

These companies are a hedge against inflation because of their ability to generate steady cash flows through rental income. In addition to this, these stocks also offer above-average dividend yields to shareholders with constant dividend streams. REITs have seen tremendous growth over the past few decades in the US and currently hold a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, according to a report by Global X. The report also mentioned that REITs make up 9% of the total commercial property market which is collectively worth over $20 trillion.REITs were badly hit during the pandemic due to construction delays and reduced operating income. However, the sector gained a foothold next year, delivering strong returns to shareholders. According to a report by Nareit, REITs returned 29% in 2021 through December 1. Another report by the same association mentioned that the FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index has outperformed the broader market in 15 of the past 25 years.Historically, REITs have performed well in periods of high inflation. This performance was attributed to rental contracts and a steady rise in construction projects. Global X referred to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which showed that REITs outperformed global equities from February 28 2005 to July 31, 2022. As mentioned above, high dividends make REITs one of the most reliable investment options. Especially in inflationary periods, their dividends are rewarding for shareholders because of high yields. Over the past 10 years ending August 31, the dividend growth in the sector has averaged 4.5%, compared with average annual inflation of 2.8%.Story continuesWith these factors in mind, we have selected some of the best REIT stocks for diverse portfolios that would help generate stable income during these times.

It's United Way season.""I recruit everybody,"" said Newburn, a wealth advisor with Regions' Private Wealth Management team in Tyler, Texas, of his request to associates to help with the United Way of Smith County Day of Caring. ""Everyone is willing to serve, we get incredible support.""The ability to rely on that support from Newburn, his teammates and other companies who help with the Day of Caring is a gamechanger for the United Way affiliate and the 26 partner agencies it serves.""Bill is invaluable,"" said Lisa Gardner, director of Community Impact with United Way of Smith County. ""He is so encouraging in engaging his colleagues to volunteer.""The annual service project has been a labor of love for Newburn for several years. He also supports United Way throughout the year as the organization's board treasurer.""We've painted before, we've packed food for kids in need, whatever we can do to help,"" said Newburn of previous projects the Tyler group has tackled. ""This year, the United Way itself needed some landscape work. It was quite a project but very rewarding when we completed it.""The result?""The work the Regions team did spreading mulch and rock in our flowerbeds and power washing the sidewalks and driveways made our landscaping look brand new,"" said Gardner.Fellow Regions Private Wealth Management associate Shelly Gist shares Newburn's sense of excitement when the United Way of Northeast Arkansas' Day of Caring occurs each year in Jonesboro.""I can't recall missing a Day of Caring in the last 10 years,"" said Gist, a Trust support administrator. ""It may actually be closer to 15.""Gist has done everything from clearing weeds and planting trees at local parks and youth centers to bathing and walking dogs at the Northeast Arkansas Humane Society.""One of my most rewarding volunteer experiences was repainting and cleaning a family crisis center,"" she said.Story continuesIn September, Gist and her teammates grabbed their paintbrushes once again, this time sprucing up a 40-foot storage trailer for a nonprofit educational radio station.While Gist finds satisfaction in completing each unique project, the day represents much more to her.""Participating in the Day of Caring is a way for us to live out the Regions values in our communities,"" she said.

""I'm so thankful to work for a company that encourages us to make a difference in our community.""Following this year's Day of Caring in June, Newburn put away the yard tools and quickly moved on to his next project: being part of Regions' United Way East Texas associate giving campaign team. Each year, the group brings in United Way guest speakers to raise awareness about the work nonprofit partners do and how their donations make a difference.""The agencies we support focus on four key areas: education, financial stability, health and wellness, and crisis-intervention programs,"" he explained. ""Sometimes, it is easy to think, ‘I'm just one person, there's not much I can do.' However, whether you give money or your time, you can make a tremendous impact on your community.""Newburn and his teammates do more than just educate associates during the campaign.""Our goal is to make the United Way campaign kickoff fun,"" he added.This year, that excitement reached a higher pitch than ever with bragging rights on the line in addition to the usual donation perks of pizza lunches and jeans days.""This was the first year we've made it a competition between our Smith and Gregg County teams,"" Newburn said.

I love how generous our community is.""He's also grateful for the generosity of his Regions teammates.""There's a lot of people who made our campaign successful, Newburn said of this year's record-breaking donation total. ""Everyone is so giving.""Just like Newburn and Gist.Both say they've gained far more than they've contributed over the years through their United Way service.""Our United Way staff works so hard to make the lives of others better, I'm proud to be associated with them,"" Newburn added. ""It's heartwarming to see and rewarding to give back.""""I love the sense of community the United Way Day of Caring creates,"" Gist added.

Interest in bonds is increasing as Treasury yields rise. Aggressive rate hikes to control inflation have pushed the S&amp;P 500 into bear territory, and investor sentiment is quite pessimistic as the benchmark S&amp;P 500 has declined about 22% year-to-date as of October 22. According to Ned Davis Research, a rally in the stock market in 2023 will not be sustainable unless traders do not abandon their investments amid a bear market. NDR's proprietary trading sentiment composite suggests that the market is in ""extreme pessimism"" territory, with bearish responses nearing 60% of market participants. The research firm noted:""Sentiment would need to remain subdued, providing a wall of worry for the market to climb...A quick jump from pessimism to optimism would signal the rally may have run its course."" Investors seeking safe and solid positions for their portfolios can take a look at firms like Visa Inc.

Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Beta Value: 0.72Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a London-based energy and petrochemical company with operations in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas. The company runs through Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions segments. On October 21, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced that it had resumed export operations from the Forcados oil terminal in Nigeria after a 10-week halt. On October 13, JPMorgan analyst Christyan Malek reiterated an Overweight rating on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) but trimmed the price target on the stock to 2,900 GBp from 3,000 GBp.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 39 hedge funds were long Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), with combined stakes worth $3.46 billion, compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter worth $5.6 billion. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 20.25 million shares worth $1.06 billion. In addition to Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is one of the best low risk stocks to invest in. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”10. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Beta Value: 0.72Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American company engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and Taiwan.

The dividend is payable on November 10, to shareholders of the company as of October 28. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the best low risk stocks to invest in. On October 5, Baird analyst Peter Benedict reiterated an Outperform rating and a $575 price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) after the company's September sales data. Primary comps of 8.6% were below the earlier six-month average growth rate of 9.6%, but they ""remained healthy"", the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 64 hedge funds were bullish on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 4.3 million shares worth $2 billion. Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever that can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”9.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week’s 15% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 25%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lockheed Martin, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Lockheed Martin does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Lockheed Martin, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Lockheed Martin is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc. with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 6.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Lockheed Martin Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$76m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 23% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Lockheed Martin. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Lockheed Martin better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

265,d0c12534-a0f9-38cd-b7c9-534b3e450cba,VZ,2022-10-25,Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Will Want To Turn Around Its Return Trends,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-nyse-vz-want-120037611.html,1666699237,STORY,['VZ'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after investigating Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Verizon Communications, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.085 = US$27b ÷ (US$375b - US$53b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 8.5%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.1% average generated by the Telecom industry. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Verizon Communications compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Verizon Communications here  for free.So How Is Verizon Communications' ROCE Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Verizon Communications doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 8.5% from 13% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom Line On Verizon Communications' ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Verizon Communications' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Additionally, the stock's total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat, which isn't too surprising. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesVerizon Communications does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Verizon Communications  that you might be interested in.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to read about some more feminist stocks, go directly to 5 Best Feminist Stocks to Invest In.Gender parity initiatives at prominent companies that trade on stock markets in the United States have become all too common in the past few years. However, the impact that these initiatives are having on improving the gender pay gap is still debatable. According to data gathered by ExecuShe, a gender data company based in Sweden, women only own only about 1% of total shares in S&amp;P 500 companies, even though they account for nearly 25% of total top executives at these businesses. This is despite the fact that many of these firms, including giants like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), General Motor Company (NYSE:GM), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), have women in chief executive roles. According to Andreas Hoepner, a scientific adviser and professor of operational risk, banking, and finance at University College Dublin, this is because a lot of S&amp;P 500 firms are still run by their founders, none of whom are female. Hoepner also added that more women are in minor roles like HR Officers, which pay less than other top leadership jobs. These statistics are worrying in light of the fact that top executives at S&amp;P 500 firms were paid a median of $15.8 million in 2021. This represents an increase of more than 26% from 2020, according to a report by corporate leadership data provider Equilar. Some industries, per the report, are better at gender parity than others. These include household and personal products and pharmaceuticals. The energy and semiconductors firms, meanwhile, exhibit the largest gender disparities in the US economy. Our MethodologyThe prominent companies on the benchmark S&amp;P 500 that are led by women were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed.

Looking ahead, we expect Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) supply chain and SKU rationalization initiatives to continue to deliver margin expansion.

(NASDAQ:WBA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) progress.”  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Feminist Stocks to Invest In. Suggested Articles:12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In15 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In11 Best Income Stocks to Buy Right Now Disclosure.

273,6785c5e7-8383-3774-8ee3-da9b76c3032d,SWK,2022-10-25,Analysts Estimate Kennametal (KMT) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-kennametal-kmt-report-140002009.html,1666620002,STORY,['SWK'],"[Kennametal (KMT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis engineered products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.37 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.9%.Revenues are expected to be $488.09 million, up 1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11.61% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kennametal?For Kennametal, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.74%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kennametal will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Kennametal would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.53, delivering a surprise of +12.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Kennametal doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerStanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), another stock in the Zacks Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.73 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -73.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.12 billion, down 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been revised 5.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -3.45%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stanley Black &amp; Decker will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That number rises to 69% among businesses with $10MM plus annual revenue and 64% among those with 20 years or more of experience. Looking to the future, 48% believe training the next generation of trades professionals is one of the most critical needs for the success of the construction industry in 2023.Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9100752-dewalt-us-contractors-powering-the-future-survey-results/DEWALT® Powering the Future Infographic""The DEWALT Powering the Future Survey sheds further light on the wide-reaching gap in skilled labor and its continued impact on the residential and commercial construction industries. Add to that the overwhelming demand for trades expertise during the COVID-19 pandemic and the [skilled-labor] gap is quickly becoming the most critical need that will dictate the future success of the field,"" said Allison Nicolaidis, President, Power Tools Group, Stanley Black &amp; Decker. ""That's why DEWALT is committed to putting a heavier spotlight on these challenges and taking a lead role in supporting our industrial and construction partners to overcome them. DEWALT will further its commitment to closing the skills deficit with the launch of the DEWALT Trade Scholarship to support trades education programs for students across the country.""Story continuesInflation, Insufficient Skilled Labor, and Long Hours are Top ChallengesKeeping up with inflation (57%), finding skilled workers/being understaffed (51%) and working long hours (37%) are the top three most significant challenges that U.S. contractors surveyed are currently facing. When it comes to the effects those challenges are having on the industry, an overwhelming majority of contractors—93%—feel the lack of skilled workers has had at least a minor impact on their existing work.Half of those contractors who have had their work impacted by the labor shortage (50%) cite the primary causes for the gap as a lack of awareness around career paths in construction, followed by outside influences (parents, media, etc.) that guide younger people away from pursuing a career in the industry (47%), as well as an underestimation of how much money can be made in the industry (41%).Mentorship MattersA great deal of importance is placed on mentorship programs regardless of contractor level, tenure, or type, with 67% of all contractors labeling these programs as extremely important with an additional 24% identifying these programs as moderately important. A larger majority of contractors with extensive experience (20+ years) or high business revenue ($10MM or more) find these programs to be extremely important (71% and 78% respectively) in providing the latest training to help young professionals prepare for onsite work. In addition, more than half (53%) of contractors surveyed say mentorship increases excitement about construction as a career path.Health and Wellbeing are EssentialSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, contractors have experienced numerous changes in the industry. According to the survey, the number one takeaway (39%) from the pandemic among contractors is the importance of employee mental health and wellbeing.Most contractors (56%) have been working more hours since 2019, with mechanical (68%), plumbing (66%) and electrical (60%) contractors more likely to have seen an increase in labor hours since the pandemic began. Nearly 40% of all contractors surveyed say longer hours have made their jobs more difficult.2023 Forecast Half of contractors (48%) identify training the next generation of workers as one of the most critical industry focus areas in 2023 and beyond. Seasoned contractors are particularly committed to training the next generation of workers, with 63% of those in the industry for 20 or more years indicating this is a paramount goal for the future. The second and third most critical elements for growth are contingency planning/risk management and resilient supply chain solutions (both 37%).Also indicated as an important element of future success is the innovation of tools and equipment (33%). With tool advancements, 55% of contractors feel they have increased efficiency, half (51%) state they have increased user control, and over a third (36%) think it has improved the quality of work.Empowering Careers in Construction and the Trades As part of its commitment to empower the next generation of workers, DEWALT has opened the DEWALT Trades Scholarship, which will award students with a $5,000 grant in pursuance of a skilled trade educational program for the 2023-2024 academic year.

For more tech stock declines, go to 5 Biggest Tech Stock Drops in 2022. If there is one thing that can be said with certainty about the stock market right now, it's that the market is officially in bear mode. This means that all major stock indexes, and shares, have now entered a protracted period of share price drops. These drops have been caused by the macroeconomic environment, and they are the result of several factors. One factor is inflation, as rising prices have hit consumer purchasing power and forced them to concentrate most of their spending resources on essential items. For large companies, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), this means that the money consumers might have allocated for a smartphone or a personal computing purchase is simply not there.The other is the drastic increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which is estimated to hike the rate to 5% by May next year, according to the traders betting on the futures market. The current rate sits at 3.25% and the new bets suggest that at least one massive 75 basis point and two 50 basis point hikes are headed our way.Taking stock of the current situation for major stock indexes reveals that the picture is far from pretty. For instance, the NASDAQ Composite Index is down by 31% year to date, the S&amp;P 500 index is down by 22%, the DOW Jones Industrial Average by 15%, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by 18%.In this article we will focus on major tech stocks that fell sharply this year.

Here is what the fund said:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (+34.6%): After a punishing first half of the year when bearish investors came to believe that Netflix’s growth days were done for good, the company reported fewer subscriber losses than expected in the second quarter and guided for a return to at least modest subscriber growth in the third quarter. In addition, as more information about the company’s planned advertising supported subscription tier has become available, investors began to express growing confidence in this tool to revitalize growth in 2023.”13.

(NASDAQ:META) is down roughly 60%, and Carmax, Eurofins Scientific, Coherent and Ciena have lost about half their value. I’m wearing a dunce cap for Meta, as the changes Apple made to privacy tracking severely impacted Meta’s effectiveness at targeting ads to the right consumers. However, despite being compared recently to AOL by one analyst, Meta continues to capture enormous amounts of consumer attention: roughly 2.9 billion people use one of its sites every day. I believe it has a very long runway on monetizing those eyeballs, especially outside North America. For all its problems with ad tracking, and despite heavy investment in the so called metaverse, Meta should earn about $10 per share in 2022 and more next year. The stock, at $136 on September 30, reflects pessimism that Meta will ever recover. We’re holding because we think that Meta has the resources to improve its advertising efficiency, and that it eventually will.”6. Confluent, Inc.

CRL is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.09%. Earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.63%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe Research Models and Services (RMS) segment is likely to have gained from continued global demand for research models and associated services. The company’s ongoing initiatives to boost operating performances by HemaCare and Cellero are anticipated to have had a beneficial impact on the cell supply business.The ongoing broad-based demand and meaningful price increases in the Research Model business, particularly in North America,as well as for Global Research Models Services, particularly Insourcing Solutions and GEMSdriven by increased research activities in this geography are expected to have contributed to the top line in Q3. However, an adverse impact related to China's COVID restrictions through the months of Q3 are likely to have disrupted RMS revenues.Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCharles River Laboratories International, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCharles River Laboratories International, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. QuoteMeanwhile, the company’s CRADLE initiative for small and large biopharmaceutical clients is anticipated to have maintained its growth momentum, benefiting the in-sourcing solutions business within the RMS arm.The Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) arm is likely to have benefited from a strong biotechnology client base and robust backlog at the end of 2021.Within the DSA arm, the Safety Assessment business has been witnessing strong demand and price increases. The company expects growth in this business banking on strong business trends with higher pricing and increased demand within the Safety Assessment business.Story continuesFurther, amid the staffing shortage issue, Charles River expects recent hires to help the company meet the accelerating DSA growth outlook over the course of 2022. This should get reflected in the Q3 results itself.The Discovery business is likely to have gained from continued strong performances by early discovery and CNS services. Of late, Charles River has been witnessing growing client interest in integrated drug discovery programs. To meet the robust client demand for Discovery Services, the company has been closely managing staffing levels and introducing cutting-edge capabilities. The company has also been consistently expanding its discovery portfolio through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. We expect these ongoing business trends and initiatives to have fueled growth during the second quarter.The Manufacturing Support segment is likely to have been driven by revenue growth across the Microbial Solutions and Biologics Testing Solutions businesses. The company has been recording strong demand across its portfolio of critical quality control testing solutions within the Microbial Solutions business. Meanwhile, we anticipate the continued uptake of cell and gene therapy testing services for the Biologics Testing Solutions business to have driven revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $978.7 million, suggesting a 9.2% rise over the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $2.51 indicates a 7.0% drop from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

RICK, Iron Mountain IRM, McKesson Corp. MCK and National Fuel Gas Co. NFG5 Solid Dividend Growth Stocks for Q4Dividend investing is in vogue amid huge volatility and uncertainty. Persistently high inflation and Fed's aggressive rate hikes might push the economy into a recession and have been making investors jittery.In such a scenario, dividends are major sources of consistent income for investors though they do not offer dramatic price appreciation. These stocks can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and tend to outperform in a choppy market.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Boise Cascade, RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc., Iron Mountain , McKesson Corp. and National Fuel Gas Co. — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Dividend Growth: A Winning StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 18 stocks that fit the bill:Idaho-based Boise Cascade operates as a wood products manufacturer and building materials distributor. It has seen a solid earnings estimate revision of 42 cents for this year over the past month and has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.97%.Boise Cascade has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.

ZBH is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.82 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.66%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the consensus estimate on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 7.4%. Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayZimmer Biomet is expected to have witnessed a recovery in its legacy business in the third quarter, primarily driven by the continued opening up of the economy. Over the third-quarter months, it was observed that people kept opting for non-COVID elective orthopedic and musculoskeletal procedures.However, the company might have faced upheaval in business, thanks to the global inflationary situation in terms of mounting labor and raw material costs, severe staffing shortages and supply issues, which might have impacted ZBH’s bottom line in the third quarter.Further, Zimmer Biomet, which has a broad business base in China, is expected to have come under pressure due to the lingering COVID-led lockdowns and limited trade. Further, the implementation of the volume-based procurement program brought down China orthopedic device prices, which might have otherwise impacted ZBH’s business in this region.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteOn a positive note, priority areas like the S.E.T. business (comprising Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) are expected to have put up a better third-quarter performance compared with 2021, fueled by ramped-up investment in R&amp;D and commercial infrastructure.We expect this arm to deliver strong results on the back of the company’s focus on sports and extremities, especially upper extremities, trauma and Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic. Zimmer Biomet is likely to have gained from the September launch of the Identity shoulder system in the United States. This might have partially contributed to the company’s Q3 revenues.Story continuesWe expect the company to have witnessed strength in its performances within its Hips and Knees product portfolios in the United States. Apart from a strong recovery in elective procedures, easy comparisons outside the United States, along with strong knee procedure recovery across most regions, continued global traction for the Persona knee system, especially with Persona Revision in the United States, and ROSA penetration and pull-through are expected to have contributed to the company’s Hipsand Knees business.The strong performance of Avenir Complete is likely to have continued during the third quarter, thus driving the Hip business. In this regard, the company earlier this year noted that one of the fastest-growing subcategories of hip is the direct anterior approach. Both the recently-launched Avenir Complete and ROSA applications target that fast-growth submarket.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.63 billion, suggesting a 15.2% drop from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.56 indicates a 13.8% decline from the year-ago adjusted earnings.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates. This is not the case here as you can see:Earnings ESP: Zimmer Biomet has an Earnings ESP of -0.59%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.We note that the third-quarter estimates are showing a sharp year-over-year decline.

Earlier this year, the company purchased more than 530,000 square feet (50,000 square meters) of land in the industrial area of Guadalajara, Castilla-La Mancha, where it is now preparing to begin construction.""We're excited to be a part of Guadalajara and put down our roots in Spain,"" said Amy Davis, Vice President and President of New Power at Cummins. ""The growing hydrogen economy here continues to be an attractive environment for Cummins to increase its global electrolyzer manufacturing footprint.""With the support of the Spanish government and European Union, Spain's hydrogen market has great potential,"" she added. ""This facility will poise Cummins to help European customers transition their energy supply and meet ambitious sustainability goals. This plant is also another step toward achieving Cummins' own carbon neutrality targets.""Construction of the new PEM electrolyzer plant is anticipated to be complete at the end of 2023. It will initially create approximately 150 high-skill jobs, with the potential to add another 200 jobs as production grows. The more than 200,000 square foot (20,000 square meters) facility will include system assembly and testing and have the capacity to produce 500MW of electrolyzers per year, scalable to more than 1GW per year.Cummins' investment in Spain adds to the company's global efforts to scale development and manufacturing of zero-emissions technologies and ultimately reduce carbon emissions. The company also recently announced the expansion of PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capacity at its Oevel, Belgium, factory to 1GW.Story continues""Green"" hydrogen - produced through water electrolysis using renewable electricity - is a key enabler to economy-wide decarbonization. Once produced, hydrogen can be stored as a liquid or a gas and transported. As an alternative to fossil fuels, hydrogen is a viable zero-emissions solution for some of the world's most energy intensive and hardest-to-abate sectors, such as heavy-duty commercial transportation, manufacturing, industrial processes and chemical production.""By increasing our ability to meet demand for hydrogen generation technology, this facility will help accelerate the global clean energy transition and the role of hydrogen as a viable alternative energy source in Europe,"" said Alexey Ustinov, Vice President of Electrolyzers at Cummins. ""Cummins is committed to helping the European Union produce more hydrogen domestically, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and securing a sustainable future.""Cummins has a long history of advanced technology and engineering capabilities and innovates across a broad portfolio of market-leading renewable hydrogen technologies.The company has been part of many of the world's hydrogen ""firsts,"" including powering the world's largest PEM electrolyzer in operation at 20MW in Bécancour, Canada; the world's first megawatt-scale demonstration plant for storing wind energy in the natural gas grid in Windgas Falkenhagen, Germany; the world's first 100% hydrogen-powered passenger train fleet in Lower Saxony, Germany; and the world's first hydrogen refueling station for ships, cars, trucks and industrial customers in Antwerp, Belgium.ENDView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: http://cummins.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/721827/Cummins-Moves-Forward-on-Spanish-Plant-Making-Technology-Key-to-Green-Hydrogen-Production]"

Visitors must make a reservation to visit one of its four parks in Florida, and when those reservations are filled, no new visitors are allowed entry.The pass holders claim that violates Disney’s promise that premium annual pass holders have unlimited access to the parks.“Disney appears to be limiting the number of reservations available to Platinum Pass holders and Platinum Plus Pass holders on any given day in order to maximize the number of single-day and other passes that Disney can sell,” the suit alleges.The Platinum and Platinum Plus pass-holder tiers have been retired by Disney for months. Last fall, the company reworked its pass program and increased the number of reservations pass holders can make. The company told the Orlando Sentinel the lawsuit “mischaracterizes the program and its history, and we will respond further in court.”A similar lawsuit in California is moving forward, following a judge’s ruling in May.Despite some user complaints that the company is nickel-and-diming them and widespread unhappiness over having to pay for features that used to be free (such as quick access to rides), park attendance at Orlando’s Walt Disney World and California’s Disneyland has been strong.

In the wake of increasingly sophisticated and record-setting DDoS attacks worldwide, the move further enables Akamai Prolexic to defend customers from the largest, multi-terabit attacks and provide better performance and reliability for online businesses of any size, anywhere on the planet.New and additional globally distributed scrubbing centers analyze incoming traffic, identify threats and remove malicious activities to prevent downtime for end users or networks. The centers are fully software-defined and facilitate rapid deployments for capacity extension, better regional coverage and improved redundancy.The initial rollout commences in Q3 2022 and continues in 2023 with additional centers being deployed in all major regions, including North America (US-East/West, Canada), Europe (Italy, Spain, Switzerland), Asia (India, Japan, Hong Kong), and the Middle East.DDoS threats are evolving rapidly, subjecting businesses without the proper defenses to considerable risk. Since 2020, organizations have experienced a deluge of DDoS extortion, high-profile, multi-terabit attacks, hacktivism, and an explosion of novel threats.Security teams are also under immense pressure to defend against a booming arsenal of increasingly sophisticated attacks. In 2010, the top five DDoS attack vectors represented 90% of all attacks, whereas today's top five accounted for a mere 55%.""DDoS attacks are innovating at an unprecedented rate, but our customers can rest assured that Akamai's DDoS defense evolves even faster and will always be many steps ahead of the latest threats,"" said Akamai's Senior Vice President and General Manager of Infrastructure Security, Sean Lyons. ""This platform advancement drastically accelerates our time to market and will enable us to deliver new cybersecurity innovations with greater frequency. In addition, our extension of defense capacity, regional presence and next generation scrubbing centers further strengthens our ability to mitigate all types and volumes of attacks. And by bringing DDoS protection even closer to our customers, they know they can rely on Akamai to deliver unmatched security without impacting latency and end user experience.""Story continuesAkamai Prolexic stops attacks with a cloud-based DDoS scrubbing platform to protect applications wherever they are deployed, whether in a data center, the public cloud, or a colocation facility. It provides comprehensive protection against the broadest range of DDoS attack types and defends against high-bandwidth sustained attacks, as well as today's complex multi-vector attacks that jump from application to application. Prolexic includes proactive mitigation controls tailored to network traffic to stop attacks instantly, backed by active mitigation performed by Akamai's 24/7 global SOCC, and provides customers a unique 100% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA).*Dedicated defense capacity represents the resources available for consuming and stopping attacks, and is a better indicator of DDoS mitigation capabilities than total network capacity, which also accounts for traffic delivery and utilization.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

ESG-focused investors have become an increasingly influential force for change that most companies can no longer ignore. In fact, a 2022 MSCI report states that, ""ESG investing has become a prevailing part of investing,"" and predicts that the trend will only grow stronger. But companies also face increasing regulatory scrutiny of ESG issues as well as legal risks, according to Business Law Today. Yet, with more reasons than ever to improve ESG disclosures, even well-motivated companies may not make full use of a basic tool for telling their ESG stories to their most active and engaged investors: the proxy statement. Fortunately, following a few fundamental principles can help companies integrate ESG factors into proxy statements and make a positive contribution to investor engagement.What is a Proxy Statement?Public companies in the U.S. are required to file a proxy statement with the SEC and distribute it to all shareholders prior to the company's annual meeting (or certain special shareholder meetings). The statement provides relevant information about matters that will be addressed and voted on at such meetings, which investors need to make informed decisions when they vote on proposals and board elections. Proxy statements typically include information about the board of directors, executive compensation, shareholder proposals, management statements on specific matters or policies and proposals to add or remove members from the board.Voting gives shareholders a say in how a company is run, but investors also have the option of assigning their voting rights to someone else to act on their behalf, a practice called proxy voting. Some institutional investors exercise voting rights on behalf of their investors, which can give these large institutions a significant influence. For ESG issues, proxy voting and institutional investors have become increasingly important, with activist investors attempting to change company policies, elect their preferred directors to the board or remove directors they oppose.Story continuesFor all these reasons, the proxy statement is playing a more important role in corporate governance and can be a valuable tool for communicating ESG program highlights and initiatives. Not only can an effective ESG strategy mitigate potential risks, but it can contribute to achieving positive outcomes, as pointed out by Jim Cleary, executive vice president and chief financial officer for global healthcare company AmerisourceBergen. ""There are also indirect benefits from ESG initiatives,"" he said in a recent interview for Nasdaq's ESG Trendsetters series. ""Examples include being a more resilient business by being able to adapt to extreme weather events, becoming an employer of choice, winning long-term shareholders and lowering the cost of capital.""So how can companies communicate their ESG practices using the proxy statement as a disclosure medium? One good place to start is by learning from companies that provide good examples.Proxy Statement ExamplesSome well-known companies have been leading the way for years, using proxy statements to highlight their ESG policies and how their principles align with business objectives. Among Fortune 50 companies, according to an analysis published by the Harvard Law School Forum for Corporate Governance, most already include information about a variety of ESG factors in their proxy statements, and the rate rises above 90% of companies for some topics.Fortunately, support is available to help companies find the best way forward. Over the last decade, Nasdaq has developed a comprehensive suite of ESG solutions to help client companies achieve their objectives. The ESG Advisory Program leverages Nasdaq's extensive in-house expertise, bringing together data, insights and a team of analysts to help clients prioritize and guide their ESG efforts.While many solutions need to be tailored to the specific needs of a company, there are three general principles that should guide ESG disclosures in proxy statements, as recommended by the Harvard Law School Forum for Corporate Governance.First, companies should identify a peer group of comparable companies and evaluate ESG trends and standards among them.However, this principle needs to be interpreted for different situations. For example, Facebook's peer group includes not only the most obvious names, such as Alphabet and Amazon, but also companies that might not normally be considered similar, such as Disney, Verizon, Comcast and Uber. A diverse peer group makes sense for Facebook because its multifaceted business model touches a variety of sectors. Apple defines a primary peer group of mostly tech companies and a secondary peer group that includes Nike and Coca-Cola, among others.Second, one may look to relevant industry practices to evaluate whether the company can work to incorporate ESG disclosures into their proxy statements consistent with their peers.If a different approach is chosen, the reason behind the decision should be explained. This can be an opportunity to highlight positive differences. For example, while many companies assign board oversight of ESG policies to traditional committees that already have other roles, Coca-Cola has a dedicated ESG and Public Policy Committee to focus on the relevant issues. The committee is highlighted in the proxy statement and its responsibilities are described.Third, a company should make sure that all reported ESG metrics and data are accurate.Establishing a clearly defined oversight role for the board on ESG matters may help with accountability, but reporting is a specialized area that may require outside expertise and support, not only for external stakeholders but for internal processes as well. For example, Nasdaq OneReport simplifies the process of ESG data capture, engagement, oversight and disclosure. In addition, Metrio, a leading provider of end-to-end ESG analytics and reporting services, was recently acquired by Nasdaq to improve support for client companies.Many companies adopt established reporting frameworks, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards or Global Reporting Initiative Standards, which provide guidance and offer industry-specific metrics and comparability. Global medical device company Medtronic adopted SASB standards in 2015 because the focus on financially material ESG metrics could inform the internal decision-making process and help them communicate relevant data to external stakeholders.""It's about understanding the risks identified and who owns them, so we can start having conversations with the right stakeholders,"" explained Ginny Cassidy, director of the company's enterprise sustainability program.What to do and not to do when including ESG in Proxy StatementsStudying other companies can be instructive, but if the wide variety of practices makes it difficult to identify clear principles, another good place to start is with a simple list of do's and don'ts, as suggested by international law firm Perkins Coie. On the positive side, a company should do the following:Explicitly define ESG prioritiesMake sure ESG metrics are material and appropriate for a proxy statementCompare the draft proxy statement with peer-group companies that are considered ESG leadersIdentify reporting standards or frameworks that are being used for the statementBut even if these four things are done well, companies also need to make sure that they avoid basic missteps or unforced errors. Reiterating the complete corporate responsibility report or ESG report would be a mistake because these documents often contain information that is not material for investors. Including metrics that have not been thoroughly validated would be an error, as any inaccurate information could raise questions about credibility. Finally, another misstep would be to make grand promises but fail to follow through and deliver. After all, ESG investors generally want information about measurable and actionable programs.How Can ESG Contribute to Proxy Voting?A recent regulatory change highlights the growing importance of ESG issues for proxy voting. In 2021, the US Department of Labor (DOL) amended its rules for ERISA-covered retirement plans on investment selection and specifically addressed including ESG issues in the investment process. The bottom line is that when these plans exercise shareholder rights and vote proxies, they now can include ESG factors as material considerations in their risk-return analysis.Regardless of regulatory factors, ESG issues have played an increasingly important role in proxy voting over the past couple of years, and shareholder proposals focused on ESG factors are becoming more frequent, a trend that is expected to continue. According to a recent Institutional Investor report, some pension funds are taking a more active stance on voting proxies in line with their own ESG policies.Other institutional investors, ranging from high-profile asset managers (such as UBS and Fidelity) to insurance companies, are also focusing more on ESG issues in their proxy-voting policies.Individual investors typically do not own enough shares to have much direct impact, but when many individual investors share the same priorities (or can express them through like-minded proxies with more influence) their voice can be heard. Companies face mounting pressure to address ESG issues primarily because a growing number of all types of investors large and small are making these concerns a priority in their investment decisions. As a result, companies that want to avoid falling behind industry peers may want to be proactive about addressing ESG factors in their proxy statements.Nasdaq, Inc., Monday, October 24, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722010/The-Impact-of-ESG-on-Proxy-Season-and-Proxy-Voting]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of European dividend stocks and their returns, and go directly to read 5 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. After a pandemic-related slump in global dividend payments, companies around the world raised and reinstated their dividends to a record level. Dividends in Europe and the US fell by $100 billion in 2020 but recovered as soon as the market regained its footing last year. This year’s returns of European dividend stocks show their superior performance to their counterparts. The AlphaDEX European Dividend Index, which tracks the performance of Europe-domiciled dividend companies, reported a decline of 18.5% in 2022 so far, versus a 21.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of October 21.In its second quarter 2022 global dividend report, Janus Henderson Investors mentioned that the UK and Europe were the main driving forces in the global payout surge. Dividends in Europe grew by 28.7% on an underlying basis, amounting to $165.8 billion. The report also mentioned that special dividends paid by European companies also grew by 2.5% in Q2, from the previous quarter. Another report by Forbes cited the data of Henderson International Income Trust, which mentioned that dividends from UK companies will head for record payments this year for the first time since 2008. This growth will be attributed to rising oil prices that have significantly contributed to the growing revenues of many companies in the FTSE 100. With the global surge in dividend stocks this year, companies like Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) are gaining ground among investors due to their solid dividend policies.According to analysts, Europe’s recovering stock market has a lot to offer to investors in terms of dividends and capital gains. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs analyst Guillaume Jaisson spoke to Bloomberg about European dividend equities. He said that high-yielding stocks in Europe have started to outperform as they are less sensitive to rising bond yields. He further mentioned that dividends in Stoxx Europe 600 Index are expected to grow by 10% this year, mainly driven by energy and bank stocks.Story continues10 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: samranwara31 / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are European businesses that pay dividends to shareholders.

Here is what the firm has to say:“ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”9.

Here is what the firm has to say:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multi-national companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Video Conferencing Stocks To Invest In10 Cheap Value Stocks To Buy12 Small Cap Ecommerce Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

JNPR is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 25, after the market closes. In the last reported quarter, the company missed adjusted earnings by 3 cents. The Sunnyvale, CA-based network solutions provider is expected to have recorded year-over-year higher revenues, driven by healthy demand trends.Factors at PlayIn the to-be-reported quarter, Juniper is expected to have benefited from the launch of Network as a Service (NaaS) enhancements to its leading AIOps platform that facilitate the deployment and management of wired, wireless and secure SD-WAN network services via Juniper MSP and reseller partners. The combination of microservices cloud, open APIs and Mist AI with new NaaS capabilities is likely to bring more flexibility, agility and insight to Juniper partners. This is likely to be reflected in the upcoming results.During the quarter, the company inked an agreement with Tata Play Fiber for an undisclosed amount to augment the latter’s network capabilities to cater to the exponential growth in customers and related data demands. The improvement in infrastructure facilities is expected to reduce the complexity of the network while increasing operational flexibility and efficiency with a better economy of scale. In addition, Tata Play Fiber is likely to leverage Juniper's Broadband Network Gateway subscriber management solution to simplify the delivery of bundled services. This is likely to have generated incremental revenues in the quarter.The company was also selected to facilitate the digital transformation initiative of the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New South Wales (“RSPCA NSW”). Juniper’s AI-driven wired and wireless portfolio, which includes the deployment of a range of networking solutions, has enabled RSPCA NSW to provide a strong digital experience for its prospective pet parents and staff.

First, we initiated small positions in U.S. natural gas producers Chesapeake (NYSE:CHK).Given its superior environmental profile compared to other fossil fuels, we have long favored natural gas in our energy holdings. Combustion of natural gas releases 50% less CO2 than coal, 25% less CO2 than gasoline and dramatically less particulate and pollution, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. With the advances in shale production this century, the U.S. has become a natural gas powerhouse with some of the lowest-cost and largest reserves in the world. But because natural gas is difficult to ship across the ocean (it must be liquefied, which requires expensive infrastructure on both ends of the voyage), America’s gas bounty has ironically proved a burden for U.S. producers.""

Recently, URI crossed above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.A well-liked tool among traders, the 20-day simple moving average offers a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. This is very beneficial to short-term traders, as it smooths out short-term price trends and gives more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.Shares of URI have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 8.1%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, suggesting that URI could be poised for a continued surge.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account URI's positive earnings estimate revisions.

It may not have been easy to hold on to URI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?United Rentals' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at United Rentals' main business drivers.Headquartered in Stamford, CT, United Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of 1,390 rental locations in United States, Canada and Europe. Moreover, it operates in 49 states and every Canadian province. The company offers 4,400 classes of equipment for rent at a total original equipment cost (“OEC”) of $16.6 billion (as of June 2022).The company’s customer base includes construction and industrial companies, utilities, municipalities, government agencies, independent contractors and homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations. The company’s principal products and services are equipment rental, sale of rental equipment, new equipment, contractor supplies, services and other.United Rentals serves customers as a single-source solution, provided through two business segments: General Rentals and Specialty or Trench, Power and Fluid Solutions.General Rentals (accounted for 75.7% of total revenues in 2021) includes the rental of construction, aerial and industrial equipment, general tools and light equipment, along with related services and activities. The segment includes the rental of the following: i) general construction and industrial equipment ii) aerial work platforms and iii) general tools and light equipment. The general rentals segment caters to 11 geographic regions — Carolinas, Gulf South, Industrial (which serves the geographic Gulf region and has a strong industrial presence), Mid-Atlantic, Mid Central, Midwest, Northeast, Pacific West, South, Southeast and Western Canada — and operates throughout the United States and Canada.Story continuesSpecialty (24.3%) includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services like trench safety equipment, power and HVAC equipment, and fluid solutions equipment.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in United Rentals a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $7,378.95, or a gain of 637.90%, as of October 24, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 161.85% and the price of gold went up -6.50% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for URI.Shares of United Rentals have outperformed the industry so far this year. The company is benefiting from the U.S. administration’s increased focus on infrastructural improvement. This leading equipment rental company has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals. Better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in non-residential construction and industrial verticals, higher total and rental revenues and stronger pricing aided the company’s second-quarter 2022 results. During the period, rental revenues grew 26.2% from a year ago. Adjusted gross margin expanded 360 basis points (bps). However, unprecedented supply-chain disruptions continues to be a headwind.Shares have gained 8.09% over the past four weeks and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower.

According to Andreas Hoepner, a scientific adviser and professor of operational risk, banking, and finance at University College Dublin, this is because a lot of S&amp;P 500 firms are still run by their founders, none of whom are female. Hoepner also added that more women are in minor roles like HR Officers, which pay less than other top leadership jobs. These statistics are worrying in light of the fact that top executives at S&amp;P 500 firms were paid a median of $15.8 million in 2021. This represents an increase of more than 26% from 2020, according to a report by corporate leadership data provider Equilar. Some industries, per the report, are better at gender parity than others. These include household and personal products and pharmaceuticals. The energy and semiconductors firms, meanwhile, exhibit the largest gender disparities in the US economy. Our MethodologyThe prominent companies on the benchmark S&amp;P 500 that are led by women were selected for the list.

We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Executives have said the $28.3 billion acquisition of digital medical records provider Cerner Corp. will build inroads in the health care industry, which has been comparatively slow to adopt cloud technology.“That’s an organic number -- that’s assuming what we own now,” Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said of the sales projection. “Honestly, it’s not that aggressive a number because of our growth rates.”Oracle’s foreast came during its first financial analyst meeting since before the pandemic, held during its annual user conference in Las Vegas. Doug Kehring, Oracle executive vice president, said the company also projects operating margin of 45%, including Cerner, by 2026.Oracle’s fiscal 2026 target is “some $4 billion above consensus and implies annual growth of about 11%, which we see as an encouraging sign given rising recession risks,” said Anurag Rana, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “Moreover, management envisions reaching this target with 45% operating margin, which is noteworthy given near-term pressure on profitability due to Cerner and a changing revenue mix toward cloud.”Ahead of the event, Piper Sandler Analyst Brent Bracelin wrote that Oracle’s cloud adoption looks “better than feared,” though currency will continue to be a drag on short term growth. In its most-recent quarter, Oracle sales jumped 18% to $11.4 billion, juiced by the integration of Cerner. Analysts, on average, project Oracle will generate $49.6 billion in sales by the end of the fiscal year in May 2023, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesShares jumped as much as 5.5% after closing Wednesday at 66.30.

In addition to this, these stocks also offer above-average dividend yields to shareholders with constant dividend streams. REITs have seen tremendous growth over the past few decades in the US and currently hold a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, according to a report by Global X. The report also mentioned that REITs make up 9% of the total commercial property market which is collectively worth over $20 trillion.REITs were badly hit during the pandemic due to construction delays and reduced operating income. However, the sector gained a foothold next year, delivering strong returns to shareholders. According to a report by Nareit, REITs returned 29% in 2021 through December 1. Another report by the same association mentioned that the FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index has outperformed the broader market in 15 of the past 25 years.Historically, REITs have performed well in periods of high inflation. This performance was attributed to rental contracts and a steady rise in construction projects. Global X referred to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which showed that REITs outperformed global equities from February 28 2005 to July 31, 2022. As mentioned above, high dividends make REITs one of the most reliable investment options. Especially in inflationary periods, their dividends are rewarding for shareholders because of high yields.

(NASDAQ:TROW) institutional investors after losing 49% over the previous year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-week-t-rowe-price-155223570.html,1666626743,STORY,['TROW'],"[A look at the shareholders of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 77% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$950m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 49% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of T. Rowe Price Group, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for T. Rowe Price Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About T. Rowe Price Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.T. Rowe Price Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at T. Rowe Price Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in T. Rowe Price Group. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 5.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of T. Rowe Price GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can report that insiders do own shares in T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.. Insiders own US$473m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over T. Rowe Price Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand T. Rowe Price Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for T.

Rowe Price 401(k) recordkeeping platform, target date investors continued to steadfastly adhere to a long-term focus and stay the course during market downturns.NEWSAmong participants on the T. Rowe Price 401(k) recordkeeping platform holding their entire balances in a target date strategy, only 0.2 percent of investors with all of their assets in target dates made any changes to their asset allocation in the rocky second quarter of this year.  That compares with 6.4 percent making changes among those not holding any target date strategies, or 32-times the rate of target date investors.This behavior is consistent with past market crises.  For example, in the first quarter of 2020 amid the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, only 1.5 % of T. Rowe Price 401(k) recordkeeping participants with their entire balances in a target date portfolio made any investment changes, versus 9.2% of those with no target dates in their accounts.Industrywide, target date solutions have become a mainstay investment for investors saving for retirement by offering globally diversified, professionally managed portfolios that gradually migrate from an equity-heavy allocation early in an investor's time horizon to a more balanced portfolio of equities and bonds. The share of the 401(k) market invested in these portfolios quadrupled to 31% in 2019 versus 8% in 2007, according to the Investment Company Institute.Over the last two decades, target date strategies can stake a claim as one of the most important financial innovations in history.  Since the 2006 federal Pension Protection Act established target date portfolios as a qualified default option in retirement plans, they have become one of the most popular investment options in 401(k) plans.  For example, the number of 401(k) plan participants owning target date strategies has grown from 26% in 2007 to 60% as of the end of 2019, according to the latest figures from the Investment Company Institute.Story continuesThe four original T. Rowe Price Retirement Funds reached their 20th anniversary on September 30, 2022. The T. Rowe Price target date suite, which now includes more than 100 mutual funds, collective investment trusts, and other investments with $311 billion in assets as of September 30, pioneered a path to higher exposure to equities throughout an investing lifespan to seek to ensure that retirees did not outlive their assets.  It was radical idea at a time when plan sponsors regularly defaulted participants into short-term money market and stable value funds.  Now, more than 80% of participants on the T. Rowe Price 401(k) recordkeeping platform are partly or entirely invested in target date strategies.Over the last 20 years, the T. Rowe Price suite of target date solutions has been built on a foundation of deep research into investor behavior and life-cycle investing, a growing conviction that longevity risk was the biggest challenge facing retirees, and the recognition that target date strategies needed to evolve to better meet the challenges facing retirement investors.""The 401(k) industry looked very different 20 years ago,"" remembers Jerome Clark, the first portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price target date strategies from 2002 to 2020. ""The vast majority of plan sponsors used money market and stable value funds as their main default, not an ideal choice for a long-term investment horizon.  Many plan participants needed a more sensible, diversified mix of equities and bonds, professionally managed and rebalanced over time, that put them on a better path for retirement.  That's the gap we aimed to fill.""Morningstar, in naming Mr. Clark the outstanding portfolio manager of 2020 in their annual awards for investing excellence, called him, ""a pioneer of target date investing,"" saying that ""the T. Rowe Price retirement series stood out from the crowd from the start with a more aggressive equity glide path than most peers, which has influenced its long-term success.""  Mr. Clark will retire from T. Rowe Price at the end of this year.Each of the four original target date products, the T. Rowe Price Retirement 2010, 2020, 2030, and 2040 Funds, outperformed their respective S&amp;P Target Date benchmark indices, after fees, for the 3-, 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year periods ended September 30, 2022.  Over the full 20-year period, the funds grew an initial $100,000 investment to a range of $346,964 to $507,133, after fees.  The excess account balances delivered over their respective target date index benchmarks ranged from $66,887 to $86,047.The structure of target date portfolios may have benefited investors by turning widespread investor inertia to their favor, by encouraging them to stay invested rather than trading in and out of the portfolios.""We observed very early on that investors who constructed their own portfolios moved money around at a much more frequent rate than those who delegated their investments to professional money managers, which tended to negatively impact their returns,"" said Wyatt Lee, the head of Target Date Strategies since 2019 and lead portfolio manager of the target date suite.  ""Before the advent of target date funds, investors tended to either flee to safety during equity market downturns or to chase performance in robust markets. By helping to mitigate volatility during market turbulence due to their mix of equity and fixed income investments, target date portfolios became an important factor in helping investors weather the inevitable storms and maintain a long-term investment plan.""Mr. Lee joined T. Rowe Price in 1999 and became a co-portfolio on target date portfolios with Mr. Clark in 2013.  He was nominated by Morningstar as a Rising Talent in their 2020 annual awards for investing excellence.The target date products allow for age-appropriate selection of a target retirement date, whereupon the investment managers allocate their clients' assets along a glide path that shifts gradually over time from a relatively more robust allocation to equities early in their investing horizon, when their accounts have sufficient time to recover from market downturns to a more balanced mix of equities and fixed income investments through retirement, to age 95.  T. Rowe Price pioneered the now widely accepted notion that investors need to maintain sufficient equity allocations even after retirement to help sustain their nest eggs over longer lifespans and to outpace inflation.Performance data quoted represents past performance and is not a reliable indicator of future performance.

View standardized returns and other information about the T. Rowe Price target date funds.The T. Rowe Price target date solutions have evolved over time to better meet the changing needs of clients.  The innovations over the years included the first target date series to recognize the need for dynamic asset allocation over a potentially 30-year retirement span and an inflation-focused portfolio, introduced at a time when inflation was low but not likely to remain so.  Subsequent innovations included a blend series combining active and passively managed portfolios for more fee-conscious investors and a Target series with a lower-equity glide path for more conservative investors seeking to temper volatility around their retirement date while still pursuing adequate income during retirement.""From the beginning, our target date portfolios have been built and expanded upon with client interests in mind,"" said Sébastien Page, head of Global Multi-Asset, the division that manages target date portfolios, and chief investment officer.  ""These strategies bring together the best of T. Rowe Price underlying strategies, overlayed by deep life cycle investing research, strategic and tactical asset allocation, and reasonable fees.  They have stood the test of time.""TARGET DATE FACTS AND FIGUREST.

For more information, visit troweprice.com, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, or Facebook.Important InformationThe principal value of the target date strategies is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate date when investors plan to retire (assumed to be age 65). These target date strategies invest in a diversified portfolio of other T. Rowe Price stock and bond strategies and, at times, derivatives that represent various asset classes and sectors and are therefore subject to the risks of different areas of the market. The allocations of the target date strategies among these underlying investments will change over time to reflect the changing emphasis from capital appreciation to income and less volatility as investors approach and enter retirement. The target date strategies are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. Derivatives may be riskier or more volatile than other types of investments because they are generally more sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions.Some strategies mentioned are available only to certain retirement plans and may not be available to all investors.Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.Morningstar Awards 2020©.

Rowe Price (TROW) in Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-t-rowe-price-120412697.html,1666613052,STORY,"['TROW', 'ARES']","[T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results before the opening bell on Oct 27. TROW’s earnings and revenues are projected to decline from the year-ago reported figures.In the last reported quarter, T. Rowe Price’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on lower assets under management (AUM) and net revenues, as well as rising expenses.T. Rowe Price’s earnings outpaced estimates in one of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark in the other three, the average negative surprise being 5.78%.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseT. Rowe Price Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteTROW’s activities in the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 for third-quarter earnings has moved 6.6% south over the past week. Moreover, it indicates a decline of 44% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 billion for revenues suggests a 21% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Key Factors to NoteIn the third quarter, the S&amp;P 500 Index declined 5% sequentially, indicating unfavorable equity markets. Fixed-income markets too saw notable negative performances, with the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index recording a decline of 4% in the quarter.Hence, the third-quarter performances of asset managers are expected to have been affected by transitory challenges in the industry like declining markets, the shift away from growth, and uninspiring performances in certain U.S. equity strategies. Also, the swift decline in global markets, which depressed net flows across the industry in the first half of 2022, is expected to have continued in the third quarter as well.TROW too has not been immune to these challenges, as evident in its net flows, which have turned negative this year.Moreover, secular trends like market share tilt from active to passive; open-ended mutual funds to exchange traded funds, collective investment trusts, and SMAs; and public markets to private are expected to have affected the company’s quarterly performance.Story continuesAmid the challenging developments, T. Rowe Price is likely to have continued recording net outflows in the third quarter of 2022. The preliminary AUM of $1.23 trillion as of Sep 30, 2022, indicates a decline of 6.1% from $1.31 trillion as of Jun 30, 2022.Such a decline in AUM, owing to market fluctuations and foreign exchange translations, is expected to have affected TROW’s investment management business. The consensus estimate for investment advisory fees of $1.41 billion indicates a fall of 5.8% from the previous quarter’s reported figure.The unfavorable mix of AUM is expected to have reduced average fees in the quarter.Also, the consensus estimate for administrative, distribution and servicing fees of $138 million indicates a fall of 3.5% from the previous quarter’s reported figure.Coming to expenses,T. Rowe Price is expected to have incurred higher employee expenses due to rising salaries on account of inflation. The company’s initiatives to attract investment advisory clients and additional investments from its existing clients are expected to have led to significant expenditure. Thus, overall expenses are expected to have risen in the quarter under review, impeding bottom-line growth.Earnings WhispersThe proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for T.

Forward-looking statements may relate to our intent, belief, forecasts of, or current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects, future results, or future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made and the future, by its very nature, cannot be predicted with certainty.Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties, include, but are not limited to the impact of: continued uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, financial performance and liquidity, our customers and suppliers, and on the global economy; changes in general economic conditions, in the U.S. or internationally; industry evolution and significant competition; changes in our relationships with our significant customers; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; increased or more complex physical or data security requirements, or any data security breach; strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees; results of negotiations and ratifications of labor contracts; our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation; disruptions to our information technology infrastructure; global climate change; interruptions in or impacts on our business from natural or man-made events or disasters including terrorist attacks, epidemics or pandemics; exposure to changing economic, political and social developments in international markets; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures or strategic alliances; changing prices of energy, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, or interruptions in supplies of these commodities; changes in exchange rates or interest rates; our ability to accurately forecast our future capital investment needs; significant expenses and funding obligations relating to employee health, retiree health and/or pension benefits; our ability to manage insurance and claims expenses; changes in business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions that may result in impairments of our assets; potential additional U.S. or international tax liabilities; increasingly stringent laws and regulations, including relating to climate change; potential claims or litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters; and other risks discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, and subsequently filed reports. You should consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of predictions contained in such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements.Information, including comparisons to prior periods, may reflect adjusted results. See the appendix for reconciliations of adjusted results and other non-GAAP financial measures.Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresFrom time to time we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include: ""adjusted"" compensation and benefits; operating expenses; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”); operating profit; operating margin; other income and (expense); income before income taxes; income tax expense; effective tax rate; net income; and earnings per share. We present revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit on a constant currency basis. Additionally, we disclose free cash flow, adjusted return on invested capital (“ROIC”) and the ratio of adjusted total debt to adjusted EBITDA.We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in more fully understanding our financial results and cash flows and assessing our ongoing performance, because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operations and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. These non-GAAP measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis, business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations.Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our adjusted financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our adjusted financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled information reported by other companies.Transformation and Other ChargesAdjusted EBITDA, operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share may exclude the impact of charges related to transformation activities, goodwill and asset impairments, and divestitures.Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging ActivitiesCurrency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and any foreign currency hedging activities. These measures are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the impact of any foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rates and hedging activities.Pension and Postretirement AdjustmentsWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation), as well as gains and losses resulting from plan amendments, for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of other pension income (expense). We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects. We believe excluding these defined benefit plan gains and losses provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with plan amendments and short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values and similar factors.The deferred income tax effects of pension and postretirement adjustments are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictions, by the adjustments.Free Cash FlowWe calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in finance receivables and other investing activities. We believe free cash flow is an important indicator of how much cash is generated by our ongoing business operations and we use this as a measure of incremental cash available to invest in our business, meet our debt obligations and return cash to shareowners.Adjusted Return on Invested CapitalAdjusted ROIC is calculated as the trailing twelve months (“TTM”) of adjusted operating income divided by the average of total debt, non-current pension and postretirement benefit obligations and shareowners’ equity, at the current period end and the corresponding period end of the prior year. Because adjusted ROIC is not a measure defined by GAAP, we calculate it, in part, using non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are most indicative of our ongoing business performance. We consider adjusted ROIC to be a useful measure for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of our long-term capital investments.Adjusted Total Debt / Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted total debt is defined as our long-term debt and finance leases, including current maturities, plus non-current pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for restructuring and other costs and investment income and other. We believe the ratio of adjusted total debt to adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of our financial strength, and is a ratio used by third parties when evaluating the level of our indebtedness.Forward-Looking Non-GAAP MetricsFrom time to time when presenting forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, we are unable to provide quantitative reconciliations to the most closely correlated GAAP measure due to the uncertainty in the timing, amount or nature of any adjustments, which could be material in any period.Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Income Statement Items(in millions, except per share data):Three Months Ended September 30, 2022       As Reported (GAAP) Transformation &amp;

The Fed has dramatically raised its benchmark rate since the spring and is seen raising it again a 0.75 percentage point next week and then perhaps stepping back to lower rate increases from December forward.Slowing global growth has weighed on everything from stocks to oil prices. China stocks tumbled on Monday after Xi Jinping secured his power for a third term, pressuring a number of American companies that have operations there.Investors will be taking in earnings reports and outlooks from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and other big tech companies starting tomorrow. Later this week comes data on consumer confidence and inflation data that is closely watched by the Fed as it heads into its two-day policy meeting that starts next Tuesday.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Alphabet earningsGoogle parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is seen reporting earnings of $1.28 a share on $71.3 billion in revenue, and analysts will be listening to what it says about digital advertising after Snap (NYSE:SNAP) forecast a weak fourth quarter.2.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Salesforce, Inc. (CRM), UPS (UPS) and Devon Energy Corporation (DVN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Salesforce shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-45.5% vs. -28.2%). This reflects fears in the market about enterprise spending slowdown in response to the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Other headwinds include stiff competition, unfavorable currency fluctuations along with increasing investments in international expansions and data centers.However, Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver.The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. The Zacks analyst expect CRM revenues to grow at a CAGR of 15.7% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here &gt;&gt;&gt;)UPS shares have held up notably better than rival FedEx over the past year (down -17.5% vs. down -34.3%) and the broader market (the S&amp;P 500 index is down -18.8% over the past year). The Zacks analyst points out that operating expenses will continue to remain a near-term headwind for UPS and we will see that in Tuesday's Q3 quarterly release. But what sets UPS apart from FedEx and others is a track record of operating excellence and ability to generate strong cash flows. The ability to pass on higher costs to customers through increased shipping rates should help profitability to some extent. Longer term, UPS remains well positioned to capitalize on the favorable outlook for ecommerce growth. In first-half 2022, UPS generated free cash flows of $6,895 million compared with $6,804 million in first-half 2021. UPS paid out dividends worth $3,437 million in 2021, up 1.9% year over year. UPS aims to reward its shareholders with $8.2 billion in 2022, through dividends ($5.2 billion) and share buybacks ($3 billion).(You can read the full research report on United Parcel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Devon Energy’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the past year (+82.7% vs. +36.4%). The company is gaining from strong production from its high-quality domestic assets and recovery in commodity prices. WPX Energy and RimRock acquisitions expanded Devon Energy’s presence in the Delaware and Williston Basins, respectively.The divestiture of the Canadian and Barnett Shale gas assets will allow DVN Energy to focus on the oil-rich U.S. assets. Devon Energy’s stable free cash flow allows it to buy back shares and distribute dividends. Devon Energy has ample liquidity to meet near-term debt obligations.However, Devon Energy operates in a competitive industry, wherein a few operators are in a secure position due to stronger financial capabilities. Limited control over some joint venture properties and regulations is a headwind(You can read the full research report on Devon Energy here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Travelers Companies, Inc.

However, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility.Expanding Solar Market to Boost Enphase Energy (ENPH) GrowthPer the Zacks analyst, the expanding solar market that has set the stage for the solar microinverter market's boom tends to benefit Enphase as it remains a leading U.S. manufacturer of microinverters.Communications Business Aids MasTec (MTZ), Inflation HurtsPer the Zacks analyst, MasTec's presence in the telecommunications market, exposure in the clean energy market and expansion into heavy infrastructure bode well. Inflationary pressures are risks.Badger Meter (BMI) Benefits From Strong Product PortfolioPer the Zacks analyst, Badger Meter's performance is benefiting from strong revenue growth across all business segments. However, stiff competition and increasing input costs are concerns.Acquisitions &amp; Solid Pricing Benefits TopBuild, Inflation AilPer the Zacks analyst, solid pricing move and accretive acquisitions bode well for TopBuild. However, supply woes, higher material costs and labor constraints are risks.New UpgradesCapacity Expansion, Cost Reduction to Aid Albemarle (ALB)According to the Zacks analyst, Albemarle should gain from its actions to boost its global lithium derivative capacity. Its cost-saving actions will also support margins.Sprouts Farmers' (SFM) Omnichannel Offering to Propel SalesPer the Zacks analyst, Sprouts Farmers' assortment of better-for-you products, focus on providing hassle-free shopping through omnichannel offering and a network of fresh distribution center bode wellNew DowngradesPhilip Morris' (PM) Gross Margin Troubled by Escalated CostsPer the Zacks analyst, cost inflation is a concern for Philip Morris.

Yeah, good call here. I would say, of course, pretty late by Wells Fargo. The stock has been absolutely obliterated because of a very nasty profit warning a few weeks ago. But a good point.And this is-- you know, when you historically see companies cut to try to make an earnings number, when you hear a FedEx saying we're closing 100 hub and-- hub centers. We're closing places. We're letting people go. That usually will impact your sales. And that will usually mean, you may not be able to drive the earnings that you're trying to ultimately serve up to investors.BRAD SMITH: Well, there's a lot of capital expenditure that they're putting into their entire operation. They're pointing out within this, there's significant operational redesign underway at FedEx. Ultimately, should likely emerge as a less asset intensive and more efficient service provider they said in the note. However, that evolution, that's gonna take time. Measured in years, not quarters. That within the note.And then also you've got to look at freight trends, too. Citi had actually warned about this previously on that front, of overall freight trends going into Q4. And they had said, I believe their words were, ""head to the sidelines on FDX.""BRIAN SOZZI: I think one of the most interesting quarters this week. As you're sure we have Apple, we have Amazon. It is UPS tomorrow. What do we hear from UPS off of that really, I would say, bombshell pre-announcement by FedEx? And then ultimately, not a very good quarter or conference call for them. So I'd be very concerned about what UPS puts up tomorrow.]"

And people are watching that very closely, looking for signs whether or not the economy is tilting into a recession.What we're seeing so far, though, is that consumer spending has held in really strongly. You're hearing from banks, especially at the beginning of the earnings season, that consumers are still spending, that consumer spending is up double digits still year-over-year. And so there's strength in the economy at the most fundamental level, which is the consumer.And yet you have deteriorating company confidence, I think among the CEOs, thinking that they need to be preparing for a recession. So at a high level, that's what we're really seeing right now.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Scott, and to that point, I want to bring up what Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon did say shortly after the earnings were released. He said, ""on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States."" Comparing that to what we've heard from other bank CEOs, other executives, how does it stack up just in terms of the likelihood that we will see a significant slowdown?Story continuesSCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, that's a great question. I think David Solomon has probably been on the more bearish end of CEOs, bank CEOs especially, for the last several quarters. I think that it's easier to find a more negative comment from David than from some of the other ones. Obviously, Jamie Dimon has been notably bearish, talking about a hurricane that could be coming through the economy.And I would say that Brian Moynihan has been on the most bullish side, at Bank of America, of any of the bank CEOs. And that has proven the same case during this earnings season as well. So Brian Moynihan was one who reminded that the consumer is still very strong, relatively. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan CEOs David Solomon and Jamie Dimon were both a little bit more bearish.And I would say that David Solomon has been the most cautious of anybody, which maybe isn't too surprising because Goldman Sachs, obviously, has the largest capital markets business of those three, whereas Bank of America would be touching consumers more directly.- Right. Right. It's not just their interpretation. Some of them certainly have different business models.So let's move over to the consumer and what we're learning from them. Here's the Amex CEO.STEPHEN SQUERI: We're confident. Look, the spending speaks for itself. You know, I mean, just look at some of these numbers. You've got goods and services up 16%. Our US consumer is up 22%. Millennial spending is up 39%. Our T&amp;E, T spending is up 57%, international spending, 37%. We haven't seen any change.And you can look at this quarter over quarter. And the reality is is that last quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending. And this is like, I don't know, $1 billion behind or something like that. But if you look at year-over-year growth, we're not seeing any changes in consumer spending behavior at all.- A remarkable statement, given inflation. Was that an outlier statement or does it really sum up what we're hearing?SCOTT KRISILOFF: No, I think it sums up, honestly, with what we're hearing from consumer credit card companies especially, which is really the most important indicator, because credit card companies are obviously seeing all of the spend that consumers are doing, not just in certain categories, and the numbers that they're seeing are significant. So you heard American Express talk about double digit increases in some major categories.And so I think what's important and why we focus on what's going on at the credit card spending company, or the companies with credit card data, is that in some of the other areas of the consumer sector, we're seeing slowdown. And you're seeing this shift from goods back to services that's still playing out post-pandemic. And the card companies are capturing all of that. But if you just listen to certain segments, you may see decline in goods spending or boosts in service spending. But the card companies are encapsulating all of that.SEANA SMITH: And Scott, another big theme, obviously, is the strong dollar. We've heard it not only this quarter but, of course, over the past several quarters. When you take a look at the dollar's jump up, nearly 17% this year alone. I want to play a quick clip from what we heard on Netflix's earnings call after the results.SPENCER NEUMANN: The FX drag is significant. We mentioned in the letter, if we look at our-- you can do the math on four quarters now. When you kind of roll it out to a full year number, we're still holding to what we're calling FX neutral to the beginning of the year, January 1 of this year, to that 19% to 20% margin range FX neutral. You'll see, m actually is in the mid to higher end of that range.But on a reported basis, it's just a little over 17%. So there's about 2 and 1/2 points of drag in our margin. That equates to about $1 billion of revenue drag about $800 million of margin drag.SEANA SMITH: That was Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann. And Scott, we've heard it from a number of executives, IBM, one of the big companies, obviously out warning about their strong dollar, their CFO saying it's a big wild card to what's going to happen to the US dollar, obviously having a huge impact on their business.I'm sure we'll hear it more this week when we hear from some of the larger tech giants. What's on your radar as we look out over the next couple of weeks, when it comes to the strong dollar?SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, I mean, I think the strong dollar is one component, one major component that's impacting earnings growth in this quarter. And I think that's one of the big things that we're seeing this quarter versus previous quarters is that you're really starting to see earnings growth get impacted by some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in the economy.So the dollar is one, and Netflix pointed it out there. Procter &amp; Gamble also talked about a 9 point headwind just from currency in its most recent quarter. But then also, Procter &amp; Gamble talked about a 27 point overall earnings growth headwind, which again, 27 points is a massive number in terms of the growth headwind. And that was not just in terms of strong dollar but that was also just the general inflationary environment, both in terms of their input costs, and then also their freight and delivery costs.And so those things, what we've been talking about thematically in markets and capital markets for a long time, I think are starting to actually hit the financial statements of companies in this quarter. And that's really important for two reasons. Not only is it's impacting and showing where the economy is going, but as we think about what multiples to give to stocks, to equities, and ability to repay debt for companies as well, capital markets can get impacted a further leg here by decreasing earnings and some of these dynamics finally flowing through.- All right. That's great stuff. The Transcript Editor and Avondale Asset Management founder, Scott Krisiloff. Appreciate it, man. Thanks.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Cement and Construction Materials Stocks To Buy Now. The idea of fixing old buildings in different cities in the United States has taken root and the number of renovations has hit an all-time high recently. According to the American Institute of Architects (AIA), most of the billings at architecture firms have been from renovation orders rather than new construction. Kermit Baker, the AIA’s chief economist, said that the last time the demand for architecture services was so largely skewed towards renovations was during the Great Depression. For the first time in 20 years, the AIA has gathered data which indicates that renovations have exceeded 50% of the total architectural spend. Building renovation is incremental to lowering the significant carbon footprint of the construction industry. Many buildings are updated with improved energy efficiency solutions and HVAC systems, which boosts demand for construction materials firms. A weaker, recessionary economy means that renovation efforts will continue to dominate the construction industry, whereas a strong economy will signal new construction. As per construction industry group Associated General Contractors, new construction rates will potentially begin to recover in two years or so. To ride the renovation wave in the construction sector, and to benefit from the rebound in new construction in a few years, investors can add cement and construction materials stocks to their portfolios. Some of the top players in the materials sector include Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), and  Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM). Our Methodology We selected the following materials stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and future growth prospects. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continuesBest Cement and Construction Materials Stocks To Buy Now11. James Hardie Industries plc (NYSE:JHX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 3James Hardie Industries plc (NYSE:JHX) was founded in 1888 and is based in Dublin, Ireland.

Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 277,163 shares worth $6 million. In addition to Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), and  Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM), James Hardie Industries plc (NYSE:JHX) is one of the best materials stocks to invest in. 10. CRH plc (NYSE:CRH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, operating as a manufacturer and distributor of building materials. CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) manufactures and supplies cement, lime, aggregates, ready mixed concrete, and asphalt products, as well as retaining walls, patio products, glass and glazing products, and architectural hardware. On September 20, CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) concluded the latest phase of its share buyback program, returning another $300 million of cash to shareholders. This brings total cash returned to shareholders under the current share buyback plan to $3.8 billion since its initiation in May 2018. CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) is one of the best materials stocks to buy now. On September 13, investment advisory JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) but trimmed the price target on the shares to EUR 50 from EUR 59. Analyst Elodie Rall issued the ratings update. According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 12 hedge funds were long CRH plc (NYSE:CRH), with collective stakes worth $60.8 million, compared to 9 funds in the prior quarter worth $23.2 million. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates is the leading position holder in the company, with 752,445 shares worth $26.20 million. Here is what L1 Capital International specifically said about CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) was outlined in detail in our December 2021 Quarterly Report. Since then, the tragic war in Ukraine commenced with no signs of resolution. This war and associated sanctions on Russia have led to major disruptions to European energy markets. CRH is a relatively energy intensive business and around 20% of the Group’s operations are in Europe. We expect they will be negatively impacted by higher energy prices and reduced economic activity. Around 75% of CRH’s operations are in North America and will be less impacted compared to the European operations.We have followed and analyzed the global building products industry for nearly 25 years and the current share price of CRH presents an investment opportunity that rarely arises. CRH recently sold a business for US$3.8 billion, equating to almost 15x EBIT. In comparison, the remainder of CRH which consists of many businesses which are higher quality than the divested operation, is trading on around 9x EBIT, 11x PE, 9% free cashflow, 4% dividend yield and CRH is buying back around 3% of its shares annually. CRH has delivered shareholders a 15% return per annum, compounded over 50 years. The current share price provides compelling value for investors with a longer-term horizon.”9. Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) is a Colorado-based company that provides construction materials and related downstream products for the public infrastructure, residential, and non-residential end markets. The company's products include aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete, asphalt paving mixes, concrete products, and plastics components. It is one of the best materials stocks to consider. Citi analyst Anthony Pettinari on October 10 reiterated a Buy recommendation on Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) but lowered the price target on the stock to $29 from $35. The analyst trimmed estimates in North America building products ahead of the Q3 earnings season to reflect softening residential demand, cost pressure, unfavorable weather, and ongoing labor and material availability issues. Within building products, the analyst leans towards aggregates producers as he expects higher public construction to meaningfully offset slow residential demand.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 15 hedge funds were long Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM), compared to 21 funds in the earlier quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 893,982 shares worth $20.8 million. Here is what Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund has to say about Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Summit Materials is a vertically integrated construction materials-based company that supplies aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete, and asphalt in the United States and British Columbia. Fears of a potential economic slowdown and a corresponding cooling in construction activity weighed on the company’s shares in the quarter. However, Summit has made noteworthy strides in optimizing its business portfolio through the divestiture of underperforming assets, allowing it to drive margins higher through efficiency gains and accretive acquisitions. Summit also is the beneficiary of ongoing migration trends favoring construction activity in the exurban and rural markets it primarily serves.”8. Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Next on our list of the best materials stocks is Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN), a Virginia-based company that distributes residential and non-residential roofing materials and complementary building products to contractors, home builders, building owners, lumberyards, and retailers. On October 4, Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN) reported that it had partnered with SumoQuote, which provides an integration of SumoQuote’s technology with Beacon’s eCommerce platform, Beacon PRO+.

(NASDAQ:BECN) is one of the top materials stocks to buy now. On October 20, Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer maintained a Buy rating on Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN) but slashed the price target on the shares to $79 from $90. The analyst thinks the Q3 earnings season for building products will be characterized by strong earnings results and mostly reiterated short-term guidance, but he would not be surprised by ""yet another move lower"" in estimates for next year. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 19 hedge funds were bullish on Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN) at the end of Q2 2022, up from 14 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the leading stake in the company, comprising 1.3 million shares worth nearly $68 million. Here is what Fiduciary Management has to say about Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Beacon is the largest publicly traded (#2 overall) distributor of roofing materials and complementary building products in the U.S. and Canada. Beacon serves more than 90,000 customers and offers 140,000 SKUs from over 400 branches throughout all 50 states (97% of sales) and 6 Canadian provinces (3% of sales). Beacon makes 1.7 million annual deliveries (within a two-hour radius) using its fleet of specialized trucks. Since the sale of the non-core Interiors division (2021), their run-rate sales have been 53% Residential Roofing; 25% Commercial Roofing; and 22% Complementary Building Products (siding, windows, specialty exterior building products, insulation, and waterproofing systems).Good BusinessValuationManagementInvestment ThesisBeacon is a simple business driven by largely non-cyclical, non-discretionary demand. While Beacon has achieved scale in an industry that has consolidated substantially over the last decade, under prior management they were saddled with (1) a challenging and costly integration (2) substantial debt and interest costs, and (3) a separate Interiors business. Under their new CEO they sold Interiors, and are progressing on strategic initiatives. Strong industry fundamentals have led to rapid restoration of financial flexibility and Beacon’s future now looks solid. While expecting a sequential slowdown in growth (in part due to lower y/y storm activity) and a decline in margin, we think enhanced focus on organic growth and structural margin improvement should help reaccelerate future earnings, particularly as replacement demand will likely benefit from the strong build period from 2000-2006.”7. Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) is a Florida-based company that designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes interior and exterior doors for the new construction and repair, renovation, and remodeling sectors of the residential and non-residential building construction markets worldwide. Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer on October 20 maintained a Buy rating on Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) but slashed the price target on the shares to $99 from $135. If earnings season changes little, construction stocks will potentially trade cheaply until the most bearish of negative revision scenarios can be taken off the table, which is unlikely to happen until next year, contended the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 19 hedge funds were long Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 20 funds in the preceding quarter. Kevin Oram and Peter Uddo’s Praesidium Investment Management Company is the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 1.5 million shares valued at $114.2 million. 6. Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) is a Texas-based company that produces and supplies heavy construction materials and light building materials in the United States. It operates through Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, and Recycled Paperboard segments. Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) paid a dividend of $0.14 per share to shareholders on October 14. Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) is one of the top materials stocks to monitor. On October 10, Citi analyst Anthony Pettinari reaffirmed a Buy recommendation on Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) but lowered the price target on the shares to $136 from $146. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 22 hedge funds were long Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 183,884 shares worth $20.2 million. Like Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), and  Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM), smart investors are bullish on Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) for exposure to the materials sector. Here is what L1 Capital International specifically said about Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The investment thesis for Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) was featured in our December 2020 Quarterly Report. Since then, the business has met our expectations. Eagle Materials is a low-cost regional producer of cement and wallboard. The U.S. cement industry is sold out, with imports required to meet demand levels. Eagle Materials operates in the centre of the U.S. where imports from the coast are prohibitively expensive. These sold-out conditions are before an expected increase in demand in 2023 and beyond as the U.S. implements its US$1 trillion infrastructure spending program.Eagle Materials’ wallboard operations also have a cost advantage over its competitors, predominantly using natural gypsum located next to its manufacturing facilities, rather than relying on more expensive synthetic gypsum derived from the waste generated by coal power plants or imported natural gypsum.Both the cement and gypsum industry have increased prices to offset cost inflation (see Figure 11). Eagle Materials has benefitted from these price increases and expanded margins due to its low-cost position in the industry. While we expect some softening in the wallboard industry due to reduced new residential construction, we consider Eagle Materials is currently materially undervalued, trading on 11x EV/EBIT, 12x PE and a 10% free cash flow yield.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cement and Construction Materials Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Momentum Stocks To Buy10 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy10 Best Video Conferencing Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 11 Best Cement and Construction Materials Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

ZBH is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.82 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.66%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the consensus estimate on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 7.4%. Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayZimmer Biomet is expected to have witnessed a recovery in its legacy business in the third quarter, primarily driven by the continued opening up of the economy. Over the third-quarter months, it was observed that people kept opting for non-COVID elective orthopedic and musculoskeletal procedures.However, the company might have faced upheaval in business, thanks to the global inflationary situation in terms of mounting labor and raw material costs, severe staffing shortages and supply issues, which might have impacted ZBH’s bottom line in the third quarter.Further, Zimmer Biomet, which has a broad business base in China, is expected to have come under pressure due to the lingering COVID-led lockdowns and limited trade. Further, the implementation of the volume-based procurement program brought down China orthopedic device prices, which might have otherwise impacted ZBH’s business in this region.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteOn a positive note, priority areas like the S.E.T. business (comprising Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) are expected to have put up a better third-quarter performance compared with 2021, fueled by ramped-up investment in R&amp;D and commercial infrastructure.We expect this arm to deliver strong results on the back of the company’s focus on sports and extremities, especially upper extremities, trauma and Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic. Zimmer Biomet is likely to have gained from the September launch of the Identity shoulder system in the United States. This might have partially contributed to the company’s Q3 revenues.Story continuesWe expect the company to have witnessed strength in its performances within its Hips and Knees product portfolios in the United States. Apart from a strong recovery in elective procedures, easy comparisons outside the United States, along with strong knee procedure recovery across most regions, continued global traction for the Persona knee system, especially with Persona Revision in the United States, and ROSA penetration and pull-through are expected to have contributed to the company’s Hipsand Knees business.The strong performance of Avenir Complete is likely to have continued during the third quarter, thus driving the Hip business. In this regard, the company earlier this year noted that one of the fastest-growing subcategories of hip is the direct anterior approach. Both the recently-launched Avenir Complete and ROSA applications target that fast-growth submarket.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.63 billion, suggesting a 15.2% drop from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.56 indicates a 13.8% decline from the year-ago adjusted earnings.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates. This is not the case here as you can see:Earnings ESP: Zimmer Biomet has an Earnings ESP of -0.59%.

Sales were up 9 percent compared to sales for the same period last year. Excluding currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, core sales grew 4 percent in the third quarter.

While we have not yet set our 2023 plan, we believe we are well positioned to grow next year given pricing carryover, accretion from Manitowoc Ice, reduced manufacturing inefficiencies that have been an ongoing issue in 2022, and our Transformation initiatives gaining momentum.

345,d92016cf-c34e-33f7-a1eb-ffef644869c4,TSCO,2022-10-25,‘Who Doesn’t Like a Bargain?’: Oppenheimer Suggests 2 Stocks to Buy,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doesn-t-bargain-oppenheimer-suggests-150719765.html,1666624039.0,STORY,"['RVMD', 'TSCO', 'SNY']","[This year we saw declines pretty much across the board, with the S&amp;P 500 tumbling ~20%. But last week was the index’s best week since June – the S&amp;P had a weekly gain of about 4.7%. We’ve seen several of these bounces this year, and the question is, are they bullish indicators or merely 'dead cats'?According to Oppenheimer’s chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus, it shouldn't really make a difference whether we’re looking at bullish indicators or bear market rallies. The key here is simply taking advantage of a bargain price. That current low prices give investors a chance to 'love assets when they’re looking their least attractive in some time.’Stoltzfus goes on to explain today’s opportunities in greater detail: “We often say that there’s no ‘all clear’ signal that sounds when it’s a good time to buy stocks, but for long-term investors and those with cash to put to work, the broad market at these levels offers opportunity, in our view. We can’t say that the market has bottomed at these levels, nor that the bear market might not grind on for some time to come, but with so much bad news already priced in, the potential rewards of investing at these levels are looking more attractive relative to the risks.”The stock analysts at Oppenheimer are following Stoltzfus’s lead, and picking out stocks that are primed for gains despite the confusing market environment. After running two of these stocks through TipRanks’ database, we found out that the rest of the Street is also on board, as each boasts a “Strong Buy” consensus rating.Revolution Medicines, Inc. (RVMD)We'll start with Revolution Medicines, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company in the precision oncology niche. The company is working on a novel research approach to the treatment of cancer, specifically focusing on drug candidates designed to inhibit RAS-addicted malignancies. The company has an active research pipeline featuring several clinical stage and pre-clinical drug candidates, in two groups, RAS(ON) inhibitors and RAS companion inhibitors.Story continuesIn the second group, the company’s lead drug candidate, RMC-4630, is under development in conjunction with pharma giant Sanofi. The company reports regular quarterly revenue due to collaboration payments from Sanofi. In the most recent quarterly report, for 2Q22, the company had $9.1 million in such revenues.Valuable collaborations and solid cash position provide Revolution Medicines with a sound foundation for its research programs, which are proceeding apace. In September of this year, the company announced that it had dosed the first patients in its Phase 1/1b study of RMC-6291, the first mutant selective RAS(ON) inhibitor to reach this stage of testing. RMC-6291 showed a best-in-class pre-clinical profile, and targets cancers that harbor the KRASG12C mutation.Also at Phase 1/1b is RMC-6236, an orally dosed drug designed to combat cancers with a variety of RAS mutations. The current study is looking at -6236 as a monotherapy and expects to have clinical trial results next year.The most advanced drug candidate, RMC-4630, is currently undergoing several concurrent clinical trials. The RAS companion inhibitor is being tested as a combination therapy, in conjunction with sotorasib, in a Phase 2 trial overseen by Revolution Medicines. This trial is expected to release results next year. The other two clinical trials of this drug candidate, a Phase 1 and a Phase 1/2, are both being overseen by Sanofi. The first is in conjunction with Keytruda, and the second with adagrasib.Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson has initiated coverage of Revolution Medicines, and in his view the company will benefit as its approach meets a ‘high unmet medical need.’“We view RVMD as a pioneering oncology company developing novel therapies targeting RAS-mutated cancers with potentially best-in-class KRASG12C (ON) inhibitor candidate RMC-6291 and later-stage RMC-4630 targets SHP2 for combination approaches. KRAS-G12D (ON) and pan-KRAS (ON) inhibitors RMC-9805 and RMC-6236, respectively, have first-in-class potential…. We forecast $2.7B of risk-adjusted peak sales for RVMD, and our SOTP analysis ascribes the majority of valuation potential to the KRAS(ON) portfolio,” Olson opined.Looking forward, Olson gives RVMD shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target of $30 implies a one-year upside potential of 66%. (To watch Olson’s track record, click here)Overall, the 4 most recent analyst reviews of Revolution Medicines include 3 Buys against 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $18.17 and their $32.25 average price target suggests an upside of ~79% in the next 12 months. (See RVMD stock forecast on TipRanks)Tractor Supply Company (TSCO)Let’s shift gears now, and look at Tractor Supply, a well-known retailer specializing in home, lawn, and garden supplies; livestock and pet supplies for everyone from professional and amateur ranchers and ordinary pet owners; tools and hardware; outdoor apparel and footwear, and hunting gear. The company styles itself as a rural lifestyle retailer, and operates over 2,000 stores in 49 states.Tractor Supply is a leader in a profitable niche, and the company’s quarterly revenues show the story graphically. It typically posts the highest revenues and earnings in Q2 of a year; this is a well-established pattern for Tractor Supply, based on seasonal shopping in the spring when customers restock on outdoor gear, home improvement supplies, and farm equipment. Overlaid on that pattern is a second trend of consistent year-over-year revenue and earnings gains.In the latest quarterly report, for 3Q22, the company posted EPS of $2.10 per share, beating the $2.08 forecast and growing 7.7% year-over-year. At the top line, the reported revenue of $3.27 billion was up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter. The company saw its comp store sales grow 5.4% y/y, and returned a total of $225.5 million to shareholders through its share repurchase program and its quarterly dividend.Brian Nagel, 5-star analyst with Oppenheimer, describes Tractor Supply’s ‘underlying trends’ as ‘decidedly solid,’ and goes on to elaborate on the details: “We look upon continued solid sales and earnings trends at TSCO lately as reflective of the company's utilizing a now even better-positioned business model to capitalize upon underlying spending strength amongst core consumers and of the ongoing competitive fallout within the broader feed and pet categories. We continue to recommend TSCO as a compelling hedge play within discretionary retail, amid ongoing macro challenges and market concerns of a forthcoming, more severe economic downturn.”This outlook gains an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating from Nagel, whose $270 price target indicates room for ~31% share growth in the year ahead. (To watch Nagel’s track record, click here)All in all, this strongly-positioned niche retailer has picked up 16 recent analyst reviews, and these break down to 12 Buys and 4 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $230 implies ~11% upside potential for the stock on the one-year time frame.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in agriculture and food science are expected to grow by 7% from 2018 to 2028.

Further, other research done by the Bureau underscores the growing demand for workers with expertise in industry-related skills citing the need now totals four million workers needed to replace the eight million that exited the labor force throughout the past three years. Tractor Supply hopes scholarships like these will help the industries fill open positions that require technical skills like clinical veterinarian, carpentry, plumbing and electrical specialties.National FFA Foundation President Molly Ball stated, ""The $5 million Tractor Supply Foundation donation to the FFA Scholarship Program will help an additional 150 FFA members annually with the cost of furthering their education. At $5,000 and $10,000, these scholarships will make a big impact for students awarded the FFA Future Leaders Scholarship Fund by Tractor Supply.""To support the FFA Future Leaders Scholarship Fund by Tractor Supply, customers will have an opportunity to donate at checkout, either in Tractor Supply stores or online at TractorSupply.com.

However, more than a decade after they were introduced, rates of forest destruction, poverty and child labour in cocoa remain high.The schemes have been much criticised for not committing to paying farmers a living income.Oreo cookie maker Mondelez said Cocoa Life will ""aim to increase the number of farming households reaching a living income, enhance child protection systems and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms globally'.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Mondelez InternationalOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Fredric Reynolds, for US$5.7m worth of shares, at about US$63.29 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$58.74. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In total, Mondelez International insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.1% of Mondelez International shares, worth about US$96m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Mondelez International Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Mondelez International insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us.

First, we initiated small positions in U.S. natural gas producers Chesapeake (NYSE:CHK).Given its superior environmental profile compared to other fossil fuels, we have long favored natural gas in our energy holdings. Combustion of natural gas releases 50% less CO2 than coal, 25% less CO2 than gasoline and dramatically less particulate and pollution, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. With the advances in shale production this century, the U.S. has become a natural gas powerhouse with some of the lowest-cost and largest reserves in the world. But because natural gas is difficult to ship across the ocean (it must be liquefied, which requires expensive infrastructure on both ends of the voyage), America’s gas bounty has ironically proved a burden for U.S. producers.""

A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance.However, at times it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory.Receivables Turnover: This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the ""accounts receivable turnover ratio"" or ""debtor's turnover ratio"" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Story continuesOperating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Here are the top three stocks that made it through the screen:Oxford Industries is an apparel company which designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of its owned and licensed brands.

354,ef4719ad-2f7b-35f3-9fce-978e723d10e1,TXT,2022-10-25,Will Mixed Segment Performance Aid Textron's (TXT) Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mixed-segment-performance-aid-textrons-124212008.html,1666615332,STORY,['TXT'],"[Textron Inc. TXT is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27, before market open. Textron has a four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.28%, on average. Solid commercial deliveries and favorable pricing are expected to have contributed to Textron’s revenues. However, unimpressive performance from Bell and Textron Systems might have hurt overall results.Textron Aviation Remains a Key CatalystThe steady air travel trend observant in recent times has been boosting the commercial aviation market, which in turn must have bolstered TXT’s aviation segment’s performance in the third quarter. Thus, one may expect the company to have witnessed strong deliveries for Citation jets and commercial turboprops in Q3. This, in turn, must have boosted the segment’s revenues. Also, higher aftermarket volume from increased aircraft utilization is expected to have added an impetus to this segment’s performance in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Textron Aviation segment’s revenues in the third quarter is pegged at $1,368 million, indicating an improvement of 15.8% from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Textron Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTextron Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTextron Inc. price-eps-surprise | Textron Inc. QuoteBell’s Performance May Continue to Be a DragThe Bell segment is likely to have been negatively impacted by lower revenues from the military business, primarily related to lower H-1 production. Lower helicopter delivery due to COVID-induced supply chain headwinds might have boosted the growth of this segment. However, the commercial side of the segment is expected to reflect strong demand trends.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Bell segment’s revenues in the third quarter is pegged at $703 million, indicating a decline of 8.6% from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Lower Volumes From Textron SystemsThe U.S. Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan on its fee-for-service as well as aircraft support contracts for Textron’s Air Systems might have resulted in lower volumes for the Textron Systems unit in the third quarter. This is expected to have negatively impacted its segment’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Textron System’s revenues in the third quarter is pegged at $300 million, indicating an increase of 0.3% from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Bright Expectations for the Industrial UnitWe remain optimistic about the revenues from the Industrial unit, driven by higher pricing volume in specialized vehicles, mainly in personal transportation and golf product lines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Textron System’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $791 million, indicating an improvement of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.Q3 EstimatesThe addition of PIPISTREL, post its acquisition this April, must have also boosted Q3 revenue growth. Considering the mixed segmental performance expected for TXT, we remain optimistic about its overall top-line outcome. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.21 billion, suggesting a rise of 7.3% from the year-ago quarter.Higher commercial deliveries as well as favorable pricing must have bolstered its bottom line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Also, favorable revenues must have boosted its year-over-year earnings performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 94 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 10.6% from the prior-year reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for TXT this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that is not the case here.Textron has an Earnings ESP of -3.90% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Selling at an average price of US$61.62, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Coca-ColaThe President &amp; CFO, John Murphy, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$62.29 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$57.57. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In total, Coca-Cola insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Coca-Cola Insiders Are Selling The StockThere was substantially more insider selling, than buying, of Coca-Cola shares over the last three months. We note insiders cashed in US$2.9m worth of shares. On the other hand we note insider Carolyn Everson bought US$61k worth of shares , as previously mentioned . Generally this level of net selling might be considered a bit bearish.Story continuesDoes Coca-Cola Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Coca-Cola insiders own about US$1.6b worth of shares (which is 0.7% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Coca-Cola Tell Us?The stark truth for Coca-Cola is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Coca-Cola makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Coca-Cola. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Analysts had expected earnings of 64 cents per share on revenue of $10.52 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.The company forecast organic revenue to rise 14% to 15% in 2022, compared to prior expectation of 12% to 13% increase.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221025005338/en/HighlightsQuarterly PerformanceRevenues: Net revenues grew 10% to $11.1 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 16%. Organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across operating segments and included 12% growth in price/mix and 4% growth in concentrate sales.Margin: Operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 27.9% versus 28.9% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.5% versus 30.0% in the prior year. Comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) compressed as strong topline growth was more than offset by the impact of the BODYARMOR acquisition, higher operating costs, an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, and currency headwinds.Earnings per share: EPS grew 14% to $0.65, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 7% to $0.69. Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of an 11-point currency headwind.Story continuesMarket share: The company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.Cash flow: Cash flow from operations was $8.1 billion year-to-date, a decline of $1.2 billion versus the prior year, as strong business performance was more than offset by the impact of cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year and higher 2021 annual incentives in the current year. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $7.3 billion, a decline of $1.2 billion versus the prior year.Company UpdatesLeveraging strong revenue growth management capabilities to meet consumer needs: In an environment where consumer preferences are rapidly evolving, the company is focused on expanding its offerings to fit all consumers’ budgets. The Coca-Cola Value Bundle, which was launched in North America during the third quarter, is an example of how the company is offering more choices to cost-conscious consumers. The bundle features an assortment of core sparkling brands at relevant and competitive price points. By utilizing end-to-end messaging across platforms, these offerings are retaining and recruiting more consumers while creating value for our customers. Additionally, the company is balancing the mix between affordability and premiumization, while driving pricing actions in the marketplace in response to ongoing cost inflation. For example, in Australia the company achieved low double-digit retail value growth in the sparkling category and gained approximately 1.5 points of sparkling value share through intelligent segmented pricing, increased premium mix through multi-packs of mini cans, and optimized promotional initiatives for at-home occasions.Turning insights into global brand experiences: The company continues to engage and attract consumers through globally scaled marketing campaigns driven by consumer insights. The ""What the Fanta"" marketing and innovation platform is an example of how the company is executing with its global networked marketing partner to identify and scale what resonates with consumers, from taste to brand experiences. Now launched in over 30 markets globally, the experience-driven platform is designed to spark adventure and intrigue through bold innovative flavors complemented by social media campaigns and multi-channel activations. With a uniform marketing platform and a streamlined offering of flavors that resonate with local tastes, ""What the Fanta"" is driving increased profitability in sparkling flavors and is recruiting more consumers, as approximately 40% of consumers in Europe who purchased ""What the Fanta"" beverages in 2022 were new to the Fanta® brand.Strategically expanding in emerging categories: Since entering into the ready-to-drink (RTD) alcohol beverages category in 2018 with Lemon-Dou in Japan, the company has continued its test-and-learn approach with disciplined experiments around alcohol occasions globally. The company is leveraging brands with strong credentials, such as Topo Chico®, while adding to the existing portfolio of Schweppes® premium adult cocktail mixers and tonics. This year, Simply Spiked Lemonade™ and Fresca™ Mixed were introduced in the United States through brand authorization agreements with Molson Coors Beverage Company and Constellation Brands, Inc., respectively, and both offerings are seeing encouraging early results. These initiatives support the company’s disciplined approach on its journey to become a total beverage company with beverage options for all occasions and need states.Increasing water security through collaboration and collective action: The company continues to focus on collaborating with businesses and nongovernmental organizations to create a more sustainable and better shared future. During the quarter, at World Water Week 2022, the company focused on how corporate water stewardship can drive collective action to help address water challenges. Over the past two years, the company has stepped up investments in nature-based water solutions as an important part of its 2030 Water Security Strategy. These solutions, which include meadow and forest restorations, invasive species removal and floodplain management, can provide a wide range of benefits, including better water quality, carbon sequestration and enhanced biodiversity.Operating Review – Three Months Ended September 30, 2022Revenues and VolumePercent ChangeConcentrate Sales1Price/MixCurrency ImpactAcquisitions, Divestitures and Structural Changes, NetReported Net RevenuesOrganic Revenues2Unit Case Volume3Consolidated412(8)210164Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa119(16)0420(1)Latin America612(6)012185North America(1)150621141Asia Pacific94(10)04149Global Ventures417(12)(15)0(10)58Bottling Investments163(12)071916Operating Income and EPSPercent ChangeReported Operating IncomeItems Impacting ComparabilityCurrency ImpactComparable Currency Neutral2Consolidated7(2)(10)18Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa21(18)19Latin America00(7)7North America255020Asia Pacific(1)(8)(12)19Global Ventures(41)1(5)(37)Bottling Investments(43)(20)(7)(16)Percent ChangeReported EPSItems Impacting ComparabilityCurrency ImpactComparable Currency Neutral2Consolidated EPS148(11)18Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.1 For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any.2 Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

Hydration grew 6%, led by strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Sports drinks grew 6%, primarily driven by growth of Aquarius®, BODYARMOR® and Powerade®. Coffee grew 5%, primarily driven by cycling the impact of pandemic-related Costa® retail store closures in the United Kingdom in the prior year and continued expansion of Costa® coffee across markets.

Refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.3 Unit case volume is computed based on average daily sales.4 Due to the combination of multiple business models in the Global Ventures operating segment, the composition of concentrate sales and price/mix may fluctuate materially from period to period. Therefore, the company places greater focus on revenue growth as the best indicator of underlying performance of the Global Ventures operating segment.OutlookThe 2022 and 2023 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2022 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2022 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2022 projected comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported cost of goods sold, full-year 2022 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2022 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported EPS, full-year 2022 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported EPS, full-year 2023 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2023 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported effective tax rate, or full-year 2023 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes throughout 2022; the actual impact of changes in commodity costs throughout 2022; the exact timing and amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2022 and 2023; and the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2022 and 2023. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company’s full-year 2022 and full-year 2023 reported financial results.Full Year 2022On March 8, 2022, the company announced the suspension of its business in Russia as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. The approximate direct impacts of this are estimated to be as follows:1% impact to unit case volume – No Change1% impact to net revenues and operating income – Updated$0.03 impact to comparable EPS (non-GAAP) – No ChangeThese estimated impacts are reflected in the outlook commentary below.The company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 14% to 15%. – UpdatedFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 7% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 2% tailwind from acquisitions and divestitures. – UpdatedThe company expects commodity price inflation to be a high single-digit percentage headwind on comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP) based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions. – No ChangeThe company’s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.0%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, if the company were not to prevail. – UpdatedGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 15% to 16% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 6% to 7%, versus $2.32 in 2021. – UpdatedComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 9% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 1% headwind from acquisitions and divestitures. – No ChangeThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $10.5 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $12.0 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. – No ChangeFourth Quarter 2022 Considerations – NewComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 1% tailwind from acquisitions.Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 9% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.Full Year 2023 Considerations – NewThe company is providing the following considerations for 2023:The company is encouraged by the underlying topline momentum, and will leverage its capabilities to sustain topline growth amidst the ongoing inflationary backdrop.The company expects global inflation to continue to impact its expenses across the board, and also expects commodity prices to remain volatile. The company has benefited from its hedges in 2022 and expects elevated inflation on a per case basis in 2023.The company’s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.5%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, if the company were not to prevail.The company’s initial currency outlook for full-year 2023 is as follows:Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 5% to 6% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) is expected to include an approximate 7% to 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.The company will provide full-year 2023 guidance when it reports fourth quarter earnings.NotesAll references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales, unless otherwise noted. ""Unit case"" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. ""Unit case volume"" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.""Concentrate sales"" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, ""concentrate sales"" represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, ""concentrate sales"" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.""Price/mix"" represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.First quarter 2022 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2021, and fourth quarter 2022 financial results will be impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2021. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.Conference CallThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss third quarter 2022 operating results today, Oct. 25, 2022, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company’s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the ""Investors"" section.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.22 billion, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.92% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for JELD-WEN?For JELD-WEN, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.77%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that JELD-WEN will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that JELD-WEN would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.57, delivering a surprise of -17.39%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.JELD-WEN doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsWeyerhaeuser (WY), another stock in the Zacks Building Products - Wood industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.41 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -31.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.27 billion, down 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Weyerhaeuser has been revised 13.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -14.22%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Weyerhaeuser will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Sempra in FocusSempra (SRE) is headquartered in San Diego, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of 7.56% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.14 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.22%. In comparison, the Utility - Gas Distribution industry's yield is 3.2%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.78%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $4.58 is up 4.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Sempra has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.77%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Sempra's current payout ratio is 52%, meaning it paid out 52% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for SRE for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $8.64 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 2.49%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, SRE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:BERY) is an Indiana-based producer and distributor of plastic packaging products with 300 facilities around the world.In a research note issued on October 13, George Staphos at Bank of America assigned Berry Global Group, Inc. (NYSE:BERY) a target price of $72 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. Experts believe that the stock sell-off in the last two months has already priced in the weak Q3 2022 results and even a possibility of a downward revision of annual guidance.

(NYSE:BERY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“As described in previous letters, our investment universe has been extended beyond value-oriented special situations to include growth-oriented firms using a value framework. This includes companies that generate growth through transition and consolidation. There have been modest changes within the portfolio in the last quarter in line with our low historical turnover rates. We sold some of our slowergrowing names and invested some of our cash into Thryv (described in the case study below) and Berry Global Group, as well as to fund the Millicom rights offering and oversubscription. There are also some interesting developments in the US digital marketing market that I discuss below.One example of public LBO firms you have in your portfolio is Berry Global (Berry). Berry is a plastic and engineering materials packaging firm that provides packaging solutions to health, hygiene products, and consumer products firms in the United State and Europe. Berry’s growth model focuses on plastic and engineered materials continuing to take more shares of packaging from other materials, specifically in the health, hygiene, and consumer products realm where the growth is the strongest which provides 2- 3% annual growth. Synergistic M&amp;A is adding an additional 3-4% per year to growth. These sources of growth are enhanced by opportunistic operational leverage from scale and share repurchases (5% annual growth). Over the past eight years, Berry’s net income margins doubled, with a 3x increase in revenues. These factors should lead to 10-12% EPS growth going forward. Berry has had 18% and 28% EPS growth over the past five and 10 years, respectively. Part of Berry’s strategy is to lever up to purchase a geographically expanding or complementary product packaging firm and pay the debt down with cash flows post acquisition, similar to private equity funds. Berry has done this three times since its IPO in 2011. Once debt is paid down a reasonable level, Berry has been repurchasing stock if another reasonably priced acquisition cannot be found. This strategy is similar to that of Asbury, described in previous letters. Compared to other packaging firms, Berry has amongst the highest inventory turns and margins. This has resulted in 25% to 40% returns on equity over the past five years. Berry currently trades for a FCF multiple of about 7.6x and a free cash flow yield of 13%. Berry’s BBBrated debt (with an EBITA coverage ratio of 6.2x) is currently yielding 6.2%, for a FCF-debt yield of 6.8%, which is high compared to the current market equity risk premium of about 5% and the projected growth in excess of the market. Given the projected EPS growth of 10% per year, Berry should trade at 29x earnings using Grahams’ formula of 8.5 + 2 * growth rate. Even at half this multiple—15x—Berry would trade at two times its current price.”8. Westlake Corporation (NYSE:WLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Westlake Corporation (NYSE:WLK) is a Houston, Texas-based global diversified industrial entity that is involved in the production of semi-finished thermoplastic products.

According to the American Institute of Architects (AIA), most of the billings at architecture firms have been from renovation orders rather than new construction. Kermit Baker, the AIA’s chief economist, said that the last time the demand for architecture services was so largely skewed towards renovations was during the Great Depression. For the first time in 20 years, the AIA has gathered data which indicates that renovations have exceeded 50% of the total architectural spend. Building renovation is incremental to lowering the significant carbon footprint of the construction industry. Many buildings are updated with improved energy efficiency solutions and HVAC systems, which boosts demand for construction materials firms. A weaker, recessionary economy means that renovation efforts will continue to dominate the construction industry, whereas a strong economy will signal new construction. As per construction industry group Associated General Contractors, new construction rates will potentially begin to recover in two years or so. To ride the renovation wave in the construction sector, and to benefit from the rebound in new construction in a few years, investors can add cement and construction materials stocks to their portfolios.

(NASDAQ:BECN) reported that it had partnered with SumoQuote, which provides an integration of SumoQuote’s technology with Beacon’s eCommerce platform, Beacon PRO+. This partnership will offer a streamlined process to deliver custom quotes to customers. Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN) is one of the top materials stocks to buy now. On October 20, Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer maintained a Buy rating on Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN) but slashed the price target on the shares to $79 from $90. The analyst thinks the Q3 earnings season for building products will be characterized by strong earnings results and mostly reiterated short-term guidance, but he would not be surprised by ""yet another move lower"" in estimates for next year. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 19 hedge funds were bullish on Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN) at the end of Q2 2022, up from 14 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the leading stake in the company, comprising 1.3 million shares worth nearly $68 million. Here is what Fiduciary Management has to say about Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Beacon is the largest publicly traded (#2 overall) distributor of roofing materials and complementary building products in the U.S. and Canada. Beacon serves more than 90,000 customers and offers 140,000 SKUs from over 400 branches throughout all 50 states (97% of sales) and 6 Canadian provinces (3% of sales). Beacon makes 1.7 million annual deliveries (within a two-hour radius) using its fleet of specialized trucks. Since the sale of the non-core Interiors division (2021), their run-rate sales have been 53% Residential Roofing; 25% Commercial Roofing; and 22% Complementary Building Products (siding, windows, specialty exterior building products, insulation, and waterproofing systems).Good BusinessValuationManagementInvestment ThesisBeacon is a simple business driven by largely non-cyclical, non-discretionary demand. While Beacon has achieved scale in an industry that has consolidated substantially over the last decade, under prior management they were saddled with (1) a challenging and costly integration (2) substantial debt and interest costs, and (3) a separate Interiors business. Under their new CEO they sold Interiors, and are progressing on strategic initiatives. Strong industry fundamentals have led to rapid restoration of financial flexibility and Beacon’s future now looks solid. While expecting a sequential slowdown in growth (in part due to lower y/y storm activity) and a decline in margin, we think enhanced focus on organic growth and structural margin improvement should help reaccelerate future earnings, particularly as replacement demand will likely benefit from the strong build period from 2000-2006.”7. Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) is a Florida-based company that designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes interior and exterior doors for the new construction and repair, renovation, and remodeling sectors of the residential and non-residential building construction markets worldwide. Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer on October 20 maintained a Buy rating on Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) but slashed the price target on the shares to $99 from $135. If earnings season changes little, construction stocks will potentially trade cheaply until the most bearish of negative revision scenarios can be taken off the table, which is unlikely to happen until next year, contended the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 19 hedge funds were long Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 20 funds in the preceding quarter. Kevin Oram and Peter Uddo’s Praesidium Investment Management Company is the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 1.5 million shares valued at $114.2 million. 6. Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) is a Texas-based company that produces and supplies heavy construction materials and light building materials in the United States.

(NASDAQ:STLD), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), and  Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM), smart investors are bullish on Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) for exposure to the materials sector. Here is what L1 Capital International specifically said about Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The investment thesis for Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) was featured in our December 2020 Quarterly Report. Since then, the business has met our expectations. Eagle Materials is a low-cost regional producer of cement and wallboard. The U.S. cement industry is sold out, with imports required to meet demand levels. Eagle Materials operates in the centre of the U.S. where imports from the coast are prohibitively expensive. These sold-out conditions are before an expected increase in demand in 2023 and beyond as the U.S. implements its US$1 trillion infrastructure spending program.Eagle Materials’ wallboard operations also have a cost advantage over its competitors, predominantly using natural gypsum located next to its manufacturing facilities, rather than relying on more expensive synthetic gypsum derived from the waste generated by coal power plants or imported natural gypsum.Both the cement and gypsum industry have increased prices to offset cost inflation (see Figure 11). Eagle Materials has benefitted from these price increases and expanded margins due to its low-cost position in the industry. While we expect some softening in the wallboard industry due to reduced new residential construction, we consider Eagle Materials is currently materially undervalued, trading on 11x EV/EBIT, 12x PE and a 10% free cash flow yield.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cement and Construction Materials Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Momentum Stocks To Buy10 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy10 Best Video Conferencing Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 11 Best Cement and Construction Materials Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
372,5ad8213b-2b71-3e94-b793-d77e941cde01,CINF,2022-10-25,Earnings Preview: Cincinnati Financial (CINF) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-cincinnati-financial-cinf-140002456.html,1666620002,STORY,"['CINF', 'FAF']","[Cincinnati Financial (CINF) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.86 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -32.8%.Revenues are expected to be $2.06 billion, up 11.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cincinnati Financial?For Cincinnati Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -18.84%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cincinnati Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cincinnati Financial would post earnings of $1.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.65, delivering a surprise of -38.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cincinnati Financial doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, First American Financial (FAF), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -30.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.99 billion, down 22.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for First American Financial has been revised 11.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that First American Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The S&amp;P 500 has reclaimed about 8% from the trough of its Oct. 12 close.""There’s increasing discussion about a light at the end of the tunnel for Fed rate hikes,"" said Bill Merz, head of capital market research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. Merz also cautioned that it wouldn't be known for some time whether decades-high inflation was ""decisively headed toward the Fed’s target.""""We’re seeing a bit of a reprieve in the dollar and long-term bond yields have come down a little bit,"" Merz added. ""Those factors are combining to provide room for a bit of a rally.""After the bell, Microsoft and Alphabet delivered weaker than expected quarterly results, sending their shares down about 7%. That helped push S&amp;P 500 emini futures down almost 1%, suggesting traders expect the stock market to open deep in negative territory on Wednesday.Yields of 10-year Treasuries pulled pack on hopes that the Federal Reserve could begin easing its battle against inflation.A mixed brew of earnings and downbeat forecasts, usually a negative for markets, have suggested the barrage of interest rate hikes from the Fed is beginning to be felt, raising expectations that the central bank could pull back on the size of rate hikes after its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting.Data on Tuesday showed slowing home price growth and souring consumer confidence. Such signs of economic softness, ordinarily unsupportive of risk appetite, are evidence of abating Fed hawkishness.The financial market is nearly evenly split on whether the central bank's December rate increase will ease to 50 basis points after a string of 75 basis point hikes, according to CME's FedWatch tool.Story continuesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 337.12 points, or 1.07%, to 31,836.74, the S&amp;P 500 gained 61.77 points, or 1.63%, to 3,859.11 and the Nasdaq Composite added 246.50 points, or 2.25%, to 11,199.12.Among the 11 major sectors of the S&amp;P 500, all but energy posted gains on the day, with real estate enjoying the largest percentage gain.Third-quarter reporting season is firing on all pistons, with 129 of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported. Of those, 74% have beaten consensus expectations, according to Refinitiv.Analysts have set the bar low; aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings growth is now seen landing at 3.3% year-on-year, down from 4.5% at the beginning of the month, per Refinitiv.Coca-Cola Co rose 2.4% after the company upped its revenue and profit forecasts, banking on steady demand amid price increases.General Motors reaffirmed its outlook after posting solid earnings, sending its shares jumping 3.6%.On the downside, aerospace company Raytheon Technologies Corp posted a near 5% annual revenue increase, but its shares slid 1.5% on the company's trimmed sales outlook.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 120 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.89 billion shares, compared with the 11.57 billion average over the last 20 trading days.(Reporting by Stephen Culp; Additional reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru and Noel Randewich in Oakland, Calif.; editing by Grant McCool)]"

Its quarterly revenue also topped Wall Street's estimates.GE's shares were down about 1.8% at $72.02 in mid-day trade.The company, which is in the process of breaking up into three companies, is facing challenges at its onshore wind business. The unit, which is the largest of GE's renewable businesses, has been battling higher raw material costs due to inflation and supply-chain pressures.In the United States, which has been GE's most profitable onshore wind market, policy uncertainty following the expiry of renewable electricity production tax credits last year has hurt demand, contributing to a 15% year-on-year drop in renewable energy revenue in the September quarter.Chief Executive Larry Culp said onshore wind is ""the battleground"" for the company as it aims to make its renewable business profitable in 2024.Although the restoration of the tax credit for wind projects in the United States is expected to give a boost to demand in medium to long-term, GE expects renewable energy losses of about $2 billion this year.""Near term, customers continue to defer investments into the future,"" Chief Financial Officer Carolina Dybeck Happe said on earnings call.The company will reduce global headcount at its onshore wind unit by about 20% as part of a plan to restructure and resize the business. In an interview with Reuters, Culp said the cuts will take place over the next 12 months.The restructuring will also affect jobs at its renewable energy unit's headquarters, he said.As it prepares to split into three independent businesses, GE is looking to slash corporate costs. The company said corporate restructuring along with cuts at renewable energy business will cost $1.3 billion and generate $950 million in annualized savings.Story continuesGE said it is seeing ""early signs"" of improvement in supply-chain problems and is getting better at passing along the increased costs to customers.Still, supply-chain and macro pressures shaved off 4 percentage points from its overall revenue in the September quarter.GE reiterated that demand at its aviation unit is expected to remain strong, resulting in more than 20% revenue growth. The company reported double-digits increase in jet engine deliveries since the second quarter.The Boston-based industrial conglomerate now expects adjusted profit in 2022 in the range of $2.40 to $2.80 per share, compared with $2.80 to $3.50 estimated earlier.It reported an adjusted profit of 35 cents a share, lower than a profit of 53 cents a share last year. Excluding a $500 million warranty and related reserves at its renewable energy business, quarterly profit would have been 75 cents a share.Free cash flow in the September quarter came in at $1.19 billion, much higher than its previous estimate.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago and Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Sriraj Kalluvila, Nick Zieminski and Josie Kao)]"

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 159% in five years. We note the stock price is up 3.8% in the last seven days.Since the stock has added US$18b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, UnitedHealth Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 21% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, UnitedHealth Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 178%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that UnitedHealth Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 22% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 23% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand UnitedHealth Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

The second would be about work ethic - and how both are important to chase your dreams.William is an Aircraft Line Maintenance supervisor for American Airlines at Miami International Airport (MIA). He has been a part of the aviation industry for 42 years, with a firsthand view of how these big planes work and how he helps keep them safely in the air. Aviation is his passion, and he knows that his family and his hard work got him here.His interest in airplanes started when he was a kid. His parents, originally from Cuba, raised him in a friendly Cuban community in New Jersey. On the weekends, they would pack a picnic and head to the Newark Liberty International Airport observation deck to watch planes take off at sunset. ""Over time, I realized I wanted to be one of the guys on the ground that helps the planes take off,"" William said.William started his career with American in 2014, which sparked a love of planes for Maxine. ""I was in absolute awe of planes as a little girl - it was a whole other world that I knew I wanted to be a part of.""William instilled a strong work ethic in his children to tackle any challenges that might arise, values he said stemmed from their Cuban heritage. He encouraged them to reach for the stars, which helped fuel both kids' futures. Maxine and her brother, Dean took on extra courses and received college degrees while in high school - education was always first for the Rodriguez family.When Maxine was ready to decide on a career, she knew she wanted to follow in her dad's footsteps. ""I'm daddy's little girl. He's my idol, and I wanted to be just like him,"" she said. ""My dad taught us to achieve more, work hard and fast. I was ready to become a pilot, and I was ready to get started right away.""Story continuesMaxine decided she wanted a firsthand view of the flight deck and joined a local flight school with her proud dad supporting her every step of the journey. ""Every penny I saved went toward her flying lessons,"" he said. ""As long as she was willing to put in the work and persevere, I promised to be there for her.""The Rodriguez family lessons came into play again as Maxine navigated an uncharted course to be a pilot. As a young female minority, William knew Maxine's journey to becoming a pilot would require hard work, dedication and grit - all the characteristics he instilled in her from an early age.As Maxine started to build her hours and experience, she said she knew her ultimate goal was to fly for American. The first time her dad brought her to the MIA hangar, she recalls thinking to herself, ""Oh my, this is where I want to be - this is where I see myself, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get here.""Maxine was at a Women in Aviation event earlier this year when American offered her an on-the-spot interview and a job offer as a First Officer. ""I felt over the moon when I received the offer, and the tears just kept rolling… I couldn't believe it. I knew my hard work would eventually pay off, but I just felt extremely blessed and fortunate in that moment,"" she said.It was a long journey filled with many ups and down. At just 26, Maxine is one of the youngest female Hispanic pilots at American. And now that she has her wings, she hopes to mentor and inspire the next generation of girls to become pilots.""Being Latina in aviation is unfortunately pretty rare. I had a lot of hurdles, but my dad taught me tough love,"" she said. ""I know everyone doesn't have that same guidance, so I feel responsible to help lead the way. I now have little Latina girls looking up to me as a role model and I want them to hold on tight, because the view is worth it in the end.""She feels grateful and indebted to her dad for all the sacrifices he made to get her to where she is today. Maxine said that her dad is her greatest comfort and hopes to always stay by his side.The two live in Miami and are both based out of the MIA hub.

BG and Cardinal Health CAH.Check 5 Broker-Friendly Stocks for Returns Amid Market ChaosWith inflation remaining sky-high in the United States, markets have been gripped by extreme volatility this year so far. To combat the surging inflation in the country, the Fed adopted a hawkish stance. Per the latest available data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September 2022 was up 8.2% year over year.  The core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 6.6% year over year in September compared with 6.5% in August.As a result of this high reading, the Fed, which has already raised its core interest rate of 3% year to date, is likely to continue its interest-raising policy. Higher interest rates flare up the cost of borrowing, thus increasing the possibility of an economic slowdown.This gloomy scenario and the uncertain path ahead are well reflected in the double-digit year-to-date declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes. Despite the current turmoil, turning one's back on equities is never advisable. So what's the way forward?One way is to adhere to broker advice. Broker-friendly stocks like American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, CVR Energy, Bunge Ltd. and Cardinal Health are worth having a look at for healthy returns.Why Broker Advice is the Need of the HourIn the absence of proper guidance, individual investors may end up selecting wrong stocks for their portfolio. This might waste their hard-earned money, which they invested in the stock markets.As brokers indulge in extensive research on stocks under their coverage, they have access to much detailed information on a company. To this end, they attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every piece of document available in the public domain. After thorough research, brokers recommend (buy, sell or hold) a stock. Naturally, individual investors should avail of brokers' handy tips while designing a winning basket of stocks.Story continuesWinning StrategyThe above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and northward revisions of earnings estimates over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is included. The price/sales ratio takes care of a company's top line, making the strategy foolproof.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 10.9% upward. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, is based in Atlanta, GA. DAL is being bolstered by the uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). High fuel costs are, however, a bane.Delta's earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining two quarters). The average beat is 7.9%.CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high-value transportation fuels. CVI is also a producer of ammonia and urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers. CVI's petroleum business includes full-coking sour crude refinery in Coffeyville, KS. Its efforts to reward its shareholders underline its strong financial position.

392,3d3c17c6-901b-3d83-8002-f107e4de0748,AFL,2022-10-25,Earnings Preview: Aflac (AFL) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-aflac-afl-q3-140002461.html,1666620002,STORY,['AFL'],"[Aflac (AFL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.3%.Revenues are expected to be $4.63 billion, down 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.71% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aflac?For Aflac, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.21%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aflac will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aflac would post earnings of $1.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of +13.18%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Aflac doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

All comparisons are to the third quarter of the prior year, unless otherwise noted.SUMMARYConsolidated net sales increased 17.5% in the quarter to a record $6.05 billionDiluted net income per share increased to $2.62 per share in the quarter compared to $1.88 per share in the third quarter 2021Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) increased to $1.12 billion, or 18.6% of sales, in the quarterReaffirming FY22 diluted net income per share guidance in the range of $7.65 to $7.95 per share, including acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.85 per shareCEO REMARKS""Our team delivered record net sales results in the third quarter as we continued to focus on serving our customers with innovative solutions,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John G. Morikis. ""Sales grew to $6.05 billion, a 17.5% increase against a softer quarter comparison last year when raw material availability was highly challenged. Consolidated gross margin expanded 110 basis points sequentially and 120 basis points year-over-year to 42.8%. Our margins improved as a result of pricing actions across all businesses and volume increases in all architectural paint end markets in The Americas Group. We generated strong cash flow in the quarter, which enabled us to continue making strategic long-term investments across the business and pursue strategic, bolt-on acquisitions in the Performance Coatings Group, having closed three acquisitions since the beginning of the third quarter.""In The Americas Group, we continued to capture strong demand across all professional architectural markets, as same-store sales increased 20.7% in the third quarter, and we are seeing strong realization from our September 6th 10% price increase. In the Consumer Brands Group, double-digit growth in North America was partially offset by continued tightness in supply of alkyd resins and headwinds in Europe and Asia, while segment margin improved significantly sequentially and year-over-year. Momentum continues in the Pros Who Paint category with our North American retail partners. In the Performance Coatings Group, sales grew in every division as a result of pricing actions across all divisions and contributions from acquisitions. Regionally, sales were up strong double-digits in North America and Latin America, and high-single-digits in Asia, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Europe. Segment margin in this group also meaningfully expanded sequentially and year-over-year.""Story continues THIRD QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTSThree Months Ended September 30,20222021$ Change% ChangeNet sales$        6,047.4$        5,146.7$         900.717.5 %Income before income taxes$         877.2$         611.5$         265.743.5 %As a % of sales14.5 %11.9 %Net income per share - diluted$          2.62$          1.88$           0.7439.4 %Adjusted net income per share - diluted$          2.83$          2.09$           0.7435.4 %Consolidated net sales increased primarily due to selling price increases in all segments and higher architectural sales volume in The Americas Group, partially offset by lower sales volume in the Consumer Brands Group.

Acquisitions closed over the past twelve months diluted adjusted segment margin by 60 basis points.LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWThe Company generated $1.28 billion in net operating cash during the first nine months of 2022. This cash generation, along with an increase in our short-term borrowings and long-term debt, allowed the Company to return cash of approximately $1.21 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, and close five acquisitions through the first nine months of the year. The Company purchased 2.75 million shares of its common stock during the first nine months. At September 30, 2022, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 45.8 million shares of its common stock through open market purchases.2022 GUIDANCEFourth QuarterFull Year20222022Net salesUp high-single to low-double digit %Up low-double digit %Effective tax rateLow twenty percentDiluted net income per share$7.65-$7.95Adjusted diluted net income per share (1)$8.50-$8.80(1) Excludes $0.85 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense. ""We expect the strong positive results we experienced in the third quarter to continue into the fourth quarter, driven by continued momentum in both The Americas Group and North American industrial end markets, continued price realization, good cost control, and softer year-over-year comparisons,"" said Mr. Morikis. ""We expect fourth quarter consolidated net sales to increase by a high-single to low-double digit percentage and full year consolidated net sales to increase by a low-double digit percentage. Full year adjusted diluted net income per share guidance remains in the range of $8.50 - $8.80 per share, which represents mid-single digit percentage growth from 2021 at the mid-point. This implies a 35% increase in the second half of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 as we have been expecting, in what continues to be a challenging macro environment.""We have an experienced and long-tenured management team who has faced numerous challenges through many different operating cycles. In the near term, our team continues to remain focused on new account growth, share of wallet initiatives and managing expenses tightly, given interest rate actions designed to slow U.S. demand and the expectation of continued macro headwinds in Europe and China into next year. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we will take actions to simplify our operating model and portfolio of products sold in the Consumer Brands Group and weigh various options to implement appropriate cost reduction plans in all regions in the Performance Coatings Group, the Consumer Brands Group, and the Administrative segments due to the continued uncertain demand outlook. The trajectory of raw material costs is trending favorably as we exit the year, although the pace and level of potential relief next year is difficult to project.""Our long-term outlook remains bright. We will continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives, including stores, sales representatives, innovative products and acquisitions that fit our strategy. We remain confident in our strategy, our capabilities and solutions, and most importantly, our people, who have demonstrated a consistent ability to execute and outperform the market regardless of the economic environment.""CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATIONThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter, and its outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, at 11:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, October 25, 2022.

395,bc346b92-3916-3c39-8d17-1e248a82d5f6,SHW,2022-10-25,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell Before It’s Too Late,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-sell-014743619.html,1666403263,STORY,['SHW'],"[As the bear market rages on, many investors have turned to blue-chip stocks to find safe harbor. Yet, while many blue-chips could add stability and safety to your portfolio (making them stocks to buy), there are plenty of such companies that are best-considered stocks to sell.This is mostly due to valuation concerns. Prior to this year, scores of “dividend aristocrat” blue-chips surged higher, as low interest rates made these high-quality income stocks more appealing to investors. This resulted in several of these stocks to surge to valuations that appear to be potentially unsustainable. That’s because the Federal Reserve remains intent on raising interest rates, leading to the possibility that interest rates may remain at levels not seen in over a decade.Along with multiple compression, there are other factors such as deteriorating fundamentals, that could take some blue-chip stocks lower.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese seven blue-chips stocks to sell aren’t necessarily headed to the graveyard. That said, for those looking to avoid future frustrating and underwhelming returns, it may pay to skip out on these stocks right now.CLXClorox$136.25EDConsolidated Edison$84.87KOCoca-Cola$55.96MMM3M$116.81MSFTMicrosoft$242.12SHWSherwin Williams$207.82WMTWalmart$136.80Clorox (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comStarting out our list of blue-chip stocks to sell is Clorox (NYSE:CLX). This company may be down more than 40% from the lofty price levels it reached during 2020. However, the company’s substantially lower stock price fails to make this venerable consumer staples stock a bargain. At current prices, shares trade for around 32.8-times estimated earnings for the current fiscal year (ending June 2023).That means CLX stock trades at a substantial premium to peers such as Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Unilever (NYSE:UL), which trade for 21.8-times and 18.2-times earnings, respectively.Story continuesYes, sell-side consensus calls for a greater level of earnings growth for CLX than for either PG or UL. However, per analysts at Evercore ISI, various competitive challenges could lead Clorox to fall short of expectations. Disappointing results could potentially send CLX down to a valuation more in line with comparable names. This makes it one of the blue-chip stocks to sell in my books.Consolidated Edison (ED)Con Edison electricity gas and steam power company truck vehicle van parked on Manhattan street.Source: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.comConsolidated Edison (NYSE:ED), best known to its customers as “Con Ed,” is the largest utility company in New York City. Con Ed provides electric and gas to millions of homes and businesses throughout America’s largest metropolitan area.With a deep economic moat, and in a recession-resistant business, ED stock (like other utilities stocks) looked very appealing to investors earlier this year when the stock market downturn first took shape. From January to September, shares moved higher, even as stocks broadly trended lower. Unfortunately, this resiliency has come to an end.The specter of continued interest rate hikes has put pressure on utilities stocks, including ED stock. Accordingly, despite this pullback, ConEd could keep sliding. With a forward earnings multiple of 18.5-times, Con Ed trades at a premium to peers like Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK), and Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC), which each trade for around 16-times earnings.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is the quintessential blue-chip stock. Shares have also long been a Warren Buffett favorite, with Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) holding it in its portfolio for nearly 35 years.With this in mind, it may seem odd at first to consider KO one of the blue-chip stocks to sell. That said, while the soft drink giant has long provided investors steady returns through price appreciation and dividends, future returns for KO stock could be far more underwhelming.KO’s valuation (22.5-times earnings) could come under more pressure, as the company is set to deliver sluggish revenue (2.9%) and earnings growth (3.7%) next year. The end of near-zero interest rates also means Coca-Cola’s 3.2% dividend no longer seems as high-yield as it once did. Down modestly (7.1%) year-to-date, the market could continue to bid down the stock, until it reaches a less-aggressive valuation.3M (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.comTrading for just 11-times earnings, and yielding 5.27%, why is 3M (NYSE:MMM) a blue-chip to sell? Indeed, the industrial conglomerate’s shares may be far cheaper than the stocks we’ve discussed so far, and have already taken a big plunge year-to-date.That said, I think a further sell-off may lie ahead.Why? Well, macro factors have played a role in the decline of MMM stock in 2022, but the main factor has been the company’s legal troubles. 3M is fighting litigation related to both its past sale of military earplugs, as well as its past manufacture of PFAS chemicals.This litigation could continue to drag on MMM’s returns. It may also result in a dividend cut, making the stock a potential yield trap. While attempting to lighten an estimated $33 billion in liabilities (per Bloomberg Law), the company’s game plan to lessen the blow has failed to achieve success thus far.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comDown around 30% since the start of 2022, is now a good time to load up on tech blue-chip Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)? Not so fast, at least, according to research firm Hedgeye. Earlier this month, Hedgeye’s Ami Joseph laid out his bear case for the software and cloud computing giant.In a nutshell, Joseph argues that MSFT stock is pricey when taking into account future growth. Furthermore, the analyst believes that competition from Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS platform will result in growth for Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform to fall short of Wall Street estimates.After sliding following the release of this bear case, MSFT has started to bounce back in recent trading days. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean Joseph has made the wrong call. If Microsoft’s upcoming earnings release (on Oct. 25) falls short of expectations, another big pullback for the stock may be in store.Sherwin-Williams (SHW)A Sherwin-Williams (SHW) sign in Richfield, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWith the 2021 housing boom possibly morphing into a 2023 housing bust, sentiment for Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) has already shifted. With investors moving from bulls to bears, shares have already dropped around 40% since January.The paint giant appears reasonably priced relative to next year’s earnings projections ($10.29 per share). Based on this forecast, SHW stock currently trades for less than 20-times earnings, at the lower end of its historic earnings multiple range. However, it’s very possible the company fails to hit these estimates.As a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, management may have to again cut guidance, due to weakness in not only the U.S. market, but also overseas in Europe and China. If demand for its products continues to weaken, Sherwin-Williams may have a ways to go before truly bottoming out. Keep this in mind, if you were thinking of “buying the dip.”Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAfter tanking last May, alongside other retailer peers, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shares have made a partial recovery in recent months. That said, while it may seem as if the big box giant’s shares have already bottomed-out, it’s possible the stock pulls back instead of moves higher from here.Analyst forecasts call for single-digit sales and earnings growth. This makes WMT stock appear pricey, at around 23-times earnings. In today’s rising rate environment, it may prove difficult for its multiple to expand. Also, it’s important to note that as recently as 2017, this stock traded at an earnings multiple in the mid-teens.With growth slowing down, despite its big push into e-commerce, a move back to such a valuation may be justified. Even if Walmart doesn’t fall back to its past earnings multiple, a partial compression of its valuation could still result in a double-digit drop for shares.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

397,9aee7cc2-8cfa-39fa-8480-9026f2efe16d,UHS,2022-10-25,4 Stocks Navigating Through Hospital Industry Headwinds (Revised),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-navigating-hospital-industry-081308492.html,1666685588,STORY,"['HCA', 'THC', 'ACHC', 'UHS', '^GSPC']","[The hospital space is currently fighting labor shortage, inflation and resultant escalated operating expenses. Even though revenues are increasing, growing salaries and benefits are eating up Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players’ margins. Surplus supply and stiff competition are other major headwinds. However, the resumption of non-essential procedures stimulated a recovery in patient volumes. Rising outpatient surgeries and patient days are boosting hospital players’ operations. Also, technological improvements and adoptions are lowering hospitals' treatment costs. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. ACHC, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS and Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC are set to benefit from these developments.About the Industry The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care, and diagnostic and emergency services, among others. Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.4 Trends Deciding the Industry's FateRising Costs: Hospital companies are facing high salaries, wages and benefits, and increasing operating expenses due to inflation, which are eroding margins. Investments in growth projects will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. Even though labor shortages are expected to keep creating headaches for the industry players, the situation is expected to improve in the coming days. Also, the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Story continuesRecovering Volumes: Demand for elective procedures will likely drive patient volumes as the intensity of COVID-related headwinds keeps decreasing. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. Nonetheless, financial constraints are forcing patients to delay addressing non-emergency medical needs, as found in a survey by Discover Personal Loans, which can be a major headwind. Discover Personal Loans stated that 31% of Americans with medical debt are holding back doctor-recommended treatments.Growth in the Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare are enabling the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau’s revised report suggests that individuals aged above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers.Technological Improvements: Technological innovations, improvements and wider adoption will be a major theme in the hospital space. The trend should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and enhance the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future. The industry players are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that are utilized by hospitals. The companies are using the virtual health domain to heighten their efficiency by limiting the patients’ waiting time and trimming their treatment costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 18% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have decreased 16.1% in the past year. Given the lackluster near-term prospects, companies in the space are expected to take a hit.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; Sector The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 17.7% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 19.1% and the Zacks Medical sector’s decrease of 22.4%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 7.70X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.40X and the sector’s 7.66X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 8.75X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.74X as the charts below show.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past 5 Years)4 Stocks to Watch ForWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. HCA’s inorganic growth strategies have led to increased patient volumes, network expansion across several markets and more hospitals in its portfolio. The company has been gaining from its telemedicine business line. HCA Healthcare also focuses on boosting shareholders’ value with dividend hikes and buybacks.HCA expects current-year revenues in the band of $59.5-$61.5 billion, the mid-point of which indicates a rise of 3% from the 2021 figure. Given the current situation, profits are expected to continue increasing on the back of admissions. HCA beat earnings estimates twice in the past four quarters and missed on two occasions, the average surprise being 5%. Shares of the company have jumped 5.2% in the past month.Price &amp; Consensus: HCAAcadia Healthcare: ACHC provides behavioral healthcare services in the United States and Puerto Rico. It has been emphasizing on acquisitions for expedited growth. Buyouts added facilities, beds and hospitals to Acadia Healthcare’s network and contributed to its top line. It is also actively pursuing JVs with renowned healthcare systems, which is helping it expand its capabilities through bed additions. The year 2022 is likely to be its strongest year in terms of JVs. Its moves to streamline its portfolio to boost efficiency and profitability are also noteworthy.Acadia Healthcare expects current-year revenues in the band of $2.56-$2.60 billion, indicating an increase from the 2021 level of $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be $583-$613 million, implying an increase from $558.7 million in 2021. Adjusted earnings per share are forecast within $2.93-$3.18, calling for a rise from the 2021 level of $2.56. ACHC beat on earnings twice in the last four quarters, met the mark once and missed estimates on another occasion, the average surprise being 3.5%. Shares of ACHC have increased 0.7% in the past month.Price &amp; Consensus: ACHCUniversal Health Services: UHS focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. This segment holds immense scope for growth in the days ahead, considering the dire need to address behavioral health issues triggered by the pandemic. Universal Health’s plans to add new capacities in hospitals in important markets of Texas and California to address strong acute care demand are major positives. Earlier this year, the board of directors decided to increase its share buyback plan by $1.4 billion.Universal Health expects net revenues for 2022 within $13,235-$13,371 million, indicating an increase from $12,642.1 million a year ago. The company expects adjusted earnings per share for this year in the range of $9.60 to $10.40. UHS beat earnings estimates twice in the past four quarters and missed on the other occasions. Shares of the company have risen 0.4% in the past month.Price &amp; Consensus: UHSTenet Healthcare Corporation: THC, with its subsidiaries, provides healthcare services, primarily through general hospitals and related healthcare facilities. The company has made several buyouts, partnerships and strategic alliances to augment the scale of business, operating capacity and geographical presence. Its performance has been stimulated by USPI Holding Company’s (Ambulatory Care) operations.For the current year, THC’s net operating revenues are anticipated within $19-$19.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is still anticipated within $3,375-$3,575 million, suggesting 6% growth from the last year’s reported figure. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, the average surprise being 87.4%.

(NYSE:AWK) institutional owners after losing 23% over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-american-151010254.html,1666624210,STORY,['AWK'],"[Every investor in American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 88% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week's US$785m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 23% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of American Water Works Company, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for American Water Works Company ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Water Works Company?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in American Water Works Company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at American Water Works Company's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in American Water Works Company. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.0% and 5.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 18 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of American Water Works CompanyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that American Water Works Company, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$44m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over American Water Works Company. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for American Water Works Company   (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

399,bf9972c7-b469-39ae-894a-a1dac13e1593,AWK,2022-10-25,Earnings Preview: American Water Works (AWK) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-american-water-works-140002626.html,1666620002,STORY,"['AWK', 'CWT']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when American Water Works (AWK) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis water utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.02 billion, down 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.87% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Water Works?For American Water Works, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American Water Works will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Water Works would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.20, delivering a surprise of +5.26%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Water Works doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerCalifornia Water Service Group (CWT), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.16 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -3.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $255 million, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for California Water Service Group has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.59%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that California Water Service Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sales are slowing down in key market China, due to pricing pressure.Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of the Q3 earnings release on November 10th. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.

The Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment.

You can skip our detailed analysis of European dividend stocks and their returns, and go directly to read 5 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. After a pandemic-related slump in global dividend payments, companies around the world raised and reinstated their dividends to a record level. Dividends in Europe and the US fell by $100 billion in 2020 but recovered as soon as the market regained its footing last year. This year’s returns of European dividend stocks show their superior performance to their counterparts. The AlphaDEX European Dividend Index, which tracks the performance of Europe-domiciled dividend companies, reported a decline of 18.5% in 2022 so far, versus a 21.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of October 21.In its second quarter 2022 global dividend report, Janus Henderson Investors mentioned that the UK and Europe were the main driving forces in the global payout surge. Dividends in Europe grew by 28.7% on an underlying basis, amounting to $165.8 billion. The report also mentioned that special dividends paid by European companies also grew by 2.5% in Q2, from the previous quarter. Another report by Forbes cited the data of Henderson International Income Trust, which mentioned that dividends from UK companies will head for record payments this year for the first time since 2008. This growth will be attributed to rising oil prices that have significantly contributed to the growing revenues of many companies in the FTSE 100. With the global surge in dividend stocks this year, companies like Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) are gaining ground among investors due to their solid dividend policies.According to analysts, Europe’s recovering stock market has a lot to offer to investors in terms of dividends and capital gains. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs analyst Guillaume Jaisson spoke to Bloomberg about European dividend equities. He said that high-yielding stocks in Europe have started to outperform as they are less sensitive to rising bond yields. He further mentioned that dividends in Stoxx Europe 600 Index are expected to grow by 10% this year, mainly driven by energy and bank stocks.Story continues10 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: samranwara31 / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are European businesses that pay dividends to shareholders.

ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”9.

The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient.

We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multi-national companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best European Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Video Conferencing Stocks To Invest In10 Cheap Value Stocks To Buy12 Small Cap Ecommerce Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Interest in bonds is increasing as Treasury yields rise. Aggressive rate hikes to control inflation have pushed the S&amp;P 500 into bear territory, and investor sentiment is quite pessimistic as the benchmark S&amp;P 500 has declined about 22% year-to-date as of October 22. According to Ned Davis Research, a rally in the stock market in 2023 will not be sustainable unless traders do not abandon their investments amid a bear market. NDR's proprietary trading sentiment composite suggests that the market is in ""extreme pessimism"" territory, with bearish responses nearing 60% of market participants. The research firm noted:""Sentiment would need to remain subdued, providing a wall of worry for the market to climb...A quick jump from pessimism to optimism would signal the rally may have run its course."" Investors seeking safe and solid positions for their portfolios can take a look at firms like Visa Inc.

Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever that can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”9.

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information.

Cisco Systems (CSCO) earns a Zacks Rank #3 23 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 16, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.85 a share.Cisco Systems' Earnings ESP sits at 1.46%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.85 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.84.CSCO is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is AT&amp;T (T).AT&amp;T, which is readying to report earnings on January 25, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.
