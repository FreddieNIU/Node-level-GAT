For the quarter, the RiverPark Large Growth Fund (the “Fund”) lost 3.3% - a bit better than the S&amp;P 500 (-4.9% for the quarter) and about in line with the Russell 1000 Growth index (-3.6% for the quarter). Try to spare some time to check the fund's top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, RiverPark Large Growth Fund mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1971, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a Westlake, Texas-based multinational financial services company with a $134.1 billion market capitalization. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) delivered a -13.84% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -12.76%. The stock closed at $72.46 per share on October 25, 2022.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""SCHW reported solid 2Q business metrics in July, with revenue up 13% year over year, and net income up 42% year over year. Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come. Moreover, the combination of steadily rising short-term rates (which should benefit net interest income), plus acquisition synergies from the AMTD deal, gives us confidence that SCHW is poised to generate continued double-digit earnings growth for the foreseeable future.""Story continuesBest bank stocks for 2021Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comOur calculations show that The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) fell short and didn’t make it on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Sequentially, continued momentum in capacity enterprise drives sold to U.S. cloud customers and an increase in smart video hard drives demand partly offset the decline in all other hard drive product channels and flash. The year-over-year decrease was due to broad-based decline across both hard drive and flash products.Client represented 33% of total revenue. Sequentially, the decline was attributed to flash, driven by inventory reduction at PC OEMs and lower pricing. The year-over-year decrease resulted primarily from reduced flash pricing.Consumer represented 18% of revenue. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the revenue decline was due to flash pricing and lower retail HDD shipments.Business Outlook for Fiscal Second Quarter of 2023Three Months EndingDecember 30, 2022GAAP(1)Non-GAAP(1)Revenue ($B)$2.90 - $3.10$2.90 - $3.10Gross margin19.5% - 21.5%20.0% - 22.0%Operating expenses ($M)$760 - $780$650 - $670Interest and other expense, net ($M)~$80~$80Tax benefit ($M)(2)N/A$70 - $90Diluted earnings per shareN/A$(0.25) - $0.05Diluted shares outstanding (in millions)~319~319(1) Non-GAAP gross margin guidance excludes stock-based compensation expense of approximately $10 million to $15 million. The company’s Non-GAAP operating expenses guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, totaling approximately $100 million to $120 million. In the aggregate, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance excludes these items totaling $110 million to $135 million. The timing and amount of these charges excluded from Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share cannot be further allocated or quantified with certainty. Additionally, the timing and amount of additional charges the company excludes from its Non-GAAP tax benefit and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are dependent on the timing and determination of certain actions and cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, full reconciliations of Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, Non-GAAP tax benefit and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures (income tax benefit and diluted earnings per share, respectively) are not available without unreasonable effort.(2) The Non-GAAP tax benefit in dollars is determined based on a percentage of Non-GAAP pre-tax income or loss. Due to differences in the tax treatment of items excluded from our Non-GAAP net income; the fact that our GAAP tax expense or benefit in dollars recorded in any interim period is based on an estimated forecasted GAAP tax rate for the full year, excluding loss jurisdictions; and because our GAAP taxes recorded in any interim period are dependent on the timing and determination of certain GAAP operating expenses, our estimated Non-GAAP tax dollars may differ from our GAAP tax dollars.Investor CommunicationsThe investment community conference call to discuss these results and the company’s business outlook for the fiscal second quarter of 2023 will be broadcast live online today at 5:30 a.m. Pacific/8:30 a.m. Eastern.

These Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from Non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The company believes the presentation of these Non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors for measuring the company’s earnings performance and comparing it against prior periods. Specifically, the company believes these Non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors as they exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results or because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the company and its peers. As discussed further below, these Non-GAAP measures exclude, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, contamination related charges, employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, non-cash economic interest, other adjustments, and income tax adjustments, and the company believes these measures along with the related reconciliations to the GAAP measures provide additional detail and comparability for assessing the company's results. These Non-GAAP measures are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing the company's performance and planning and forecasting future periods. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.As described above, the company excludes the following items from its Non-GAAP measures:Stock-based compensation expense. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the company's control, the company believes excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the company's peers, a majority of whom also exclude stock-based compensation expense from their Non-GAAP results.Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company incurs expenses from the amortization of acquired intangible assets over their economic lives. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the company's acquisitions and any related impairment charges.Contamination related charges. In February 2022, a contamination of certain materials used in the company's manufacturing process occurred and affected production operation at the flash-based memory manufacturing facilities in Yokkaichi and Kitakami, Japan, which are operated through the company's joint business ventures with Kioxia Corporation (collectively, ""Flash Ventures""). The contamination resulted in scrapped inventory and rework costs, decontamination and other costs needed to restore the facilities to normal capacity, and under absorption of overhead costs, which are expensed as incurred. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and the company believes these charges are not part of the ongoing production operation of its business.Employee termination, asset impairment and other charges. From time-to-time, in order to realign the company's operations with anticipated market demand or to achieve cost synergies from the integration of acquisitions, the company may terminate employees and/or restructure its operations. From time-to-time, the company may also incur charges from the impairment of intangible assets and other long-lived assets. In addition, the company may record credits related to gains upon sale of property due to restructuring or reversals of charges recorded in prior periods. These charges or credits are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and the company believes they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business.Non-cash economic interest. The company excludes non-cash economic interest expense associated with its convertible notes. These charges do not reflect the company's operating results, and the company believes they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business.Other adjustments. From time-to-time, the company incurs charges or gains that the company believes are not a part of the ongoing operation of its business. The resulting expense or benefit is inconsistent in amount and frequency.Income tax adjustments. Income tax adjustments include the difference between income taxes based on a forecasted annual Non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax rate as a result of the timing of certain Non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments. The income tax adjustments also include adjustments to estimates related to the current status of the rules and regulations governing the transition to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the re-measurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to tax positions taken in prior quarters, including interest. These adjustments are excluded because the company believes that they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its ongoing business.Additionally, free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, net, and the activity related to Flash Ventures, net. The company considers free cash flow generated in any period to be a useful indicator of cash that is available for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the company's business, making strategic acquisitions, repaying debt and strengthening the balance sheet.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221026006026/en/ContactsWestern Digital Corp.Investor Contact: T.

Here's what the firm said:“We had the opportunity to purchase BorgWarner for a high single-digit multiple of our estimate of normal earnings due to elevated cyclical concerns and uncertainty about the longer term impact of powertrain electrification on the business. Currently, the company’s earnings are depressed due to semiconductor supply constraints that are impacting the entire industry. We expect these constraints to prove transitory, and we’re confident that component shortages will be resolved in the coming years. Furthermore, we believe that OEMs are likely to rely heavily on third-party suppliers, like BorgWarner, to leverage R&amp;D expenses to enhance innovation and speed-to-market in an electrified world. For decades, we’ve been impressed with how BorgWarner management has successfully acquired and scaled fuel efficiency technologies for internal combustion engines. We see strong parallels and underappreciated potential in the acquisitions the company has made over the past 5+ years in key electric vehicle technologies. We believe the company is well-positioned to manufacture and integrate new propulsion systems and components to meet customer demands.”BorgWarner Inc.

""The life science industry, exemplified by our irreplicable roster of over 1,000 tenants, works tirelessly to address the 10,000 known diseases that affect us all, nearly 90% of which have no approved treatments. It is a tremendous honor to serve on the Prix Galien's esteemed awards jury as we celebrate the industry's most impactful medicines and products that are critical to meeting this massive unmet medical need.""In close collaboration with the Galien Foundation, Alexandria has made a distinctive impact on the annual Galien Forum and played a strategic role in its programming since the forum debuted in New York City in 2010. Over the past decade, Alexandria has curated and presented important panels featuring world-class subject matter experts to stimulate new approaches to the most important issues facing human health, including exploring how disruptive innovation can positively impact healthcare costs, the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the lifesaving role of an essential industry, as well as combating the devastating opioid crisis in America. This year, the company will present a timely conversation about the country's mental health crisis, featuring Patrick J. Kennedy, former congressman, founder of The Kennedy Forum, and one of the world's leading voices and policymakers on mental health. Co-moderated by Mr. Marcus and Alexandria's chief of science, Lynne Zydowsky, PhD, the discussion will explore critical issues, strategies and policies aimed at driving meaningful progress and revolutionizing the way mental illness is understood and treated. Each year in the United States, an estimated 1 in 5 adults will experience mental illness and 1 in 6 youth aged 6–17 will experience a mental health disorder, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Alexandria is addressing this persistent, widespread crisis, with a particular focus on helping children cope with suicide loss, through one of its eight social responsibility pillars.""Now more than ever, it is our collective responsibility to normalize a national dialogue around mental health and do what it takes to increase access to care,"" said Mr. Kennedy. ""It is a privilege to work closely with Alexandria, whose incredible initiative and partnership are instrumental in our efforts to build a more equitable, integrated healthcare system that embraces the body and the mind. We must bolster provider networks and scale and mobilize resources like never before to treat mental illness on the same level that we treat other illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease and, most recently, COVID-19. After all, there is no health without mental health. It's time to empower all Americans — especially our youth — from the inside out.""Alexandria aligns every aspect of its mission-driven business and visionary social responsibility efforts to advance human health and enhance the quality of people's lives. The company is steadfastly working to address some of society's most pressing issues through its eight core social responsibility pillars: (1) disease and other threats to human health and well-being, (2) hunger and food insecurity, (3) opioid addiction, (4) deficiencies in support services for the military and their families, (5) disparities in educational and character-building opportunities, (6) homelessness, (7) the loss of our nation's historical memory and (8) the mental health and suicide crisis.About Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

The company delivered an earnings surprise of 55.28% in the last reported quarter.Factors to NoteThe Unum U.S. segment is likely to have benefited from higher premium levels in the employee benefits lines, individual disability and voluntary benefits, growth in the in-force block, solid persistency, and growth in the dental and vision product line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter premium income at the Unum U.S. segment is pegged at $4.1 billion, implying an improvement of 4.1% from the prior-year reported figure. We expect premium to increase 3.5% to $1.6 billion.Improvement in mortality rates is likely to have favored Unum US Group Life and AD&amp;D business.Continued higher persistency, higher sales and favorable incidence in all the product lines and management’s focus on moving on to a mix of businesses with higher growth and stable margins likely have favored performance at Colonial Life. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter premium income at the Colonial Life segment stands at $433 million, indicating an increase of 2.9% from the prior-year level. We estimate premium to rise 1.8% to $428.4 million.Growth in the in-force block, resulting from the impact of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line, and higher persistency are likely to have benefited Unum International in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter premium income at the Unum International segment stands at $178 million. We estimate premium to rise 6.2% to $192.9 million.A lower level of invested assets and a decrease in the yield on invested assets are likely to have weighed on net investment income. This downside may have been partially offset by higher miscellaneous investment income related to private equity partnerships as well as an improvement in interest rate. UNM estimates income from alternatives in the $20 million to $25 million range in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $520 million, indicating a 5.5% decline from the prior-year quarter. We expect net investment income to be $519.9 million.Expenses are likely to have decreased due to lower benefits and change in reserves for future benefits, partially offset by higher interest and debt expense, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other expenses. We expect total benefits and expenses to rise 4.5% to $2.7 billion.A continued share buyback is likely to have provided a boost to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.40, indicating an increase of 35.9% from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate for third-quarter EPS is $1.41.Story continuesQuantitative Model PredictionOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Unum Group this time around.

15,1146646e-6088-314f-a662-18253dc411b8,STT,2022-10-27,Jim Cramer Gives These 2 Stocks His Stamp of Approval,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-gives-2-stocks-142909399.html,1666794549,STORY,"['CMI', 'STT']","[Markets are rewriting the same story we’ve been looking at all summer – investors are skittish, and wary of the headwinds. Those headwinds are enough to spook even the most experienced traders. High inflation is making everyone nervous, the Fed’s turn to higher interest rates – to combat inflation – brings with it the risk of recession, and macro data on the economy is starting to show declines in the housing markets and consumer confidence and spending. As if all that wasn’t enough, now add in the national election coming up on November 8, and it’s a recipe for trouble.But as usual, with trouble comes opportunity. Jim Cramer, the well-known host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money’ program, has never been one to shy away from a turbulent market, and he has a knack for finding solid stocks that can support an investment portfolio pending better times down the road. Right now, Cramer sees the trading world in something of a holding pattern, saying, “The market needs time to adjust, and the Fed doesn’t want to rock the boat too aggressively right before the election.”Cramer is well-known for the ‘lightning round’ feature on his program, where he gives his short takes to callers’ stock questions. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up the details on a couple of his recent bullish calls. Let’s take a look at the data and the analyst commentary, and find out why Cramer thinks lightning will strike.State Street Corporation (STT)Boston-based State Street makes a unique boast: it is the second-oldest bank in the United States, tracing its roots back to 1792. Today, with $3.3 trillion in total assets under management, along with $35.7 trillion in assets under custody, the company is also one of the largest asset managers on the global scene. State Street reported $11.16 billion in revenues last year, and is well on its way to beating that total this year.On October 18, the company reported its results for 3Q22, showing $2.96 billion at the top line, along with net income of $690 million. STT’s diluted EPS came in at $1.80. State Street reported decreases in its overall fee revenues, including servicing fees and management fees; these were partly offset by increases in fees for forex trading, securities finance, and software and processing. Net interest income was up 36%. These results were considered mostly in-line with expectations.Story continuesThat performance is holding up a dividend of 63 cents per common share. At an annualized rate of $2.52, the dividend is yielding 3.47%.Looking at State Street’s financial performance compared to its share price – the latter is down 20% so far this year – Jim Cramer says of STT: “I think State Street down here at this level is a terrific buy.”5-star analyst Stephen Biggar, covering State Street from Argus, agrees that the stock is one to buy. Laying out the case, he writes, “We expect State Street to benefit from several long-term earnings drivers. First, asset managers are facing cost pressures that will likely lead to the further outsourcing of back-office operations. Second, the company has scale advantages, and should see improved operating leverage over time. Third, asset managers must focus on their core competency (managing money) and not on more-mundane servicing tasks...""""We believe that recent weakness provides a favorable entry point for the high-quality STT shares,"" Biggar summed up.Standing squarely in the bull camp, Biggar rates STT a Buy, and his $88 price target suggests an upside of ~21% over the coming year. (To watch Biggar’s track record, click here)It would seem that, for the most part, Wall Street is in agreement with both Biggar and Cramer. The 10 recent analyst reviews include 7 Buys and 3 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating, and the $79.60 average price target implies ~10% gain from the current trading price of $72.48. (See STT stock forecast on TipRanks)Cummins, Inc. (CMI)The second stock we’ll look at is Cummins, a major name in engineering, best known as a supplier of engines and ancillary components for heavy industrial vehicles. Cummins operates through several segments, offering engines, engine and drive train components, and power generation systems. The company has a global presence, with over 9,000 locations worldwide, and offers full mechanical and maintenance support to its customers.A few numbers will give the scale of Cummins’ ops. The company has more than 58,000 employees, and its revenues are in the tens of billions. The top line hit $19.8 billion in 2020, and in 2021 that rose to $24 billion. So far this year, Cummins has reported results for Q1 and Q2; its first half revenue is up 6.3% from 1H21.Digging into the Q2 report, we find that Cummins had earnings of $702 million, with a diluted EPS of $4.94. International revenues slipped 2% in Q2, but that was more than compensated by North American revenues, which grew 15%. Overall, Cummins reported a top line of $6.6 billion for the quarter. This was up 8% year-over-year, and was in-line with the company’s overall forward guidance; Cummins is expecting a full-year revenue gain of 8% over 2021.Looking at Cummins, Jim Cramer is impressed by the company’s status as a stalwart of the industrial engineering world, an essential sector of the modern economy. He writes of Cummins, “I think Cummins is a great company. This is the kind of stock that is working right now in this environment. It doesn’t really get hurt much by rates. It’s got superior products [that] it’s selling all over the world. I like Cummins.”Cowen analyst Matt Elkot would agree. The 5-star analyst covers CMI, and looking at the company, ahead of Q3 earnings (November 3), he sees several reasons for optimism going forward.“We are positive on CMI into the print... Chips have gotten a bit more stable, and the company has become a little less worried on the issue... Demand environment remains strong. September truck orders came in a lot higher than expected... Backlogs for medium-duty trucks remain robust, and demand may last longer than demand for heavy-duty trucks,"" Elkot noted.To this end, Elkot gives Cummins an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and backs it with a $267 price target that indicates potential for a 13.5% share growth by the end of next year. (To watch Elkot’s track record, click here)What does the rest of the Street think? Looking at the consensus breakdown, opinions from other analysts are more spread out. The stock has 11 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 5 Buys and 6 Holds for a Moderate Buy consensus view. With an average price target of $249.36 and a trading price of $235.28, Cummins has a one-year potential upside of about 6%.

The figure however declined 12% year over year.The adjusted number excludes certain non-recurring expenses, including asset amortization costs and certain restructuring costs.GAAP EPS was $3.79, reflecting a 20.9% drop on a year-over-year basis.Revenues in DetailRevenues in the quarter under review grossed $10.68 billion, up 14% year over year. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.3%.Segment DetailsOrganic revenues in the reported quarter declined 1% year over year, while currency translation lowered revenues by 5%. Products added with acquisitions drove revenues higher by 20%. Core organic revenue growth (considering the impact of PPD revenue, excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing revenue) was 14%.Thermo Fisher operates under four business segments — Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services.Revenues at the Life Sciences Solutions segment (27.7% of total revenues) declined 20.4% year over year to $2.96 billion, while Analytical Instruments Segment sales (15.2%) improved 9.8% to $1.62 billion.Revenues at the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment (52.3%) rose 60.2% to $5.59 billion.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. QuoteThe adjusted operating margin for the quarter came in at 22.2%, reflecting a contraction of 760 bps.Story continuesFinancial PositionThe company exited the third quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.92 billion compared with $1.89 billion at the end of Q2.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities was $5.67 billion compared with $6.86 billion a year ago.Thermo Fisher has a consistent dividend-paying history, with the five-year annualized dividend growth being 15.4%.GuidanceThe company stated that it would come up with its updated 2022 financial guidance on its earnings conference call.Our TakeThermo Fisher exited the third quarter with better-than-expected results. The robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.Zacks Rank and Key PicksThermo Fisher currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Elevance Health, Inc.

This compares to earnings of $5.76 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.28%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies would post earnings of $4.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.51, delivering a surprise of 11.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Thermo Fisher , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, posted revenues of $10.68 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.30%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $9.33 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Thermo Fisher shares have lost about 22.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for Thermo Fisher?While Thermo Fisher has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Thermo Fisher: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

20,1629903a-d501-3438-8de4-b6ffd1e9c6ee,USB,2022-10-27,"With 68% ownership of the shares, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/68-ownership-shares-u-bancorp-120045491.html,1666872045,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Every investor in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 68% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that U.S. Bancorp does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of U.S. Bancorp, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. U.S. Bancorp is not owned by hedge funds. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. With 7.7% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that U.S. Bancorp insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$86m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over U.S. Bancorp. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 8.1% of the U.S. Bancorp shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

21,193dfd1d-d1bd-3a90-9247-d43fcdac89f9,CF,2022-10-27,CF Industries (CF) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-cf-reports-next-140202138.html,1666792922,STORY,['CF'],"[The market expects CF Industries (CF) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +242.7%.Revenues are expected to be $2.35 billion, up 72.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CF?For CF, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CF will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CF would post earnings of $6.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.19, delivering a surprise of +2.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CF doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This multi-million-dollar investment to the 1.2 million square foot facility is part of a broader initiative that the retailer announced last year to renovate all 42 regional distribution centers with automated technology. This technology will continue modernizing Walmart’s vast supply chain network aiming to increase the speed, efficiency and safety at which products are distributed.This press release features multimedia.

Regional distribution centers are a strategic part of Walmart’s broader supply chain network and exist to keep its more than 4,700 stores stocked with food items, home goods and tech gadgets.

(NYSE: RJF) today reported net revenues of $2.83 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $437 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2022. Excluding $30 million of expenses related to acquisitions, quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $459 million(2), or $2.08 per diluted share(2).Quarterly net revenues grew 5% over the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and 4% over the preceding quarter, largely driven by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates on net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks, which more than offset declines in asset management and related administrative fees and total brokerage revenues largely attributable to the decline in equity markets.Story continuesQuarterly net income available to common shareholders increased 2% compared to the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter reflecting the aforementioned revenue growth which was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses and a higher effective tax rate. The fiscal fourth quarter included a full quarter of results for TriState Capital(3) and SumRidge Partners(4) which added approximately $25 million of incremental non-compensation expenses sequentially, excluding bank loan provision for credit losses. The effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 28.7%, primarily attributable to nondeductible losses on the corporate owned life insurance portfolio.Compared to the prior fiscal year, record net revenues of $11.0 billion increased 13%, record pre-tax income increased 13%, record earnings per diluted share of $6.98 increased 5%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.49(2) increased 3%. Return on common equity for the fiscal year was 17.0% and adjusted return on tangible common equity was 21.1%(2).“Notwithstanding the challenging and volatile market environment during the fiscal year, we generated record results with annual net revenues and pre-tax income growth of 13%, which was driven by strong organic growth, particularly in the Private Client Group segment, the benefit of higher short-term interest rates and, most importantly, our advisors’ and associates’ unwavering focus on always putting their clients first,” said Chair and CEO Paul Reilly. “We also made significant progress deploying capital over the past year, successfully completing our strategic acquisitions of Charles Stanley, TriState Capital and SumRidge Partners. We are well positioned entering fiscal 2023 with strong capital ratios and a flexible balance sheet, which should support our results in any market environment.” Segment Results Private Client GroupRecord quarterly net revenues of $1.99 billion, up 11% over the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and 2% over the preceding quarterRecord quarterly pre-tax income of $371 million, up 67% over the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and 48% over the preceding quarterRecord annual net revenues of $7.71 billion and record annual pre-tax income of $1.03 billion, up 17% and 38%, respectively, over fiscal 2021Private Client Group assets under administration of $1.04 trillion, down 7% compared to September 2021 and 3% compared to June 2022Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts of $586.0 billion, down 7% compared to September 2021 and 3% compared to June 2022Private Client Group financial advisors of 8,681(5) increased 199 over September 2021 and 65 over June 2022 Clients’ domestic cash sweep balances of $67.1 billion, up 1% over September 2021 and down 12% compared to June 2022Growth in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was driven primarily by the increases in RJBDP fees and net interest income which more than offset the market-driven declines in asset management and related administrative fees and brokerage revenues.Total clients’ domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $67.1 billion, up 1% over September 2021 and down 12% compared to June 2022. The sequential decline reflects expected cash sorting activity given the higher short-term interest rate environment, which has continued in October. These balances do not include any high-yield savings deposits or money market fund balances.“Our client-first values and leading technology and product offerings resulted in strong retention and recruitment of financial advisors in fiscal 2022, which led to robust domestic Private Client Group net new assets of approximately $95 billion, or 9% of beginning of period assets,” said Reilly. “Entering fiscal 2023, financial advisor recruiting activity remains strong across our employee, independent contractor and independent RIA affiliation options.” Capital MarketsQuarterly net revenues of $399 million, down 28% compared to the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and up 4% over the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $66 million, down 64% compared to the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and up 8% over the preceding quarterQuarterly investment banking revenues of $207 million, down 41% compared to the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and 5% compared to the preceding quarter Annual net revenues of $1.81 billion and annual pre-tax income of $415 million, down 4% and 22%, respectively, compared to a record fiscal 2021Quarterly net revenues declined 28% compared to the prior-year quarter largely driven by lower investment banking revenues and fixed income brokerage revenues. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues grew 4% as increases in the affordable housing investments business and M&amp;A revenues offset declines in brokerage and underwriting revenues.“Following last year’s record results, the Capital Markets segment generated its second highest revenues and pre-tax income in fiscal 2022 bolstered by record M&amp;A revenues,” said Reilly. “Looking ahead, heightened volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties will continue to impact capital markets activity. However, investments we have made in expanding our M&amp;A platform and adding high-quality expertise and capabilities, including the recent acquisition of technology-driven fixed income market maker SumRidge Partners, should position us well over the long term.” Asset ManagementQuarterly net revenues of $216 million, down 9% compared to the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and 5% compared to the preceding quarter Quarterly pre-tax income of $83 million, down 27% compared to the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and 11% compared to the preceding quarterRecord annual net revenues of $914 million and annual pre-tax income of $386 million, up 5% and down 1%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2021Financial assets under management of $173.8 billion, down 9% compared to September 2021 and 5% compared to June 2022The decline of quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was largely attributable to lower financial assets under management, as net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group were offset by fixed income and equity market declines. BankRecord quarterly net revenues of $428 million, up 143% over the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and 55% over the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $123 million, up 52% over the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and 66% over the preceding quarterBank segment net interest margin (“NIM”) of 2.91% for the quarter, up 99 basis points over the prior year’s fiscal fourth quarter and 50 basis points over the preceding quarterRecord annual net revenues of $1.08 billion and annual pre-tax income of $382 million, up 61% and 4%, respectively, over fiscal 2021Record net loans of $43.2 billion, up 73% over September 2021 and 3% over June 2022Quarterly net revenue and pre-tax income growth was primarily due to the inclusion of TriState Capital Bank for a full quarter, as well as NIM expansion. The Bank segment’s NIM increased 50 basis points during the quarter to 2.91%, reflecting higher short-term interest rates and the relatively high concentration of floating-rate assets. Net loans grew 3% over the preceding quarter primarily driven by higher residential mortgages and corporate loans. TriState Capital Bank also generated sequential growth of securities-based loans. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remained strong, with criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ending the quarter at 1.14%, down from 3.27% at September 2021 and 1.63% at June 2022. Bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans held for investment was 0.91%, and bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was 1.73%. OtherThe firm repurchased 600,000 shares of common stock for approximately $62 million at an average price of approximately $104 per share in the fiscal fourth quarter. Including additional share repurchases totaling $38 million in October, approximately $800 million remained available under the Board’s approved share repurchase authorization as of October 26, 2022. At the end of the quarter, the total capital ratio was 20.5%(6) and the tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.3%(6), both well above the regulatory requirements.A conference call to discuss the results will take place tomorrow morning, Thursday, October 27, at 8:15 a.m. ET.

28,24c0f6f3-176a-3e1d-bfef-6d5c8ea9c775,UAA,2022-10-27,Slowing Rates Of Return At Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) Leave Little Room For Excitement,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slowing-rates-return-under-armour-174451320.html,1666806291,STORY,['UAA'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Under Armour:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$525m ÷ (US$5.0b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).Thus, Under Armour has an ROCE of 15%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Under Armour roceIn the above chart we have measured Under Armour's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Under Armour's ROCE Trend?Over the past five years, Under Armour's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Under Armour doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.Another point to note, we noticed the company has increased current liabilities over the last five years. This is intriguing because if current liabilities hadn't increased to 29% of total assets, this reported ROCE would probably be less than15% because total capital employed would be higher.The 15% ROCE could be even lower if current liabilities weren't 29% of total assets, because the the formula would show a larger base of total capital employed. So while current liabilities isn't high right now, keep an eye out in case it increases further, because this can introduce some elements of risk.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, Under Armour isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Since the stock has declined 41% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.If you're still interested in Under Armour it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

That is, insiders acquired the stock in greater numbers than they sold it.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Marc Oken for US$837k worth of shares, at about US$167 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$153. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Marc Oken.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$185m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging.

Parrell, Equity Residential’s president and CEO, “The substantial embedded growth in our rent roll and our financially resilient and highly employable resident base leaves us well positioned to deliver above average results in 2023 despite likely macroeconomic turbulence.”Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues were up 11.8% year over year, reflecting healthy demand during the primary leasing season.

This makes the dividend yield 4.2%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares' Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable.Huntington Bancshares has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but Huntington Bancshares' payout ratio of 47% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 21.3%. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 43% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendHuntington Bancshares Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.16, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.62. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 15% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Huntington Bancshares Could Grow Its DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Huntington Bancshares has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 9.1% per annum. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.We Really Like Huntington Bancshares' DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Huntington Bancshares might even raise payments in the future. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis casino and resort operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +633.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.21 billion, up 18.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 22.42% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MGM?For MGM, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -100%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MGM will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MGM would post earnings of $0.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.03, delivering a surprise of -87.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MGM doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Their departure illustrates how U.S. sanctions on the energy sector have made operating in the country with the most crude reserves untenable, leading to idle oilfields.Eight foreign companies among PDVSA's 44 joint ventures have transferred or given up stakes since 2018. Another seven smaller firms no longer have a presence in Venezuela and 15 projects are inactive, even though those partners technically remain, an internal PDVSA document seen by Reuters showed.""None of those stakes are recoverable at book value,"" said an oil executive whose firm left Venezuela by selling to a another company last year. ""Among those remaining in the partnerships, few hope to ever recoup pending dividends or commercial debts from PDVSA.""More than three years of harsh U.S. sanctions on PDVSA have restricted access to capital and cashflow and have limited the markets receiving Venezuelan oil, taking a toll on the mostly foreign minority stakeholders, their operations and workers.Since TotalEnergies and Equinor in 2021 exited one of Venezuela's flagship oil upgrading projects, Petrocedeno, smaller firms have followed.The French company reported a loss of $1.38 billion from transferring its 30% stake to a PDVSA unit. It received ""a symbolic amount"" for its assets, Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné said at the time.The transfer freed Total of past and future liabilities from its Venezuela projects. But dividends and debts owed by Petrocedeno to the partners also were wiped out, two people familiar with the matter said.Story continuesInpex last year sold stakes in two Venezuelan assets to private equity firm Sucre Energy Group, and returned a stake in a third project to PDVSA. Accounts receivable and owed dividends were transferred to Sucre as part of the transaction, but at a heavily discounted value, a person involved in the transaction said.The departures highlight the risks of doing business with cash-strapped PDVSA and the few legal avenues available to companies that have not been paid.Equinor declined to disclose details of the transaction, but confirmed in an email the company has no remaining activity in the country. Inpex, Total and PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment.WHAT ABOUT THE WORKERS?Some companies losing staff in Venezuela or dealing with labor claims, including Venezuelan oil firm Suelopetrol and GPB Global Resources, have discovered PDVSA appointed new joint venture managers or took over their operations.GPB Global Resources, a stakeholder in the Petrozamora joint venture, in September lost operational control on the ground of its projects, even though it had not been informed on a takeover nor received any compensation from PDVSA, the company said.""There is a very substantial debt owed by the Petrozamora joint venture to a subsidiary of GPB Global Resources,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it intends to pursue ""all available avenues of recourse"" against PDVSA, Venezuela or any third party that may acquire the shares or assets.A worker from Petrozamora who asked not to be identified said staff has not been paid completely. ""Days ago, an official passed by and said the company had not respected its contract with PDVSA.""Suelopetrol declined to comment on talks with PDVSA, but said the company remains committed to Venezuela, with assets and staff in place.With companies and workers leaving almost en masse, the abandonment of oilfields is visible near Maracaibo Lake, among Venezuela's oldest producing region. Its oil output keeps falling, outages became routine and some workers are on the verge of starvation.""A month ago, they tried to restart a small rig and it caused an explosion that sent crude to people's houses,"" said a neighbor of Maracaibo's Cabimas oilfield, his feet stained with oil.From over 110,000 workers a decade ago, PDVSA's workforce has dropped to about 60,000 people, said Daniel Delgado, a union leader at the Tia Juana oilfield.""We are risking our lives to get an oil barrel out by working in unsafe conditions, without proper equipment or medical assistance. It's a high price,"" Delgado said.Between 2019 and 2021, PDVSA delivered oil cargoes to partners to reduce outstanding debt.Eni and Repsol this summer received 3.6 million barrels in a temporary resumption of oil-for-debt, but nothing since then. Chevron has proposed to the U.S. government it be allowed to recoup its debts through an expanded license, yet pending.""Almost none of the companies that have left the country have been given that benefit,"" said an oil industry representative, who declined to be identified.The departures have hit oil service providers and contractors the hardest, said the Venezuelan Petroleum Chamber, whose members fell to 300 from 500 in the last four years.Venezuela last year fell short of reaching its oil production goal. And so far this year output has stalled at about 725,000 barrels per day (bpd), well below its year-end target of 2 million bpd.To further increase production would require PDVSA to honor past debts, said Enrique Novoa, the Chamber's president, adding: ""Sanctions also must be eased, at least partially.""(Reporting by Marianna Parraga, Mariela Nava and Deisy Buitrago.

Global investors dumped Chinese assets early this week as the economy of the world's biggest energy consumer was beset by a zero-COVID policy, a property crisis and falling market confidence.""Concerns that China's muddled economic policies may continue under President Xi Jinping's growing power weighed on sentiment,"" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, general manager of research at Nissan Securities.In early trade, the U.S. dollar touched a one-month low, lending oil support, although the U.S. currency rallied later. A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies and usually reflects greater investor appetite for risk.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Continues Its High-Flying WaysBy James RubinBitcoin (BTC) continued its recent, mini surge, topping $21,000 at one point after Canada’s central bank raised its main interest rate less robustly than expected, and despite disappointing earnings late Tuesday by Google parent Alphabet and software giant Microsoft.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,800, up more than 3.5% over the past 24 hours amid the Bank of Canada’s approval of a 50 basis point (BPS) hike instead of 75 BPS. The bank noted its concerns about the slowing of the economy. Central bankers globally have been trying to tame inflation without sparking a steep recession. On Tuesday BTC topped $20,000 for the first time since Oct. 5.""Economic growth is expected to stall through the end of this year and the first half of next year as the effects of higher interest rates spread through the economy,"" the Bank of Canada said in a statement that noted its progress in cutting inflation to below 7% and underlined its concerns about declining economic growth.Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands at $1,575, a nearly 8% gain from Tuesday, same time, tacking onto its more than 11% increase of the following day. The second-largest crypto in market value has reached its highest level since mid-September.Most major altcoins were well in the green, with popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB recently up more than 14% and 5%, respectively. The former’s rise comes amid the approaching close of billionaire entrepreneur and DOGE enthusiast Elon Musk’s acquisition of social media platform Twitter.Story continuesThe CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, climbed 3.09% over the past 24 hours.In traditional markets, U.S. stocks slumped after rising the previous two days as investors mulled over the tech industry’s struggles, which are likely to continue. Embattled social media platform.Meta Platforms (FB) reported third-quarter revenue of just $285 million for its Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations, according to its earnings report released Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was roughly flat. Both Microsoft and Alphabet earnings results killed what was becoming a ""not too bad outlook for the economy,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda.In commodities, Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, rose to $94 per barrel, up about 0.27% from the previous day. Three weeks after OPEC announced it was cutting production, investors remain fretful about energy prices. Brent crude is up more than 15% since the start of the year. Safe-haven gold was up 0.7% at $1,664 per ounce.Housing starts plunged nearly 11% in September, continuing a recent trend that some observers of U.S. monetary policy hope will enable the Federal Reserve to ratchet back its recent monetary hawkishness.

Crypto Twitter and niche altcoin Telegram groups are awash with discussions about countless tokens named after participating countries, players, stadiums and even the hosting country itself. The tokens are allowing speculators to weirdly bet on the prices of their favorites.No licensingNone of these tokens are licensed, or even affiliated, with any World Cup participants. That hasn’t stopped bettors from making big gains. A token called world cup inu surged some 500% in the past week alone, with others like CHAMPS and world cup token gaining at least 200% (before seeing price falls in the past 24 hours).Not everything is a random scramble, however. As CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported on Tuesday, some fan tokens issued on blockchain-based fan rewards platforms Socios and Bitci allow holders to contribute to merchandising, participate in exclusive meet-and-greet events and earn loyalty rewards.In the past seven days, fan tokens of the Peruvian national football team (FPFT), Spain's national team (SNFT) and Brazil's national team (BFT) have rallied 29%, 17% and 12%, respectively, according to data source CoinGecko. Fan tokens of Turkish and Argentinian teams have risen by 10% and 9%, as reported.Availability of capitalWhat’s driving the latest frenzy? The likes of Wes Hansen, director of trading and operations at crypto fund Arca, blames sidelined capital that’s looking to invest in, well, just about anything with a short-term narrative.“There is a lot of cash on the sidelines waiting for any opportunity to invest, which is why short-term event trades have been the only way to generate decent returns for a few months now,” Hansen told CoinDesk in a recent chat.He added: “When those conditions are coupled with a massive month-long event like the World Cup and the love this industry has for meme tokens, there are bound to be some savvy entrepreneurs that launch World Cup-themed tokens (ex. WCI and WILLIE).”But hopeful investors should still exercise some caution, he noted. “These tokens just become high-velocity trading vehicles that have little to no intrinsic value or functionality and will disappear as soon as the event begins to wear on,” Hansen said, adding that that one of the interesting reasons behind the rise of such tokens was that that they give fans a way to “interact with and support their favorite teams.”Important events4:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:15 UTC) European Central Bank Monetary Policy Decision Statement4:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:30 UTC) United States Durable Goods Orders (Sept)4:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:30 UTC) United States Gross Domestic Product Annualized (Q3) 6:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(10:15 UTC) European Central Bank's President Lagarde Speech7:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(23:00 UTC) Bank of Japan Monetary Policy StatementCoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Crypto Markets Surge, Liquidations, Tech Earnings and Reddit NFTs""The Hash"" team hashed out hot topics, including the crypto market surge, with bitcoin challenging $21,000.

Traders are positioning for a potential fuel crunch in the U.S., given that inventories are currently at an eight-year low.On Thursday, London-traded Brent Oil Futures rose 0.3% to $94.08 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.3% to $88.15 a barrel, as of 22:12 ET (02:12 GMT). Both contracts jumped between 2% and 4% on Wednesday, and were trading at two-week highs.Further benefiting prices, the dollar sank to an over one-month low on Thursday, as traders bet that an economic slowdown will force the Federal Reserve to slow its pace of interest rate hikes.Strength in the dollar, which surged to 20-year highs this year on rising interest rates, has weighed heavily on crude markets by making dollar-denominated oil imports more expensive.Oil prices rose sharply from annual lows this month after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Allies (OPEC+) announced its largest supply cut since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.This, coupled with sanctions on Russian oil, is expected to tighten supply towards the end of the year.But the U.S. threatened to offset this tightening by releasing more oil from the SPR. The White House released about 3.4 million barrels of crude from the SPR last week, bringing the stockpile to its lowest level since 1984.Story continuesOil demand in the world’s largest importer, China, is also expected to remain weak in the coming months, given that the country has no plans to scale back its strict zero-COVID policy.Related ArticlesOil Prices Hit 2-Week High on Strong Demand Signals, Weak DollarOil prices continue climb on strong crude demand, weaker dollarGold Hits 2-Week High, Copper Firms as Dollar Retreats]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now.Wharton's Jeremy Siegel: ""I Think There's Going To Be A Pivot Soon""On October 25, in an interview on CNBC, Jeremy Siegel, Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, offered his take on the current market situation and what he sees happening ahead as we move into 2023. Jeremy Siegel expects the Fed to turn dovish, after raising rates by 75 basis points again,  at the FOMC meeting in November. Though the Fed is expected to raise rates, according to Mr. Siegel, the institution will hint at a pivot and ""acknowledge that there has been a tremendous amount of progress made on inflation"". Here are some comments from Jeremy Siegel:""I think the market is more than hoping for what exactly it is- a statement by the Fed that they see progress, and at some point can afford to pause and see if that progress really makes it. That's what the market is looking for. What scares the market the most is that the Fed is gonna stay this tight through 2023, which I absolutely think would be really disastrous.""According to Mr. Siegel, ""tremendous progress has already been made against inflation and we're way on the downside"".  Mr. Siegel said that he ""wouldn't be surprised to see a 2% Federal funds rate by the end of 2023"". While there is still a risk of the Fed continuing its aggressive rate hike schedule and significantly slowing down the economy, Wharton's Jeremy Siegel thinks that ""there's a chance that the Fed can save stagflation, and a serious recession, if they acknowledge now that progress has been made"" as ""inflation is coming down"".While the current stock market situation is uncertain and volatile, equity investors can take advantage of the recent share price weakness and rack up shares of some of the best-in-class companies, while they trade at bargain levels.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.Some of the best stocks to buy for long-term gains include Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

We have trimmed and concentrated our software exposure significantly over the last 18 months down to two cloud-native SAAS players, Workday and Salesforce. We met with both businesses during our trip and came away encouraged from language indicating increased focus on profitability and cost control.We see significant optionality in these businesses to grow at the same time as expanding margins and free cash flow. The discussions increased our conviction that returns on capital are now becoming a priority for CEOs and CFOs in this sector who are talking for the first time about cost discipline, reduced capex, more measured hiring practices, a reduction in the level of stock-based compensation and scaled back M&amp;A ambitions.

(NYSE:UBER) is a market leader in the ridesharing industry with a strong competitive advantage. The company has a large and growing customer base, a strong platform, and a growing suite of services. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is one of the best stocks to buy right now. The company is well-funded and has abundant cash flows.

(NYSE:UBER) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We believe the market is underestimating the competitive position and earnings potential that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has in its core Rides and Eats businesses. Uber holds the #1 position in 90% of its rideshare markets globally and is typically more than twice the size of its next competitor. Having the largest and most dense driver network is a key advantage as it enables Uber to offer shorter pickup times and lower prices than competitors while also earning higher margins. We believe the synergies between Rides and Eats will further improve Uber’s service quality and cost position. In recent years, competition from well-funded but unprofitable challengers has pressured Uber’s economics. However, as these challengers are forced to compete more rationally, we expect Uber to generate significant margin improvement alongside continued high growth. We began buying shares at just over 1x revenue and a double-digit free cash flow yield based on management’s guidance for 2024. We view this as an attractive valuation for a business with Uber’s future growth outlook.”6.

This is compared to 136 positions in the preceding quarter with stakes worth $15.44 billion.As of June 30, Akre Capital Management is the most prominent investor in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and has stakes worth $1.84 billion in the company.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The Fund’s holdings in the Payments and Information Services themes also contributed to relative performance. Within Payments, lower exposure to this lagging theme and outperformance of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) added the most value. These global payment networks are viewed as safe havens during market downturns but are also benefiting from resilient payment volumes and a sharp rebound in international travel.”Equities are being hit hard and are presenting an attractive entry point for investors to cash in on the weakness.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) share price is up 61% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 43% (ignoring dividends).Since it's been a strong week for Salesforce shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Salesforce While Salesforce made a small profit, in the last year, we think that the market is probably more focussed on the top line growth at the moment. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.In the last 5 years Salesforce saw its revenue grow at 22% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. It's good to see that the stock has 10%, but not entirely surprising given revenue shows strong growth. If you think there could be more growth to come, now might be the time to take a close look at Salesforce. Of course, you'll have to research the business more fully to figure out if this is an attractive opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthSalesforce is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling Salesforce stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Salesforce shareholders are down 44% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 10% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Salesforce that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at nearly $966 million, indicating an increase of about 20% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days at $1.67 per share, indicating a 9.9% increase from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. This designer, marketer and distributor of outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle apparel, footwear and accessories has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 61.3%, on average. In the last reported quarter, COLM’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 175%.Things to ConsiderColumbia Sportswear is committed to enhancing its global direct-to-consumer (DTC) business through accelerated investments. COLM’s DTC e-commerce business has been robust for a while now. In addition, it is benefiting from a solid performance across its brands. Management remains committed to undertaking brand-enhancing and unique marketing initiatives to strengthen COLM’s position. Continuation of these factors is most likely to boost results during the quarter under review.On its second-quarter earnings call, management had projected net sales growth of around 20% for the third quarter, mainly backed by the sale of its fall 2022 order book and a modest direct-to-consumer (DTC) advancement. It anticipated net sales growth of 9-12% for the second half of 2022. Management had envisioned earnings per share in the range of $3.85-$4.25 for the second half. An EPS of $3.91 was reported in the same period last year.Increased promotional activity to rationalize the inventory and supply-chain hurdles remains a concern. Columbia Sportswear has been seeing higher SG&amp;A costs for a while now.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Columbia Sportswear this time around.

This compares with losses attributable to common shareholders of $(1,091) million, or $(0.55) per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2021.GAAP results were primarily driven by unrecoverable interest expense and other earnings factors, including allowance for funds used during construction equity, incentive revenues, tax benefits, and cost savings, net of below-the-line costs. Results are also driven by costs related to the amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset and accretion of the related Wildfire Fund liability, strategic repositioning costs, Fire Victim Trust tax benefit net of securitization, PG&amp;E Corporation’s and Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s (Utility) reorganization cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Chapter 11), wildfire-related costs, and investigation remedies, partially offset by prior period net regulatory impact.Story continues""PG&amp;E is committed to reducing risk and delivering reliable, affordable service to our customers and hometowns, while making the right investments for a clean energy future,"" said Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&amp;E Corporation.

Factors driving GAAP earnings include costs related to unrecoverable interest expense of $330 million to $370 million after tax and other earnings factors, including allowance for funds used during construction equity, incentive revenues, tax benefits, and cost savings, net of below-the-line costs. Additional factors include the amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset and accretion of the related Wildfire Fund liability, PG&amp;E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reorganization cases under Chapter 11, wildfire-related costs, investigation remedies, and strategic repositioning costs, partially offset by Fire Victim Trust tax benefit net of securitization and prior period net regulatory impact.On a non-GAAP basis, the guidance range for projected 2022 non-GAAP core earnings is narrowed to $1.09 to $1.11 per diluted share. The guidance range for non-core items, which management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, is updated to $220 million to $630 million after tax.Guidance is based on various assumptions and forecasts, including those relating to authorized revenues, future expenses, capital expenditures, rate base, equity issuances, and certain other factors.2023 GuidancePG&amp;E Corporation is initiating 2023 GAAP earnings guidance in the range of $0.98 to $1.21 per diluted share.

The 2022 low case includes tax benefits for the 135,000,000 shares of PG&amp;E Corporation common stock sold in the aggregate by the Fire Victim Trust as of October 20, 2022, plus losses, net of gains, on investments related to the Customer Credit Trust, and the 2022 high case reflects an assumption that the Fire Victim Trust sells all 477,743,590 shares in 2022, plus losses, net of gains, on investments related to the Customer Credit Trust. The 2023 low case reflects an assumption that the Fire Victim Trust sells zero shares during 2023, whereas the 2023 high case reflects an assumption that the Fire Victim Trust sells the remaining 342,743,590 shares during 2023.

""Non-core items"" include items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings and affect comparability of financial results between periods, consisting of the items listed in Exhibit A. ""Non-GAAP core EPS,"" also referred to as ""non-GAAP core earnings per share,"" is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as non-GAAP core earnings divided by common shares outstanding (taken on a basic basis in the event of a GAAP loss and a diluted basis in the event of a GAAP gain). PG&amp;E Corporation and the Utility use non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposes including internal budgeting and forecasting, short- and long-term operating planning, and employee incentive compensation. PG&amp;E Corporation and the Utility believe that non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business, allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance. With respect to our projection of non-GAAP core EPS for the years 2024-2026, we are not providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the reconciling items that may affect GAAP net income without unreasonable effort. The reconciling items are primarily due to the future impact of wildfire-related costs, timing of regulatory recoveries, special tax items, and investigation remedies. These reconciling items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, the GAAP measures.Non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS are not substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures such as consolidated income available for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221026006130/en/ContactsInvestor Relations Contact: 415.972.7080Media Inquiries Contact: 415.973.5930 | www.pgecorp.com]"

The V2G export rate promotes EV adoption by providing upfront incentives to help commercial customers offset fleet costs and delivers an innovative solution for these vehicles to export power back to support the grid during peak energy demand periods.The groundbreaking settlement agreement with the Vehicle-Grid Integration Council (VGIC), Electrify America LLC and the Public Advocates Office at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) was adopted by the CPUC on Oct. 20, 2022. The rate is expected to increase participation from V2G school buses and other electric vehicles in response to near-real-time grid conditions and will be available to charging equipment paired with stationary energy storage systems, which can support the grid and provide backup power to charge vehicles during grid outages.More than 420,000 EVs have been sold in PG&amp;E’s service area, representing one in six EVs in the country. As large vehicles like school buses and commercial fleets continue to electrify, the opportunity grows for these vehicles to serve as crucial, flexible grid resources to support a more reliable, affordable and efficient energy system. Greater volumes of these vehicles on the road comes at a critical time, as peak energy demand challenges California’s grid and novel solutions like V2G emerge.""The adoption of the nation’s first V2G export rate aligns with our core focus of proactively preparing the grid, increasing access to EV infrastructure, and supporting EV adoption through rates, rebates, tools, and education,"" said Aaron August, PG&amp;E Vice President, Utility Partnerships and Innovation.Story continuesThis new export rate structure, in the nation’s largest EV market, can serve as a guide for additional innovative rate structures across the country. As utility regulators, state agencies and industry partners continue to move forward with policy and market design in this dynamic space, VGIC is committed to advancing the role of smart EV charging and discharging through policy development, education, outreach, and research to support transportation and electric sector decarbonization.""The CPUC’s decision is a strong step forward for Californians and in support of the state’s grid, implementing the nation’s first dynamic export rate for EV charging customers,"" Ed Burgess, VGIC Policy Director, said. ""As ever-greater numbers of EVs hit the roads, this innovative rate option will allow EV owners to further benefit from their investment in clean transportation. Leveraging the capability of EVs as a grid resource will help integrate more clean energy into our power system, reduce energy bills for all utility customers, and support California’s ambitious decarbonization goals. We appreciate PG&amp;E’s constructive approach to supporting this program, and believe it serves as a guidepost for other forward-looking energy providers to follow across the country.""PG&amp;E is committed to providing easy-to-use and affordable clean transportation programs and incentives that help redefine the energy landscape to support California’s clean air and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and collective action on climate change.As part of PG&amp;E’s 2030 targets, the company is aiming to proactively prepare the grid for 12,000 GWh of EV-related electric load and improve processes to enable rapid, safe EV energization and interconnection. It’s also working to enable 2 million EVs to participate in vehicle-grid integration applications, allowing EVs to be a cornerstone of both reliability and resilience.

An improvement in economic conditions after the pandemic has been generating fresh demand for utility services.Domestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities.Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate the utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulation of emissions, the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also urging the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from the near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Per the updated outlook of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have created higher demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.Per the latest Earnings Trends report, the utility sector’s third-quarter earnings are expected to decline 9.3%, while revenues are estimated to improve 1.8%.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

This compares to earnings of $2.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -38.46%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of the Invisalign tooth-straightening system would post earnings of $2.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2, delivering a surprise of -5.66%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Align Technology , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry, posted revenues of $890.35 million for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.11%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.02 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Align Technology shares have lost about 66.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for Align Technology?While Align Technology has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Align Technology: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.43 on $1.04 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.74 on $3.95 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Dental Supplies is currently in the bottom 20% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Meta, Ford ServiceNow, and Align Technologies.Let's kick it off with Meta. You can see the stock off nearly 12% here after hours. A company reporting an earnings miss, also softer revenue guidance. Its earnings, or its revenue from its Reality Labs also missing expectations, because people simply aren't buying headsets. We just heard that from analyst Brent Thill.Taking a look at the performance here, over the last three months, you can see the stock off just around 18%. Over the past year, off 58%. Here we are today, right around 52, a week lows.Mark Zuckerberg also making some headlines about headcount plans. When it comes to Meta, he's saying that he sees the head count at the end of next year, at the end of 2023, around the same level as what we just saw at the end of the third quarter of 2022. So certainly, reining in any hiring plans that the company had had. And you could see Meta off just around 12% after hours.Let's take a look at Ford here. Shares off just around 1.6%. When you take a look at the quota numbers, it wasn't that bad.Revenue beat at 39.4 billion, but adjusted EPS coming in a bit light. Ford also saying that it recorded a $2.7 billion charge on its Argos stake over the last three months. You can see the stock actually barely in the green, up just around 2%. Year-to-date, totally different story. You can see shares off around 38%.Let's take a look at ServiceNow. That stock jumping after hours, up nearly 12%. EPS coming in better than expected, at 196. A share adjusted revenue at 1.93 billion.CEO Bill McDermott, he has been named to the chairman post. He's going to be succeeding founder Fred Luddy.

It looks like the street though, shrugging that off. You can see shares up just over 11 and 1/2%.And Align Technology rounding it out there. Shares sinking 18%.

Estimated was for 973 million.A couple of things from the CEO in this earnings release. He talked about the weaker macroeconomic environment, also weaker consumer confidence. That having a direct impact on his business.

68,1820d393-ed92-3ba3-816b-cb799e9cee28,MRO,2022-10-27,Marathon Oil (MRO) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-oil-mro-reports-next-140202307.html,1666792922,STORY,"['MRO', 'ETRN']","[Marathon Oil (MRO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +205.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.07 billion, up 42.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Oil?For Marathon Oil, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marathon Oil would post earnings of $1.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.32, delivering a surprise of +7.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marathon Oil doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsEquitrans Midstream (ETRN), another stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.13 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $364.03 million, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Equitrans Midstream has been revised 2.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 12.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Equitrans Midstream will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Microsoft's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Microsoft How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:40% = US$70b ÷ US$174b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.40 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Microsoft's Earnings Growth And 40% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Microsoft has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 13% which is quite remarkable. So, the substantial 27% net income growth seen by Microsoft over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Next, on comparing Microsoft's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 26% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is MSFT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Microsoft Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Microsoft has a three-year median payout ratio of 30% (where it is retaining 70% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. So it seems that Microsoft is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, Microsoft is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 22% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Microsoft's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.The major indices are rallying for the seventh time this year, potentially crawling out of a bear market that's lasted for nearly six months. The Dow (^DJI), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC), and even the Russell 2000 (^RUT) are each up 9% to 11% from the mid-October lows as bulls flash the first signs of greed since August.Mega cap earnings this week will determine whether the rally continues. The top 20 components of the S&amp;P 500 by market capitalization account for 4% of the index by count but nearly 40% of the index by weight. This outsized representation gives each mega cap a disproportionate effect on the market.So far, it's looking like the mega caps could hinder the rally. This week, poor showings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META) have weighed on the major indices. The Google parent closed down 9.1% on Wednesday, marking its worst day since the pandemic lows of 2020. Apple (AAPL) reports after the closing bell today.Eight of the top 20 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have lost more than $100 billion in market cap as of Wednesday — with Microsoft down $780 billion, Alphabet $650 billion, and Meta Platforms $555 billion. Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon have each lost more than $400 billion since the start of 2022.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Apple is expected to report quarterly revenue of $88.6 billion, with $15.7 billion coming from greater China. With all the hype around the iPhone 14, it's easy to forget that multinationals like Apple are also suffering because of the strength of the U.S. dollar (DX-Y.NYB).Meta initially dropped as much as 14% after the bell Wednesday after lowering its sales forecast for the current quarter — in part because of foreign exchange-related headwinds.Story continuesOverall, the tech, communication services, and consumer discretionary sectors are each down about 30%. At the same time, the energy and health care sectors are on the upswing.Exxon Mobil (XOM) added over $190 billion to its market cap, while Chevron (CVX) tacked on nearly $120 billion. Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (LLY) and insurer UnitedHealth (UNH) added about $80 billion and $40 billion, respectively, this year. For the broad rally to continue, they'll likely need some help from the mega cap tech stocks.What to Watch TodayEconomy8:30 a.m. ET: GDP Annualized, quarter-over-quarter, 3Q A (2.4% expected, -0.6% prior)8:30 a.m. ET: Durable goods orders, September Preliminary (0.6% expected, -0.2% during prior month)8:30 a.m. ET: Personal Consumption, quarter-over-quarter, 3Q A (1% expected, 2.0% prior)8:30 a.m. ET: Durables excluding transportation, September Preliminary (0.2% expected, 0.3% during prior month)8:30 a.m. ET: GDP Price Index, quarter-over-quarter, 3Q A (5.3% expected, 9.0% prior)8:30 a.m. ET: Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, Septmeber Preliminary (0.2% expected, 0.3% during prior month)8:30 a.m. ET: Core PCE, quarter-over-quarter, 3Q A (4.6% expected, 4.7% prior)8:30 a.m. ET: Initial Jobless Claims, week ended Oct. 22 (225,000 expected, 214,000 during prior week)8:30 a.m. ET: Continuing Claims, week ended Oct. 15 (1.385 million during prior week)11:00 a.m. ET: Kansas City Manufacturing Index, October (-2 expected, 1 during prior week)EarningsAmazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Altria (MO), Ares Management (ARES), AutoNation (AN), Caterpillar (CAT), Capital One (COF)Comcast (CMCSA), CubeSmart (CUBE), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Hertz Global (HTZ), Honeywell (HON), Intel (INTC), Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP), Mastercard (MA), McDonald's (MCD), Merck (MRK), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Oshkosh (OSK), Overstock.com (OSTK), Pinterest (PINS), Royal Caribbean (RCL), S&amp;P Global (SPGI), Shopify (SHOP), Southwest Air (LUV), T.

DJIA is down 13.13% year-to-date, but this decline is comparatively less severe than the 19.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of October 24. Some of the most prominent Dow stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The Dow has maintained its individuality by being the price-weighted index in the US stock market. Though the index tracks the performance of just 30 companies, investing in the Dow provides exposure to some of the best names in the market, providing value to beginner investors. Moreover, these industry-leading companies are also favored because of their dividends and yields. Over the years, the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA have shown a strong correlation, however, their performances have branched off in the past. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, the Dow has slightly outperformed the broader market in the last 30 years ending June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, while DJIA returned 11.16%.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:Nearly all companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are dividend players.

The company is expected to report EPS of $0.73, down 27% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.43 billion, up 3.42% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Starbucks. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Danaher Corp. DHR, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, Starbucks Corp. SBUX, The TJX Companies, Inc TJX and Stryker Corp. SYK.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Danaher, Comcast and StarbucksThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. In today's Research Daily, we provide the updated Q3 earnings season scorecard, in addition to featuring new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Danaher Corp., Comcast Corp. and Starbucks Corp.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding all of this morning's results, we now have Q3 results from 129 S&amp;P 500 members or 25.8% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -0.5% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues, with 73.6% beating EPS estimates and 64.3% beating revenue estimates.The Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace and the EPS beats percentage for this group of 129 index members is better than what we saw from this group in the preceding period. The revenue beats percentage for this group of 129 index members at 64.3% is modestly below the 66.7% for this group in 2022 Q2, but otherwise well within the historical range.This is a reassuring showing on the corporate earnings front that runs counter to pre-season fears of an impending earnings cliff that will result in companies overwhelmingly guiding lower. We have seen some of those. But for the most part, management teams have either guided higher, reaffirmed previous outlook or provided favorable qualitative commentary.Story continuesA case in point is this morning's UPS report whose reaffirmed guidance ran counter to what we had heard from FedEx a few weeks back. While 3M guided lower, Coke and GM provided favorable commentary.With respect to the coming periods, expectations are getting reset lower, as we have consistently been pointing out all along.S&amp;P 500 earnings for the last quarter of the year (2022 Q4) are currently expected to be up only +0.1% from the same period last year, which is down from +1.1% on October 19th and +2.5% on August 31st. Excluding contribution from the Energy sector, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index are currently expected to be down -4% from the year-earlier period, which is down from -3.6% on October 19th and -1.9% on August 31st.Full year 2023 expectations are similarly coming down.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Preview article &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here's What to Expect from Big Tech EarningsToday's Featured Research ReportsShares of Danaher have declined -17.7% over the past year against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry's decline of -25.4%. High raw material costs, and component shortages, due to supply chain issues, are weighing on the company's operations. Coronavirus-induced headwinds in China add to its woes. Adverse foreign currency movements are affecting Danaher's top line.However, strong segmental performances are driving Danaher's growth. Robust activity in bioprocessing and strength in instrument business are boosting the Life Sciences unit's performance. Robust growth in Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics is acting as a catalyst to the Diagnostics segment's growth. Inorganic activities are contributing to the company's top line growth. Danaher's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends are encouraging.(You can read the full research report on Danaher here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Comcast shares have declined -42.5% over the past year against the Zacks Cable Television industry's decline of -47.0%. The company is persistently suffering from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.Though Comcast is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base. Slowing broadband user base addition primarily due to reversal of pandemic trends and increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber are concerns.Nevertheless, Comcast's plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help the company in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors. Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Starbucks shares have underperformed against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-26.1% vs. -13.5%). The company's performance continues to be negatively impacted by dismal China results, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, increased costs and a tight labor market. The company believes that performance will be under massive pressure for the rest of the year.However, Starbucks has been benefiting from operating fundamentals such as a solid global footprint, successful innovations and digital offerings. North America comps continue to impress investors.For fiscal 2023 to 2025, Starbucks anticipates global and U.S. comparable store sales growth between 7% and 9% year over year.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Investor Relations Earnings Release (Unaudited)Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy’s operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing return on equity (ROE), ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that adjusts measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy’s management uses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining performance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.Ongoing ROEOngoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity’s average stockholder’s equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)GAAP diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.’s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method. Ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP earnings (net income) for certain items. Ongoing diluted EPS for Xcel Energy is calculated by dividing net income or loss, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss for such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of Xcel Energy’s core earnings and underlying performance. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. For the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no such adjustments to GAAP earnings and therefore GAAP earnings equal ongoing earnings for these periods.Note 1. Earnings Per Share SummaryXcel Energy’s third quarter diluted earnings were $1.18 per share in 2022, compared with $1.13 per share in 2021. The increase was driven by regulatory rate outcomes, partially offset by higher depreciation, interest charges and O&amp;M expenses. Costs for natural gas significantly increased in 2022 due to supply and demand conditions. However, fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased power and/or natural gas sold and transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in costs are offset by the related variation in revenues).Summarized diluted EPS for Xcel Energy:Three Months Ended Sept. 30Nine Months Ended Sept. 30Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share2022202120222021PSCo$0.45$0.40$1.02$0.96NSP-Minnesota0.490.460.940.91SPS0.250.250.520.48NSP-Wisconsin0.070.070.190.15Earnings from equity method investments — WYCO0.010.010.030.03Regulated utility (a)1.281.192.692.54Xcel Energy Inc. and Other(0.09)(0.06)(0.21)(0.16)Total (a)$1.18$1.13$2.48$2.38(a)Amounts may not add due to rounding.PSCo — Earnings increased $0.05 per share for the third quarter of 2022 and $0.06 year-to-date.

The year-to-date increase is primarily due to regulatory rate outcomes, partially offset by increased depreciation, O&amp;M expenses and a Winter Storm Uri cost disallowance (see Note 5).SPS — Earnings were flat for the third quarter of 2022 and increased $0.04 per share year-to-date. Higher year-to-date earnings largely reflect regulatory rate outcomes, strong sales growth and favorable weather, partially offset by higher depreciation, O&amp;M expenses and interest charges.NSP-Wisconsin — Earnings were flat for the third quarter of 2022 and increased $0.04 per share year-to-date. The year-to-date increase is due to regulatory rate outcomes and sales growth, partially offset by higher depreciation and O&amp;M expenses.Xcel Energy Inc. and Other — Primarily includes financing costs at the holding company and earnings from Energy Impact Partners (EIP) funds equity method investments.

Regulated Utility ResultsEstimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings — Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements. As a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy’s financial performance. However, decoupling mechanisms in Colorado and proposed sales true-up mechanisms in Minnesota predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather for the electric utility in those jurisdictions.Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized estimates.Weather — Estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with normal weather conditions:Three Months Ended Sept. 30Nine Months Ended Sept. 302022 vs.Normal2021 vs.Normal2022 vs.20212022 vs.Normal2021 vs.Normal2022 vs.2021Retail electric$0.074$0.067$0.007$0.123$0.122$0.001Decoupling and sales true-up(0.032)(0.035)0.003(0.055)(0.076)0.021Electric total$0.042$0.032$0.010$0.068$0.046$0.022Firm natural gas———0.0190.0040.015Total$0.042$0.032$0.010$0.087$0.050$0.037Sales — Sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales in 2022 compared to 2021:Three Months Ended Sept. 30PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyActualElectric residential(1.7)%(2.7)%7.8%(0.1) %(0.7)%Electric C&amp;I(2.3)0.27.23.71.6Total retail electric sales(2.0)(0.8)7.32.60.9Firm natural gas sales(1.6)—N/A2.3(0.9)Three Months Ended Sept. 30PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyWeather-NormalizedElectric residential(4.6)%0.5%3.3%(0.1)%(1.1)%Electric C&amp;I(3.2)0.46.43.51.2Total retail electric sales(3.7)0.45.92.50.5Firm natural gas sales(1.5)(2.2)N/A—(1.6)Nine Months Ended Sept. 30PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyActualElectric residential(2.9)%(1.4)%4.9%1.3%(0.9)%Electric C&amp;I(0.3)2.39.63.63.6Total retail electric sales(1.2)1.18.62.92.2Firm natural gas sales(3.4)19.9N/A20.24.9Nine Months Ended Sept. 30PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyWeather-NormalizedElectric residential(3.7)%0.6%0.7%0.6%(1.0)%Electric C&amp;I(0.5)2.79.03.83.5Total retail electric sales(1.6)2.07.42.82.2Firm natural gas sales(2.4)6.0N/A7.40.9Weather-normalized electric sales growth (decline) — year-to-datePSCo — Residential sales declined due to decreased use per customer, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in customers.

In addition, residential and C&amp;I customer growth was 1.2% and 0.5%, respectively.Electric Margin — Electric margin is presented as electric revenues less electric fuel and purchased power expenses. Expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium. However, these price fluctuations generally have minimal earnings impact due to fuel recovery mechanisms that recover fuel expenses. In addition, electric customers receive a credit for PTCs generated, which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.Electric revenues, fuel and purchased power and margin and explanation of the changes are listed as follows:Three Months Ended Sept. 30Nine Months Ended Sept. 30(Millions of Dollars)2022202120222021Electric revenues$3,699$3,176$9,255$8,643Electric fuel and purchased power(1,497)(1,210)(3,772)(3,643)Electric margin$2,202$1,966$5,483$5,000(Millions of Dollars)Three Months EndedSept. 30,2022 vs. 2021Nine MonthsEnded Sept. 30,2022 vs. 2021Regulatory rate outcomes (Minnesota, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin)$165$361Revenue recognition for the Texas rate case surcharge (a)—85Sales and demand (b)2484Non-fuel riders848Conservation and demand side management (offset in expenses)931Wholesale transmission (net)1925Estimated impact of weather (net of decoupling/sales true-up)716PTCs flowed back to customers (offset by lower ETR)(17)(120)Proprietary commodity trading, net of sharing (c)(1)(33)Other (net)22(14)Total increase$236$483(a)Recognition of revenue from the Texas rate case outcome is largely offset by recognition of previously deferred costs.(b)Sales excludes weather impact, net of decoupling in Colorado and proposed sales true-up mechanism in Minnesota.(c)Includes $27 million of net gains recognized in the first quarter of 2021, driven by market changes associated with Winter Storm Uri.Natural Gas Margin — Natural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported.

An improvement in economic conditions after the pandemic has been generating fresh demand for utility services.Domestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities.Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate the utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulation of emissions, the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also urging the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from the near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Per the updated outlook of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have created higher demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.Per the latest Earnings Trends report, the utility sector’s third-quarter earnings are expected to decline 9.3%, while revenues are estimated to improve 1.8%.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

And he never worked for a company that gave him stock options.How’d He Do It? According to an interview with him on Marketwatch conducted by Adam Seessel, CIO of Gravity Capital Management, he didn’t even start investing until he was in his 40s.Avedisian, according to Marketwatch, was a self-taught investor who read investing books, the Wall Street Journal and Investor Business Daily, and watched CNBC and Bloomberg on cable tv.He liked IPOs and would read the IPO prospectuses in his spare time.While he didn’t tell Marketwatch what his exact investments were, he did say they were well-known companies that everyone would recognize.Tracey has some ideas about what he might have bought.5 Big Caps that an Investor Could Have Bought Over the Last 40 Years1.       Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)The first thing Tracey thought when she saw the headline about a retired musician having a portfolio worth $170 million was that he could have been an early investor in Berkshire Hathaway.There have been many Berkshire Hathaway millionaires revealed over the years. These were people who were early investors and held the stock for decades. In 2004, the New York Times interviewed some of them including one man who bought shares at $175 in 1978 and still owned some in 2004. They were trading at $93,000 per share at that time.Story continuesWhat if he had held on until 2022?$10,000 invested in Berkshire Hathaway on Jan 3, 1978 and held through Oct 25, 2022, were up 166,896% and would be worth $16.69 million.But Mr Avedisian told Marketwatch that while he DID own shares of Berkshire over the years, it wasn’t the main catalyst behind the portfolio.2.       Microsoft MSFTMr. Avedisian did mention Microsoft and Bill Gates in the article. Could he have bought the Microsoft IPO in 1986?$10,000 invested in the Microsoft IPO in 1986 through Oct 25, 2022, would have been up 261,000% and worth $26.1 million. That doesn’t get you to $170 million. But what if an investor had put in $100,000? It would be worth $260 million.There are a lot of Microsoft millionaires out there.3.       Amazon AMZNOr maybe Mr. Avedisian bought the Amazon IPO in 1997. It’s been a bit rockier for Amazon over those years, however.$10,000 invested in Amazon at the IPO and held through Oct 25, 2022 is up 160,699% and would be worth $16.06 million. (On the podcast, Tracey has a much lower number which isn’t correct.) But just a year ago these numbers would have been much higher before the shares slid in 2022.But there are still many “Amazon millionaires” out there who have stayed the course. Was Mr. Avedisian one of them?4.       Monster Beverage MNSTMonster Beverage also had an IPO in the 1990s. Perhaps Mr. Avedisian bought that one? Monster Beverage would go on to be one of the top performing S&amp;P 500 stocks of the last 30 years.$10,000 invested in the Monster Beverage IPO on Aug 18, 1995 and held through Oct 25, 2022, would be up 319,874%. That would be $32 million.Few people talk about the wealth generator that was Monster Beverage over the last 27 years.5.       ExxonMobil XOMBut not all big cap companies have been stock market winners. Take the example of ExxonMobil. In the 1970s, when Mr. Avedisian started investing, the best performing sector was energy.But ExxonMobil has had big periods of underperformance which have hurt returns of long-term investors.$10,000 invested in ExxonMobil on Jan 3, 1978 and held through Oct 25, 2022, would be up 3,591% and would be worth $359,000.That doesn’t sound so bad, right? However, the S&amp;P 500 was up 4209% during the same time. An investor could have just bought the index.Finding the big winning stocks isn’t as easy as Mr. Avedisian makes it seem.What Else Should You Know About This Amazing Stock Investor? Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of Microsoft in her personal portfolio but she did not, alas, buy them at the 1986 IPO.]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It anticipates a further strengthening next year.As a result, it estimates a 13% to 17% jump in operating revenue in the fourth quarter versus the same period of 2019 even as capacity is projected to be down about 2%.""While there's noise regarding whether we are headed into a recession or not or whether we may even be in one now, we have not seen any noticeable impact on our booking and revenue trends,"" Chief Executive Officer Bob Jordan said on an earnings call.The company's shares were up 2.8% at $35.34 in afternoon trade.Southwest is the latest U.S. airline to play down demand concerns.The airline industry, which is facing higher fuel and wage bills, has been relying on strong consumer demand to mitigate inflationary pressure with higher fares. Investors are worried that a recession could hit travel spending, hurting the industry's profits.Carriers, however, say an unquenched thirst for travel, hybrid work arrangements and limited airline capacity due to aircraft and pilot shortages would keep their business humming.AIRCRAFT DELIVERIESSouthwest expects aircraft delivery delays to persist into 2024. It is contractually scheduled to receive deliveries of 114 737 MAX jets from Boeing this year, but a portion of them is expected to be delayed as the U.S. planemaker continues to face supply chain challenges and regulatory hurdles in the certification of the 737 Max 7.Southwest, Boeing's biggest 737 customer, said it expects no 737 Max 7 deliveries this year and has converted 17 orders for next year to the 737 Max 8.Story continuesBoeing faces a late December deadline for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to certify the MAX 7 under existing rules.Southwest said while Boeing is ""very confident"" of securing certification or an extension for MAX 7, its network and business plan for next year assumes no deliveries of the aircraft.The airline expects to fully restore its network to pre-pandemic levels by December 2023. But fleet utilization is expected to be limited by pilot staffing constraints for the majority of next year, fueling cost pressures.Southwest said it is ""on track"" to hire 1,200 pilots this year and 2,100 pilots next year.It said reinstating its dividend is a ""high"" priority for the company. It also plans to resume share repurchases ""at the right time.""Third-quarter adjusted net income was 50 cents per share versus analysts' expectations of 42 cents per share.

(NYSE: LUV) (the ""Company"") today reported its third quarter 2022 financial results:Net income of $277 million, or $0.44 per diluted shareNet income, excluding special items1, of $316 million, or $0.50 per diluted shareRecord third quarter operating revenues of $6.2 billionLiquidity2 of $14.7 billion, well in excess of debt outstanding of $8.7 billionBob Jordan, Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""We are pleased to report solid third quarter 2022 profits and record third quarter operating revenues. Following record summer leisure travel demand, revenue trends remained strong in September 2022, bolstered by improving business travel trends post-Labor Day. Leisure and business demand remains strong, and we currently expect revenue trends to improve sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter 2022, despite lower capacity. Our fuel hedging strategy continues to provide protection against persistently high jet fuel prices, and we are 61 percent hedged in fourth quarter 2022 and 50 percent hedged in full year 2023. We continue to execute well against our full year 2022 non-fuel cost guidance, despite cost headwinds due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels and significant inflationary cost pressures. We remain focused on maintaining our current momentum and expect to generate strong profits and margins in fourth quarter 2022, based on current trends and barring any significant unforeseen events.""Our thoughts remain with those impacted by Hurricane Ian. We quickly resumed full service to all affected airports with the exception of Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, which is currently expected to operate a reduced flight schedule through at least the end of this year.""I am grateful to our Employees for their continued focus on Teamwork, Customer Service, and operational execution. I am very pleased that we were able to reward our Aircraft Appearance Technicians—represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA)—through a new five-year agreement, which was ratified earlier this month and provides immediate and future compensation increases for nearly 170 Employees. Additionally, we recently reached a tentative agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), who represent our Customer Service Agents, Customer Representatives, and Source of Support Representatives. The tentative agreement requires membership ratification and, if ratified, provides immediate and future compensation increases for more than 8,000 Employees. It remains a high priority to reach agreements on all of our open Labor contracts and reward our superb Employees with wage increases as soon as possible.Story continues""We continue working with The Boeing Company (Boeing) to finalize our 2023 aircraft delivery plans; however, we currently expect aircraft delivery delays to persist into 2024. Today, we extended our flight schedule through July 10, 2023, and we currently expect first quarter 2023 capacity to increase approximately 10 percent and second quarter 2023 capacity to increase approximately 14 percent, both year-over-year. While we have not yet finalized capacity plans for second half 2023, and there is uncertainty around the timing of aircraft deliveries, we are building our 2023 capacity plan with a goal to have sufficient aircraft to operate our 2023 flight schedules, as originally published, in an effort to enhance operational reliability. We plan to allocate the vast majority of new 2023 capacity to network restoration and stronghold Southwest markets, which we consider to be lower-risk growth. We currently expect our route network to be approximately 90 percent restored by summer 2023, and fully restored by December 2023, compared with 2019 flight levels in pre-pandemic markets.""We continue to estimate full year 2023 operating expenses per available seat mile, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing3 (CASM-X) to decrease compared with full year 2022, which includes estimated wage rate accruals for all workgroups beginning April 1, 2022 and forward. Fleet utilization is expected to be limited by Pilot staffing constraints for the majority of 2023, resulting in continued cost headwinds due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels until we are able to optimize staffing with our fleet—which is foundational to our plan to improve operating leverage. Due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels and ongoing inflationary cost pressures, first half 2023 CASM-X3 is currently expected to be in the range of flat to up two percent compared with first half 2022. We currently expect our year-over-year capacity growth rate in second half 2023 to accelerate relative to our year-over-year capacity growth rate in first half 2023. As such, second half 2023 CASM-X3 is currently expected to decrease in the low-to-mid single digit range compared with second half 2022.""As we finalize our plan for next year, we remain laser-focused on our goals to grow full year 2023 profits and margins, excluding special items, year-over-year4, and to generate healthy returns on invested capital for our Shareholders.""Guidance and Outlook:The following tables introduce or update selected financial guidance for fourth quarter 2022 and full year 2022, as applicable:4Q 2022 EstimationOperating revenue compared with 2019 (a)Up 13% to 17%ASMs compared with 2019 (b)Down ~2%Economic fuel costs per gallon1,5$3.15 to $3.25Fuel hedging premium expense per gallon$0.03Fuel hedging cash settlement gains per gallon$0.37ASMs per gallon (fuel efficiency)77 to 79CASM-X compared with 20193Up 14% to 18%Scheduled debt repayments (millions)~$320Interest expense (millions)~$70 2022 EstimationPrevious estimationASMs compared with 2019 (b)Down ~4.5%Down ~4%Economic fuel costs per gallon1,5$3.05 to $3.15$2.95 to $3.05Fuel hedging premium expense per gallon$0.04No changeFuel hedging cash settlement gains per gallon$0.50$0.51CASM-X compared with 20193Up 14% to 15%Up 12% to 16%Scheduled debt repayments~$2.6 billion~$820 millionInterest expense (millions)~$340~$360Aircraft (c)768765Effective tax rate24% to 26%No changeCapital spending (billions) (d)~$4.0No change(a) The Company believes that operating revenues compared with 2019 is a relevant measure of performance due to the significant impacts in 2020 and 2021 from the pandemic.(b) Available seat miles (ASMs, or capacity). The Company's flight schedule is currently published for sale through July 10, 2023. The Company's fourth quarter 2022 guidance declined slightly from its previous estimation of down one percent to two percent, compared with fourth quarter 2019, primarily due to flight cancellations from the impact of Hurricane Ian. The Company continues to expect first quarter 2023 capacity to be up approximately 10 percent, compared with first quarter 2022, and currently expects second quarter 2023 capacity to be up approximately 14 percent, compared with second quarter 2022.(c) Aircraft on property, end of period. The Company ended third quarter 2022 with 742 Boeing 737 aircraft. During fourth quarter 2022, the Company continues to expect 31 Boeing 737 MAX 8 (-8) aircraft deliveries. The Company now expects to retire 26 Boeing 737-700 (-700) aircraft in 2022, including 5 -700 retirements in fourth quarter 2022, compared with its previous guidance of 29 -700 retirements this year. As a result, the Company now expects to end the year with 768 aircraft, compared with its previous guidance of 765 aircraft. The delivery schedule for the Boeing 737 MAX 7 (-7) is dependent on the Federal Aviation Administration (""FAA"") issuing required certifications and approvals to Boeing and the Company. The FAA will ultimately determine the timing of the -7 certification and entry into service, and the Company therefore offers no assurances that current estimations and timelines are correct. Furthermore, given the current ongoing status of the -7 certification and pace of expected deliveries for the remainder of this year, it is the Company's assumption that it will receive no -7 aircraft deliveries in 2022, and that the remaining 48 MAX aircraft reflected in its 2022 contractual order book will shift out of 2022.(d) Represents the Company's current expectation which assumes a total of 66 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2022. The Company continues to estimate $900 million in non-aircraft capital spending in 2022.Revenue Results and Outlook:Record third quarter 2022 operating revenues of $6.2 billion, a 10.3 percent increase compared with third quarter 2019—in line with the Company's previous guidanceThird quarter 2022 operating revenues per available seat mile (RASM, or unit revenues) increased 10.6 percent driven primarily by a passenger yield increase of 5.3 percent, coupled with a load factor increase of 1.9 points, all compared with third quarter 2019Third quarter 2022 managed business revenues were down 28 percent compared with third quarter 2019—in line with the Company's previous guidanceThe Company's revenue performance in third quarter 2022 was strong, despite a negative impact of approximately $18 million due to the flight disruptions caused by Hurricane Ian in late September 2022. This negative impact in third quarter 2022 was more than offset by improving leisure demand and close-in bookings in September 2022. In addition, the Company's third quarter 2022 operating revenues benefited from its loyalty program, including elevated point redemptions for flights and incremental revenue from its co-brand credit card agreement, as well as increased Upgraded Boarding take-rates following the new digital self-service launch in August 2022.As anticipated, the Company's third quarter 2022 operating revenues included a two point sequential operating revenue growth headwind from second quarter to third quarter 2022, compared with their respective 2019 levels, due to the increase in short-haul trips in business markets in an effort to support the reliability of its operational performance and expected business travel demand. While third quarter 2022 managed business revenues remained below 2019 levels, and softened in July and August compared with June 2022, the Company experienced sequential improvement from August to September, with September 2022 managed business revenues down 25 percent compared with September 2019 levels. Also, as anticipated, the Company's third quarter 2022 operating revenues included a five point sequential operating revenue growth headwind from second quarter to third quarter 2022, compared with their respective 2019 levels, due to a shift in the timing of recognition of breakage revenue associated with the Company's July 2022 policy change to eliminate expiration dates on qualifying flight credits6. The Company does not expect a material impact on fourth quarter 2022 operating revenues from either the increase in short-haul trips or its policy change to eliminate expiration dates on qualifying flight credits.Thus far, the Company continues to experience strong leisure and business revenue trends and strong bookings in fourth quarter 2022, including the holiday time periods, despite an estimated negative impact caused by Hurricane Ian of approximately $10 million. Based on current trends, fourth quarter 2022 operating revenues are expected to accelerate compared with third quarter 2022, both nominally and compared with their respective 2019 levels, and fourth quarter 2022 managed business revenues are estimated to be down in the range of 20 percent to 25 percent, compared with fourth quarter 2019.Fuel Costs and Outlook:Third quarter 2022 fuel costs were $3.34 per gallon1—in line with the Company's previous guidance—and included $0.02 per gallon in premium expense and $0.43 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contractsThird quarter 2022 fuel efficiency improved 1.5 percent compared with third quarter 2019 due to more MAX aircraft, the Company's most fuel-efficient aircraft, as a percentage of its fleetAs of October 19, 2022, the fair market value of the Company's fuel derivative contracts settling in fourth quarter 2022 through the end of 2024 was an asset of $685 millionThe Company's multi-year fuel hedging program continues to provide insurance against spikes in energy prices and significantly offset the market price increase in jet fuel in third quarter 2022. The Company's current fuel derivative contracts contain a combination of instruments based in West Texas Intermediate, Brent crude oil, and refined products, such as heating oil.

However, the Company's third quarter 2022 CASM-X increase was on the lower end of its previous guidance range primarily due to lower than anticipated healthcare and benefits costs, as well as favorable airport settlements received during third quarter 2022, which the Company previously expected to receive in fourth quarter 2022.The Company continues to experience inflationary cost pressures in fourth quarter 2022, in particular with higher rates for labor, benefits, and airports. Fourth quarter 2022 costs are also pressured by the shifting of favorable airport settlements into third quarter 2022, as well as increased cost headwinds due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels. Headcount is expected to increase further in fourth quarter 2022 to support plans for network restoration in 2023, while capacity levels are expected to decline seasonally in fourth quarter 2022 compared with third quarter 2022, relative to their respective 2019 levels. The Company remains on track with its goal this year to add more than 10,000 new Employees, net of attrition.Third quarter 2022 net interest expense, which is included in Other expenses, decreased $99 million, year-over-year, primarily due to a $68 million year-over-year increase in interest income driven primarily by higher interest rates, coupled with a $29 million year-over-year decrease in interest expense primarily due to various debt repurchases throughout 2022, as well as elimination of the debt discount as a result of the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity.Fleet and Capital Spending:The Company received 23 -8 aircraft during third quarter 2022, as expected, for a year-to-date total of 35 -8 aircraft deliveries received as of September 30, 2022. The Company ended third quarter 2022 with 742 aircraft, which reflects 11 -700 aircraft retirements during the quarter. While the Company remains contractually scheduled to receive 114 MAX deliveries this year, the Company continues to expect a portion of its deliveries to shift out of 2022 due to Boeing's supply chain challenges and the current status of the -7 certification. Based on continued discussions with Boeing regarding the pace of expected deliveries for the remainder of this year, the Company continues to estimate it will receive a total of 66 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2022, including 31 -8 deliveries in fourth quarter 2022, and no -7 deliveries in 2022. The Company now expects to retire 26 -700 aircraft in 2022, including 5 -700 retirements in fourth quarter 2022, compared with its previous guidance of 29 -700 retirements. As a result, the Company now expects to end the year with 768 aircraft, compared with its previous guidance of 765 aircraft.The Company's third quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $1.1 billion driven primarily by aircraft-related capital spending, as well as technology, facilities, and operational investments. The Company continues to estimate its 2022 capital spending to be approximately $4.0 billion, which assumes a total of 66 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2022. The Company's 2022 capital spending guidance continues to include approximately $900 million in non-aircraft capital spending.Since the Company's previous disclosure on July 28, 2022, the Company exercised the remaining five -8 options for delivery in 2022 and exercised the remaining four -7 options for delivery in 2023. Additionally in October 2022, the Company converted 17 2023 -7 firm orders to -8 firm orders; exercised three -7 options for delivery in 2024; accelerated 15 -7 firm orders from 2030 into 2026; and accelerated 10 -8 firm orders from 2031 into 2030. The following tables provide further information regarding the Company's contractual order book and compare its contractual order book as of October 27, 2022, with its previous order book as of July 28, 2022. Given current supply chain and aircraft delivery delays, the Company will continue working with Boeing to solidify future delivery dates.Current 737 Contractual Order Book as of October 27, 2022:The Boeing Company-7 Firm Orders-8 Firm Orders-7 or -8 OptionsTotal202214100—114(c)20232565—90202433—5386202530—56862026301540852027151563620281515—3020292030—502030—55—552031————182(a)295(b)155632(a) The delivery timing for the -7 is dependent on the FAA issuing required certifications and approvals to Boeing and the Company. The FAA will ultimately determine the timing of the -7 certification and entry into service, and the Company therefore offers no assurances that current estimations and timelines are correct.(b) The Company has flexibility to designate firm orders or options as -7s or -8s, upon written advance notification as stated in the contract.(c) Includes 35 -8 deliveries received through September 30, 2022 and 31 expected -8 deliveries in fourth quarter 2022, for a total of 66 -8 deliveries in 2022. Thus far, the Company has received a total of 40 -8 deliveries in 2022. While the Company is contractually scheduled to receive 114 MAX deliveries, including options, this year, a portion of its deliveries are expected to shift out of 2022 due to Boeing's supply chain challenges and the current status of the -7 certification. Furthermore, given the current ongoing status of the -7 certification and pace of expected deliveries for the remainder of this year, it is the Company's assumption that it will receive no -7 aircraft deliveries in 2022, and has the ability to convert -7s to -8s as noted in footnote (b).Previous 737 Contractual Order Book as of July 28, 2022 (a): The Boeing Company-7 Firm Orders-8 Firm Orders-7 or -8 OptionsTotal20221495511420233848490202430—5686202530—56862026151540702027151563620281515—3020292030—5020301545—602031—10—10192273167632(a) The 'Previous 737 Contractual Order Book' is for reference and comparative purposes only.

Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$111, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, for US$8.3m worth of shares, at about US$111 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$89.58. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock.

The average reefer rate was down 5 cents to $2.84 per mile, and the average flatbed rate dropped 14 cents to $3.64 per mile.Spot truckload rates are negotiated for each load and paid to the carrier by a freight broker. DAT bases its rate analysis on $137 billion in annualized freight transactions.""The usual peak period for van freight looks more like a mesa,"" said Ken Adamo, DAT Chief of Analytics. ""The month-over-month decline in September truckload volume suggests that many retailers already have inventory in position, have tempered their expectations for the holidays, or some combination of the two.""Load-to-truck ratios declineThe national average van load-to-truck ratio was 3.5, unchanged from August, meaning there were 3.5 available loads for every van posted to the DAT One load board network. The reefer load-to-truck ratio was 6.3, down from 7.1, and the flatbed ratio fell to 13.3, down from 14.1 in August.Demand for trucks increased ahead of Hurricane Ian making landfall on Sept. 28. The number of loads posted to the DAT One network headed to distribution hubs in the Southeast rose 20% during the week before the storm’s arrival.Story continuesContract rates dippedThe national average shipper-to-broker contract van rate declined for the fourth consecutive month, falling 3 cents to $3.09 a mile. The average contract reefer rate was $3.40 a mile last month, unchanged from August, while the average contract rate for flatbed freight dropped 5 cents to $3.64 a mile.About the DAT Truckload Volume IndexThe DAT Truckload Volume Index reflects the change in the number of loads with a pickup date during that month; the actual index number is normalized each month to accommodate any new data sources without distortion. A baseline of 100 equals the number of loads moved in January 2015, as recorded in DAT RateView, a database of rates paid on an average of 3 million loads per month. DAT national average spot rates are derived from RateView and include only over-the-road lanes with lengths of haul of 250 miles or more. Spot rates represent the payments made to carriers by freight brokers, third-party logistics providers and other transportation buyers.About DAT Freight &amp; AnalyticsDAT Freight &amp; Analytics operates the largest truckload freight marketplace in North America. Shippers, transportation brokers, motor carriers, news organizations and industry analysts rely on DAT for market trends and data insights derived from more than 500 million freight matches in 2022 and a database of $137 billion in market transactions.Founded in 1978, DAT is a wholly owned subsidiary of Roper Technologies (NYSE:ROP), a diversified technology company and constituent of the S&amp;P 500, Fortune 500 and Russell 1000 indices.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions.

110,eaa38ca5-9503-338c-a2a5-8a4ef8fcf445,WU,2022-10-27,FleetCor Technologies (FLT) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fleetcor-technologies-flt-earnings-expected-140102965.html,1666792862,STORY,"['FLT', 'WU']","[FleetCor Technologies (FLT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis provider of fuel card and payment products for businesses is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19%.Revenues are expected to be $877.61 million, up 16.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.64% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FleetCor Technologies?For FleetCor Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.99%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that FleetCor Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that FleetCor Technologies would post earnings of $3.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.17, delivering a surprise of +7.20%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.FleetCor Technologies appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, Western Union (WU) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.42 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -33.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.09 billion, down 15.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Western Union has been revised 10.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.85%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Western Union will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, today announced its fourth annual ""Crush the Crisis"" national opioid take back day to raise awareness about the dangers of opioid misuse and the importance of safe and proper disposal of unused or expired medications, on Saturday, October 29, 2022.More than 100 HCA Healthcare facilities across the country will partner with local law enforcement to help communities safely, responsibly and anonymously collect unused and expired medication. The event coincides with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) National Prescription Drug Take Back Day.""We have made great strides in fighting the opioid crisis plaguing our country, but there is still work to be done,"" said Dr. Randy Fagin, chief medical officer of HCA Healthcare’s National Group. ""We are looking forward to building off the previous success of ‘Crush the Crisis’, as HCA Healthcare continues to fight against opioid misuse and addiction.""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were more than 107,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2021, up nearly 15 percent from 2020. The 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed a majority of misused prescription drugs were obtained from family and friends, often from the home medicine cabinet. Last year, ""Crush the Crisis"" take back events collected 15,566 pounds of unused or expired medication, approximately 10.7 million doses.To further help combat the nation’s opioid crisis, HCA Healthcare has worked with the National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) Action Collaborative on Countering the U.S. Opioid Epidemic. HCA Healthcare has given $750,000 to the Collaborative to support the development of safer pain management protocols and reversal of the opioid crisis.As a learning health system, HCA Healthcare uses data from approximately 35 million annual patient encounters to help continuously improve care.

UHS reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $2.54 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. However, the bottom line fell 4.9% year over year.UHS’ quarterly results benefited from higher patient admissions at its acute care and behavioral health care facilities. Despite seeing an uptrend, growth in patient volumes in the behavioral health care segment was partly offset by the issue of shortage of nurses and other medical personnel that continues to grapple most U.S. healthcare providers.Consequently, the margins of Universal Health took a hit as it had to incur elevated labor costs in the form of recruiting expensive temporary personnel or raising wages and benefits to attract and retain nurses and other clinical staff to counter the staffing scarcity.Universal Health Services, Inc.

(NYSE:GS) institutional investors after losing 18% over the previous year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-week-goldman-sachs-group-140057942.html,1666792857,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[A look at the shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would appreciate the 5.9% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 18%.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Goldman Sachs Group. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Goldman Sachs Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Goldman Sachs Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Goldman Sachs Group. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 7.1% and 6.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$553m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Goldman Sachs Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

FX, but lowered EPS by 6% at the mid-point, as the Q4 gross margin will be impacted by promotions to move inventory.POS in North America in 3Q22 was down mid-single digits, worse than the overall toy industry because Mattel is under-indexed in currently higher growth segments like plush and trading cards.The toy maker expects high advertising &amp; promotional spending in 4Q22 to drive an acceleration in POS late in the quarter, as consumers are expected to return to traditional buying very close to Christmas versus much earlier buying in 2021, the analyst noted.The toy industry is highly competitive with low entry barriers, making it difficult for the company to achieve, maintain, or build upon its successful brands and products.Another challenge for the company due to high levels of competition is securing, maintaining, and renewing licenses for popular entertainment products, said the analyst.Mattel's business is highly seasonal, and its operating performance relies heavily on sales during the brief holiday season.The analyst specified that any disruptions to the company's results during this time, such as the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of less popular toys with consumers, would negatively impact sales.The analyst also noted that consumer interests in the toy industry are rapidly changing, which makes it challenging to design toys that will be popular with children and families.Price Action: MAT shares are trading higher by 0.76% at $19.92 on the last check Wednesday.Photo Via CompanyLatest Ratings for MATDateFirmActionFromToFeb 2022StifelUpgradesHoldBuyJan 2022DA DavidsonMaintainsBuyJan 2022MKM PartnersUpgradesNeutralBuyView More Analyst Ratings for MATStory continuesView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaMattel Shares Drop After FY22 Earnings Guidance Cut, Mixed Q3 ResultsMattel Agrees To Pay $3.5M To Settle SEC Charges Over Financial MisstatementsMusk On Housing Bubble Burst: 'They Dug Their Own Graves – A Lesson We Should All Take To Heart' - TeslaDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Mattel Chairman and CEO Ynon Kreiz joins us now to discuss. Ynon, always great to get some time with you. Your top takeaway on the quarter?YNON KREIZ: Thank you, Brian, for inviting me. Well, this was a good quarter for Mattel, with the ninth straight quarter of year-over-year growth in constant currency. Look, as you know, we are in the midst of a challenging economic environment.But our year-to-date results of double-digit growth in net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS showed that we are successfully navigating a complex landscape, and our strategy is working. We believe the fundamentals are strong. And we are very confident about our multiyear growth trajectory.BRIAN SOZZI: Ynon, I've been covering you and the turnaround story of Mattel for a good bit now. I wasn't used to that tone on that conference call last night just highlighting some slowing you're seeing in the market. How severe has that gotten?YNON KREIZ: Look, there's no-- it's not a secret that the economy, the broader economy, is currently challenging. But our year-to-date results do show and do demonstrate that we are on the right track. We are maintaining guidance for full-year growth in net sales in constant currency of 8% to 10% and look forward to the holiday season.We modestly revised our profit expectation to allow and accommodate for the inflation that we're seeing. But we still expect a growth year for Mattel, both at the top line and the bottom line, and also expect 2023 to be a growth year, both top line and bottom line. So we are very confident about our trajectory. Our brands are resonating, thriving with continued engagement and cultural impact. And we're very confident about our strategy and execution.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: You did highlight the need that there might be a little more promotions in the holiday quarter than I think a lot of investors maybe expected. How much discounting do you expect to be doing?YNON KREIZ: Look, quarter-to-date, consumer demand is in line with expectation, and we're pleased with our performance. Shoppers are returning to traditional purchasing patterns closer to the holiday, and we expect demand to accelerate. We are working closely with our retail partners to meet the anticipated demand. We have more advertising and promotion.We secured more shelf space and retailer support compared to last year. And we also expect to-- and also, we have great holiday toys representation and much stronger in-stock. So, yes, we are going to increase activity, promotional activity, but we are well-positioned for the fourth quarter and the holiday season, which is why we are maintaining our full-year guidance of net sales growth in 8% to 10% in constant currency.BRIAN SOZZI: Ynon, I'm old. I'm not as cool as I used to be. What are some of the top toys this holiday season?YNON KREIZ: Well, Monster High is going to be a very exciting offering as we prepare for the global launch next year, Hot Wheels Car Wash, Lightyear products. Fisher-Price has a great musical toy called Bouncin' Beads. And the Dreamhouse, of course, will always be on the top of the toy list for every holiday season. So an exciting broad offering across a pretty large spectrum of product that we're very excited about.BRIAN SOZZI: I remember having one of those car washes as a kid, Ynon. I've got to send you-- a photo exists somewhere. But these are some cool toys. That is some interesting stuff. How is the pricing on these compared to last year? Do you plan to take more pricing?YNON KREIZ: Look, we increased pricing in the second half of this year. We were able to successfully implement those increases. And it's too early to tell, but so far, we haven't seen a meaningful impact on consumer demand. Important to say that as it relates to inflation, we are beginning to see some improvement in the cost of ocean freight and materials.We expect inflation to moderate in 2023. And in addition to the savings that we're looking to generate of $250 million by the end of '23, we expect the combination of pricing and cost savings to more than offset cost inflation and contribute to margin expansion over time. So we are proactively managing our business in this environment to ensure that we are set up for long-term success.BRIAN SOZZI: Ynon, you might be the first CEO that we've talked to, to really highlight a peak in inflation and things cooling off a bit. I certainly-- certainly that is good to hear and a different tone. Let's go into Barbie because Barbie's been an interesting story the past year or two here, a real growth mechanism for the company. What's on tap for that brand next year?YNON KREIZ: We're very confident about the long-term growth trajectory of Barbie. Barbie was the number one global doll property in the third quarter and year-to-date. Year-to-date, Barbie is up with-- which is an excellent achievement when compared to last year, which was the highest on record for Barbie of all times. We look forward to next year, which will have an exciting innovation pipeline and new content slate with Netflix and, of course, the highly anticipated ""Barbie"" movie, our first theatrical release that will come out this summer.Also, important to note that Barbie doubled in size over the past five years and was the number one global toy property overall, not just in dolls, but overall in the last two years. And we really see that as a proof point to the strength of this incredible franchise. Very confident about Barbie and proud to have it as our leading franchise.BRIAN SOZZI: It does seem like, Ynon-- and we've talked about this in the past-- you've-- all the seeds that you have planted in terms of content and, of course, you highlight the ""Barbie"" movie, are now coming to fruition. This will start to hit the market next year and beyond. How much will you spend on content next year?YNON KREIZ: Well, we employ a capital light strategy. We're not spending money on content. We are leveraging our brands. We collaborate with the best filmmakers and content creators out there, both-- not just film, but also in television, and partner with major studios to create, produce, distribute, and commercialize our brands on the big screen, and also in episodic content.We have a very exciting slate of 14 additional movies other than ""Barbie"" that we are currently developing with some of the best and most prolific creators of this generation. And this is going to grow because we have more in the pipeline that we haven't announced. And, likewise, Mattel Television is thriving with 12 series and specials that will be on air this year, so to speak, because some are actually via streaming.Eight of those are new, four are returning. ""Monster High"" live action television movie musical just launched on Nickelodeon, and we greenlit the second movie. And we continue to roll out more content, such as Thomas and Friends, Polly Pocket, Fireman Sam, depends on new-- more Barbie product, Pictionary game show, and the list goes on and on. So exciting to see how our brands resonate with consumers and attract creators to collaborate with us because like us, they are also very excited to reimagine and create an expression of product in content.BRIAN SOZZI: When's the ""Pokémon"" movie hitting, Ynon?YNON KREIZ: Well, we licensed recently the Pokémon brand, which is one of the strongest franchises this year. For MEGA, for building sets, it's been a great driver for us. And we're very proud to work with The Pokémon Company in expressing their IP in combination with our products. So it's a great partnership.And this really speaks to how we elevate Mattel to become the partner of choice for the major entertainment companies and where we bring our capabilities, our global scale, our innovation, our supply chain, and commercial capabilities, collaborate with other owners, other franchises, and take them to the next level and create evergreen franchises, just like we do with our own.BRIAN SOZZI: I'm just being flagged. Before I let you go, Ynon, there was just a new Pokémon movie, ""Detective Pikachu."" That's how you're getting old when you do not realize those types of movies are in the market. We'll leave it there for now. Good luck this holiday season. Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz, we'll talk to you soon.YNON KREIZ: Thank you so much.]"

MAT delivered third-quarter 2022 results, wherein its earnings and revenues surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The metrics beat the consensus mark for the tenth consecutive quarter but declined on a year-over-year basis.Despite reporting better-than-expected results, the company’s shares declined 5.5% in the after-hours trading session on Oct 25. Investors’ sentiment was hurt as the company trimmed its 2022 earnings per share guidance.After the results, Ynon Kreiz, Mattel’s chairman and CEO, stated, “Our results reflect the resilience of our diversified portfolio and the success in executing our strategy, despite the challenging macro-economic environment. We look forward to the all-important holiday season, and believe we are on track to achieve another growth year for the company.”Earnings &amp; Revenues DiscussionDuring the third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 82 cents compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 84 cents.Net sales during the quarter amounted to $1,755.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,748 million. The top line declined 0.4% year over year. However, on a constant-currency (cc) basis, sales improved 3% from the prior-year quarter.In North America, gross billings declined 4% (as reported and at constant currency) year over year. The decline was primarily due to the dismal performance of Infant, Toddler, and Preschool (including Fisher-Price and Thomas &amp; Friends), Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, Other (primarily Games and Other) and Dolls (including Barbie). Net sales in the North America segment declined 3% year over year on a reported and cc basis.In the International segment, gross billings rose 4% (reported) and 13% (cc) year over year. The uptick was driven by growth in Vehicles (including Hot Wheels), Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other (including Lightyear and Jurassic World). However, it was partially offset by Dolls (including Spirit and Barbie) and Infant, Toddler, and Preschool (including Fisher-Price and Thomas &amp; Friends). Net Sales in the International segment increased 5% on a reported basis and 13% at cc year over year.Mattel, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMattel, Inc.

These items are grouped under different brands — Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, Thomas &amp; Friends and Other.Worldwide gross billings by Mattel Power Brands decreased 1% year over year to $1,948 million.

Gross billings at Other increased 2% (on a reported basis) and 6% (at cc) year over year.Operating ResultsAdjusted gross margin expanded 50 basis points year over year to 48.3% due to pricing and savings from the Optimizing for Growth program, marginally overshadowed by input cost inflation as well as increased royalty expense.During the quarter under discussion, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses decreased $1 million year over year to $323 million. The decrease can primarily be attributed to a decline in incentive compensation and savings from the Optimizing for Growth program.Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, 2022, the company’s cash and equivalents were $349 million compared with $148.5 million as of Sep 30, 2021.

Recently, SLB's 50-day simple moving average broke out above its 200-day moving average; this is known as a ""golden cross.""A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that can signify a potential bullish breakout. It's formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average breaking above a longer-term moving average, with the most common moving averages being the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.A successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum.A golden cross contrasts with a death cross, another widely-followed chart pattern that suggests bearish momentum could be on the horizon.SLB has rallied 54.4% over the past four weeks, and the company is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank at the moment. This combination indicates SLB could be poised for a breakout.Once investors consider SLB's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months compared to 6 revisions higher, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased as well.Moving Average Chart for SLBGiven this move in earnings estimates and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on SLB for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

128,5af427a5-fecb-36ae-987f-a943fc97bb25,SLB,2022-10-27,Schlumberger Limited (SLB) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limited-slb-trending-stock-130001928.html,1666789201,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +54.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 21.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +65.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.12 points to a change of +65.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.94 indicates a change of +38.6% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Schlumberger is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SLB _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $7.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24.2%. The $27.81 billion and $32.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.3% and +16.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.9%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.36 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.14 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.67%. The EPS surprise was +14.55%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company offers turbochargers, emissions systems, thermal systems, and gasoline ignition technology, among much more. It is based in Auburn Hills, Michigan.John Murphy, an analyst at Bank of America, holds a $75 price target on shares of BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:BWA) as of September 9. The analyst also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock.Story continuesThis August, BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:BWA) beat consensus estimates in its second-quarter earnings results with a 7% increase in organic sales during the quarter. The company's guidance for the rest of the year remains strong despite inflation fears, as it expects full-year organic sales to rise by 11% to 14%, and its EPS to land between $4 to $4.4, versus the $4.02 consensus.

(NYSE:BWA) in its fourth-quarter 2021 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“We had the opportunity to purchase BorgWarner for a high single-digit multiple of our estimate of normal earnings due to elevated cyclical concerns and uncertainty about the longer term impact of powertrain electrification on the business. Currently, the company’s earnings are depressed due to semiconductor supply constraints that are impacting the entire industry. We expect these constraints to prove transitory, and we’re confident that component shortages will be resolved in the coming years. Furthermore, we believe that OEMs are likely to rely heavily on third-party suppliers, like BorgWarner, to leverage R&amp;D expenses to enhance innovation and speed-to-market in an electrified world. For decades, we’ve been impressed with how BorgWarner management has successfully acquired and scaled fuel efficiency technologies for internal combustion engines. We see strong parallels and underappreciated potential in the acquisitions the company has made over the past 5+ years in key electric vehicle technologies. We believe the company is well-positioned to manufacture and integrate new propulsion systems and components to meet customer demands.”BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:BWA), like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc.

132,4ec6b119-629b-3226-8258-db1f86b12e54,AIG,2022-10-27,MGIC Investment (MTG) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mgic-investment-mtg-earnings-expected-140102259.html,1666792862,STORY,"['MTG', 'AIG']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when MGIC Investment (MTG) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis mortgage insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.55 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.6%.Revenues are expected to be $322.19 million, up 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MGIC?For MGIC, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MGIC will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MGIC would post earnings of $0.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering a surprise of +50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MGIC doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, American International Group (AIG), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -15.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $11.5 billion, down 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for American International Group has been revised 6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -27.87%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American International Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""As a result of this effort, some employees have been given new assignments in their current location, while some have been offered positions at other sites and some positions have been eliminated.""Fallas offered no other details about the layoffs.The job cuts affect a small number of salaried employees in management and upper-level technical services workers at several locations.

145,076b790f-926a-3b81-9de8-de85ecceaf4c,PSX,2022-10-27,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-131001396.html,1666789801,STORY,"['PEBO', 'PSX']","[Here's an eye-opening statistic: older Americans are more afraid of running out of money than of death itself.And unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.Retirement investing approaches of the past don't work today.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesA rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.NexPoint Residential Trust Inc. (NXRT) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.32%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.41% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 11.36%. Check NexPoint Residential Trust Inc. (NXRT) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Peoples Bancorp (PEBO) is paying out a dividend of $0.38 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 5.32% compared to the Banks - Midwest industry's yield of 2.42% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 5.56% over the past year. Check Peoples Bancorp (PEBO) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.97 per share, Phillips 66 (PSX) has a dividend yield of 3.87%. This is compared to the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry's yield of 1.7% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 7.78%. Check Phillips 66 (PSX) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil refiner have returned +31.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Phillips 66 belongs, has gained 17.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $4.98 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.41 points to a change of +205.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.76 indicates a change of -32.5% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Phillips 66 is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate of $35.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.1%. The $136.99 billion and $129.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.3% and -5.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $49.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +76.8%. EPS of $6.77 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.37 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +43.48%. The EPS surprise was +14.36%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals.

Year to date, SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) is down 36% compared to a 21% decline in the S&amp;P 500. The silver lining here is that investors have the opportunity to purchase undervalued retail stocks while their shares are on sale.  To be sure, the signs remain mixed for the sector. Consumer sentiment is poor, even after rebounding slightly. Yet, holiday retail sales are expected to increase by 4% to 6% this year, according to Deloitte. For investors who are ready to wade back into the sector, consider doing so with these undervalued retail stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWMTWalmart$136.80TJXTJX Companies$67.61CHWYChewy$37.38DGDollar General$239.37DLTRDollar Tree$143.61AMZNAmazon$119.32ULTAUlta Beauty$382.81Undervalued Retail Stocks: Walmart (WMT)Walmart sign on front of Walmart store at sundownSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is the largest retailer in the world by revenue, generating $208 billion more than No. 2 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), according to a March report by the National Retail Federation. Walmart’s scale simply cannot be discounted. In general, the larger the company, the greater its cost savings. Walmart customers inherently recognize this advantage when comparing Walmart’s prices with those of other retailers. WMT stock has held up much better than the broader market this year, down just 5.5%. But it fell sharply following the release of the company’s fiscal first-quarter results in mid-May. Shares lost more than a third of their value in a single day after a rare earnings miss. Luckily, fiscal Q2 results were much better, with the company beating estimates on the top and bottom lines and reiterating its full-year forecast.Walmart is resilient and should continue to draw in shoppers across all income groups as a recession looms.Story continuesTJX Companies (TJX)An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.comTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) appears to be navigating the economic downturn well. Shares of the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods have outperformed the retail sector, down just 11% year to date.While second-quarter sales slipped 1.4% from a year ago, revenue for the first half of the year was up nearly 5%. Moreover, despite the Q2 sales decline, net income increased by 3%. Therefore, the company seems well-equipped to handle the current retail environment.  What’s more, the company creates value for shareholders as measured by its weighted average cost of capital of 8.1% versus return on invested capital of 19.2%. The company’s strategy of offering branded goods to customers at discounted prices should continue to work well as consumers look to stretch their more limited discretionary dollars, especially during the upcoming holiday season. Undervalued Retail Stocks: Chewy (CHWY)chewy website zoomed in on the logoSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comOnline pet retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) was a pandemic star that has come back down to Earth. That’s not a bad thing, though, at least not for investors looking for undervalued retail stocks to buy. For the second quarter, Chewy reported net sales of $2.43 billion, up 12.8% year over year. That was slightly below the $2.45 billion Wall Street expected. However, Chewy reported a surprise profit of 5 cents per share. Analysts had been calling for a 12-cent per-share loss for the quarter.CHWY stock dropped anyway, falling 8% in a single day. The problem was the company’s guidance. Management’s forecasts for Q3 and the full year were below what analysts had been expecting.  While economic uncertainty is causing pet owners to curtail spending, the overall trend in pet spending is clearly to the upside. Morgan Stanley forecasts pet spending will triple between 2021 and 2030. CHWY stock is down 37% so far this year. This buy-the-dip opportunity is too good to ignore. Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDollar General (NYSE:DG) was made for this kind of economy. In fact, its CEO recently said that its stores are attracting wealthier shoppers looking to save money. Dollar General’s sales rose 9% year over year in the second quarter and were up 6.6% in the first half of 2022.The company is expanding rapidly, increasing its square footage by 5.6% in the first half of the year and opening 466 new stores. And it plans to repurchase $2.75 billion worth of shares. That means current shareholders will see the value of their shares increase. Analysts are calling for revenue growth of 10.7% this year to $37.9 billion. Earnings are expected to grow 13.8% to $11.57 per share.DG stock is up 1.5% for the year, which is an indication of its ability to thrive in a tough economic environment. However, shares look cheap based on analysts’ estimates. With an average price target of $268.55, analysts are predicting shares could rise 12% from current levels. The most optimistic price target of $296 implies upside of nearly 24%. In other words, there’s still time to buy DG stock.Undervalued Retail Stocks: Dollar Tree (DLTR)store front of a Dollar Tree location with green signageSource: shutterstock.com/Jonathan WeissDollar Tree (NYSE:DLTR) is a competitor to Dollar General, but in this economy, there is plenty of room for both deep-discount retailers. Dollar Tree, which also operates Family Dollar stores, is the smaller of the two, generating about 25% less revenue than Dollar General over the past 12 months. In the first half of 2022, Dollar Tree’s revenue and net income both increased by 6.6% year over year. DLTR stock is up 2.2% year to date. However, based on analysts’ average price target of $168.26, it has further to run than DG stock. The mean target implies upside of 17%, while the high target of $195 suggests shares could deliver a 36% return.Both DLTR and DG are worthy investments for those looking for undervalued retail stocks to buy as consumers tighten their purse strings. Amazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark backgroundSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comConventional thinking states that when the economy is in trouble, the world’s second-largest retailer — Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) — will suffer. Indeed, AMZN stock is trading near a two-year low, and its price-to-book ratio is near a 10-year low.Yet, discerning investors should ask themselves whether Amazon is really in trouble or whether its issues are the result of it being the leader in e-commerce cyclical retail. My guess is that it’s the latter.Despite its massive footprint, Amazon’s three-year revenue growth rate is better than 87% of retailers. And analysts predict the company will generate double-digit revenue growth this year and next. When the economy begins to expand once again, AMZN stock is likely to rocket higher. Based on analysts’ average price target of $163.95, shares could rally by as much as 37%.Undervalued Retail Stocks: Ulta Beauty (ULTA)ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.comBeauty products retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), fittingly enough, is benefitting from a phenomenon known as the lipstick effect. The lipstick effect refers to the idea that consumers spend more on small indulgences, like cosmetics, during recessionary periods as higher-priced luxuries become less attainable. During the first half of the year, Ulta Beauty’s revenue increased 19% year over year to $4.6 billion, and the company opened 17 new stores.  Ulta Beauty is a highly profitable company with metrics including return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital that are all in the 95th percentile or better for the retail industry.ULTA stock is down 7% year to date. Analysts’ average price target of $487.08 implies upside of 27% for shares of the largest beauty retailer in the United States. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

150,eb0d3eec-a356-3269-9bce-ad27f194643d,NEM,2022-10-27,Newmont (NEM) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-nem-report-q3-earnings-101810685.html,1666865890,STORY,"['NEM', 'KOP']","[Newmont Corporation NEM is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results before the opening bell on Nov 1.The gold miner missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while beat the same once. For this timeframe, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of roughly 9.8%, on average. Newmont posted a negative earnings surprise of 23.3% in the last reported quarter.The company’s third-quarter results are expected to reflect improved grades across a number of mines. However, lower gold prices are likely to have affected its performance. The stock has lost 20.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 15.2% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter consolidated revenues for Newmont is currently pegged at $2,790 million, which calls for a decline of around 3.6% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter average realized prices of gold stands at $1,750, suggesting a 1.6% year-over-year decrease and a 4.7% decline on a sequential comparison basis. The same for the attributable gold production is pegged at 1.56 million ounces, indicating a 7.6% year-over-year increase and a 4.6% sequential rise.Some Factors to Watch ForImproved production performance is expected to have supported the company’s third-quarter results. In South America, the Merian mine is likely to have delivered higher production on improved mill performance and higher ore grade. Cerro Negro is expected to have delivered improved productivity.Performance at Penasquito in North America is also likely to remain strong in the third quarter, aided by higher grades. Musselwhite is also expected to have delivered improved productivity and grades. In Australia, performance across Tanami and Boddington mines is likely to have been aided by higher ore grades in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesStrong production across Akyem and Ahafo, driven by higher ore grade, is also expected to have driven results in the company’s Africa operation in the September quarter.Meanwhile, gold prices lost the momentum since the second quarter. Gold rallied roughly 8% in the first quarter of 2022, thanks to rapidly rising inflation, higher interest rates and uncertainties surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Amid the economic uncertainties, weakness in equity markets and increased volatility, gold stood out as an effective hedge.However, gold prices erased the gains and closed the second quarter roughly 7% lower. The downdrift continued in the third quarter with prices falling around 8% in the quarter. Higher bond yields, interest rate hikes, geopolitical instability and a sharp rally in the U.S. dollar weighed on gold prices.Lower year-over-year average realized gold prices are expected to have weighed on Newmont’s performance in the September quarter. Newmont Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Newmont Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNewmont Corporation price-eps-surprise | Newmont Corporation Quote Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Newmont this season.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis mining company is expected to post break-even quarterly earnings per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -100%.Revenues are expected to be $325.06 million, down 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 24.85% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for HudBay Minerals?For HudBay Minerals, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2,299.98%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that HudBay Minerals will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that HudBay Minerals would post earnings of $0.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of +9.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

This compares to earnings of $3.07 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.16%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this defense contractor would post earnings of $2.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.75, delivering a surprise of 1.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.General Dynamics , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, posted revenues of $9.98 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.56%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $9.57 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.General Dynamics shares have added about 17.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for General Dynamics?While General Dynamics has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for General Dynamics: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.63 on $10.91 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $12.16 on $39.39 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Aerospace - Defense is currently in the bottom 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Textron (TXT), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 27.This maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Textron's revenues are expected to be $3.21 billion, up 7.3% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

160,d4f9d233-ab51-30e0-a4be-b9a8451539b9,GD,2022-10-27,International Seaways and Whirlpool Corporation have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-seaways-whirlpool-corporation-highlighted-114311694.html,1666784591,STORY,"['WHR', 'BA', 'INSW', 'GD', 'TDY']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 26, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares International Seaways INSW as the Bull of the Day and Whirlpool Corporation WHR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Teledyne Technologies TDY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:International Seaways, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of this year's biggest market winners. INSW hit an all-time high in price this month in a sign of strength, all while most stocks hover in bear market territory. The company's longevity and continued stock price ascent speak to management's ability to adapt to the ever-changing market landscape. INSW sports a 'B' rating for our Zacks Momentum Style Score, indicating a strong likelihood that the stock propels higher on the powerful combination of positive earnings estimate revisions and stock price performance.International Seaways is part of the Zacks Transportation – Shipping industry, which is currently ranked in the top 16% out of over 250 industries. This group has widely outperformed the market with a 29% return year-to-date.Despite shipping rates coming down from their peak, companies within the shipping industry have continued to flourish. While an absence of high congestion has established a path to lower rates, any changes in China's Covid-zero policy or possible ceasefire agreements in the Russia-Ukraine war have the potential to lift rates again.Why has this group continued to shine despite lower shipping rates? Two reasons – accelerated earnings growth and relative undervaluation. Historical research has illustrated that roughly half of a stock's future price movement can be attributed to its industry group. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform over the next 3 to 6 months. By focusing on stocks within the top industries, we can provide a constant 'tailwind' to our investing success.Story continuesThe industry also boasts a large number of highly ranked stocks per our Zacks Rank, serving as another confirmation signal that this group is a great place to be. Let's take a deeper look at this leading stock.Company DescriptionInternational Seaways owns and operates a fleet of over 80 oceangoing vessels and is engaged in the global transportation of crude oil and petroleum products. INSW serves independent and state-owned oil companies, oil traders, refinery operators, and international government entities.As we saw in recent weeks with the release of September's CPI data, inflation is going to linger. While the Fed has gone into overdrive with rate hikes, even committee officials have acknowledged that they've done little to stem a 40-year high in inflation. That's good news for shipping companies, as they're able to charge higher rates and pass along the higher costs of doing business.Earnings Trends and Future Estimates INSW has surpassed earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters, delivering a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.31%. The shipping company most recently reported Q2 EPS back in August of $1.43/share, a 17.21% beat over the $1.22 consensus estimate. Consistently beating earnings estimates by a wide margin will generally help boost the stock price over time.Analysts have increased their EPS estimates for INSW across the board. For the third quarter, estimates have been revised upward by 13.85% in the past 30 days. The Q3 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $2.22 per share, translating to astonishing potential growth of 452.37% relative to the same quarter last year.What the Zacks Model Unveils The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) identifies companies that have recently witnessed positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that this more recent information can serve as a better predictor of the future, giving investors a leg up during earnings season. When combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better with a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time according to our 10-year backtest.With an Earnings ESP +3.34% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, another earnings beat may be in the cards for INSW investors when the company reports Q3 results on November 8th.Let's Get TechnicalINSW shares have advanced nearly 180% this year. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to make this type of price move while the market makes a series of lower lows. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages slope up and have acted as support this year throughout the bullish move. The stock has been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, INSW is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, International Seaways has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and INSW continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run. Cautious investors may feel hesitant about investing in a stock that has come this far, but the fact is this elite company is still outperforming.Bottom LineSolid institutional buying should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. With a robust earnings history and an improving future outlook, INSW represents a great opportunity. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is a compelling investment with strong price momentum.Healthy fundamentals combined with a strong technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. Backed by a leading industry group and a lengthy history of earnings beats, it's not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. If you're looking for a way to diversify your portfolio, make sure to put INSW on your shortlist.Bear of the Day:Whirlpool Corporation manufactures and markets home appliances and related products globally. The company's principal products include refrigerators, freezers, ice makers, water filters, laundry appliances, and dishwasher appliances. WHR distributes its products under well-known brands such as Maytag, KitchenAid, Whirlpool, Everydrop, and Royalstar brands. The company sells its products to retailers, distributors, dealers, builders, and directly to consumers.The Zacks RundownWHR has been severely underperforming the market over the past year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, WHR experienced a climax top in May of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The stock is hitting a series of 52-week lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market continues its volatile start to the year.Whirlpool is part of the Zacks Household Appliances industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 9% out of approximately 250 industries. Because this industry is ranked in the bottom half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. The industry has fallen nearly 49% this year, widely underperforming the market.While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in poor-performing industries, their industry association serves as a headwind for any potential rallies. Also note the unfavorable characteristics for this group below:Weak Foundation: Falling Short on Earnings and Deteriorating ForecastsEarnings misses have been a sore spot for WHR lately. The household appliances company most recently reported Q3 earnings results last week of $4.49/share, a -19.68% miss versus the $5.59 consensus estimate. Revenues of $4.78 billion also missed the mark by -8.62%, and WHR has missed on revenue projections for the last five quarters. Consistently missing expectations by a wide margin is a recipe for stock price underperformance.Analysts have revised Q4 earnings estimates down by -8.81% in the past week. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $5.38/share, reflecting negative growth of -12.38% relative to the same quarter last year. Revenues are seen slipping -6.98% to $5.41 billion. These are the types of negative trends that the bears like to see.Technical OutlookWHR stock has been steadily falling since last year and has now established a well-defined downtrend. Shares have declined nearly 40% in the past year, and the stock continues to trade below both moving averages.While not the most accurate indicator, WHR has also experienced what is known as a 'death cross,' wherein the stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. WHR would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock is making a series of lower lows – another good sign for the bears.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop shows that this stock doesn't deserve a spot in the household portfolio. The fact that WHR is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. Falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend.WHR is rated a 'C' in our Zacks Style Score Growth category, indicating more weakness ahead. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy.Additional content:What to Expect from Aerospace Q3 Earnings?The third-quarter 2022 earnings cycle has started for aerospace and defense stocks, with Lockheed Martin reporting better-than-expected earnings. Some major industry players like Boeing, General Dynamics and Teledyne Technologies are set to reveal their Q3 numbers tomorrow.Factors that Influenced Aerospace &amp; Defense StocksGrowing global air travel demand, driven by a steady recovery in the domestic space as well as improving trends observed in international air travel, is expected to significantly boost the Q3 results of aerospace and defense stocks, particularly those engaged in commercial aviation. Evidently, Boeing witnessed a solid year-over-year surge of 31.8% in its commercial shipments during the third quarter.With Boeing the largest jet maker in the nation, we expect the Q3 results of the remaining aerospace majors to reflect a similar improvement in delivery trends. Such solid deliveries must have boosted the overall top-line growth of the Aerospace sector, which houses all aerospace and defense stocks.Stocks in this industry that are more focused on combat must have gained as a result of steady government support. Moreover, a steady order flow observed in the past couple of quarters, along with improving delivery trends in recent times, buoyed by recovering economic trends are projected to have bolstered Q3 revenues of aerospace and defense stocks.However, persistent headwinds like supply chain disruption along with some unfavorable project timing as the result of coronavirus might have an adverse impact on the Q3 bottom line of the industry.Q3 ProjectionsAerospace sector Q3 earnings are expected to slip 0.7% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure, while revenues are projected to improve 8.2%. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through the latest Earnings Preview.Aerospace &amp; Defense Stocks to WatchLet's take a look at three defense companies that are scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 26 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcements.Boeing's third-quarter deliveries reflected a solid 31.8% surge in commercial shipments from the year-ago reported figure, while defense deliveries declined 2.7%. Such mixed delivery numbers from manufacturing companies like Boeing are likely to contribute moderately to the jet maker's overall third-quarter results.Strong cargo markets with several Boeing-converted freighter and materials management agreements must have added an impetus to the company's Q3 revenues. However, the discontinuation of an engine distribution agreement since the second quarter might have impacted BA's government service revenue profile, thereby partly hampering its overall performance in Q3 (read more: Rise in Aftermarket Service to Aid Boeing in Q3 Earnings?).According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boeing currently has an Earnings ESP of -1,900% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.General Dynamics' Q3 results are expected to reflect the solid performance of most of its segments. While increased air travel demand is projected to have boosted Aerospace unit's performance, increased demand volume for shipbuilding is expected to have benefited the Marine Systems segment. Increased revenues from U.S. Stryker wheeled combat vehicles are anticipated to have benefited the Combat Systems unit, while strong order activity might have boosted the performance of the Technologies segment.However, the shortage of chips may have continued to plague the company's ability to deliver certain products in the third quarter as well, thereby partly impacting overall results.General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of -0.41% and a Zacks Rank #3 (read more: Will Segment Sales Aid General Dynamics Q3 Earnings?).Teledyne's Q3 results are likely to reflect solid segmental performance from the majority of its business units. While higher sales of electronic tests and measurement instrumentation, marine instrumentation and environmental instrumentation are projected to have boosted the top line of the Instrumentation segment, the FLIR acquisition along with strong sales growth of the industrial and scientific sensors, cameras and X-ray products must have bolstered the Digital Imaging unit's revenues. Also, higher sales of energy systems amid lower sales of engineered products must have benefited Engineered Systems' performance.Nevertheless, the dual impact of inflation as well as supply-chain constraints might have adversely impacted TDY's soon-to-be-reported quarterly earnings.Teledyne currently has an Earnings ESP of -1.20% and a Zacks Rank #3 (read more: Will Strong Sales Momentum Boost Teledyne's Q3 Earnings?)Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

In the third quarter the company's Mission Systems unit faced pressure from supply chain disruptions, inflation and labor disruptions.The company also disclosed an order for its munitions business related to the war in Ukraine.Net earnings in the quarter ended Oct. 2 were $902 million or $3.26 per share, compared with $860 million or $3.07 per share a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected net earnings of $3.15 per share, based on Refinitiv data.Sales at the Marine Systems unit, which manufactures nuclear-powered submarines, rose by 5% to $2.77 billion from $2.64 billion a year earlier, while overall revenue grew 4.3% to $9.98 billion.The aerospace unit's sales increased by 13.6% to $2.35 billion from $2.07 billion a year earlier.(Reporting by Nathan Gomes in Bengaluru and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Milla Nissi and David Holmes)]"

But the major reduction of Russian gas supplies this year has made the them extremely volatile, and more expensive than LNG prices in other regions.The EU Commission has said an alternative LNG price benchmark – which market participants could use voluntarily – should be based on verifiable price assessments for LNG cargo deliveries, to ensure it reflected real-world prices for the fuel.The Commission has already initiated work on a new benchmark with the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).""Reflecting the energy situation which exists within Europe today, customers need a futures contract to price LNG imports into Europe and provide a means to manage the difference with the price of natural gas delivered via pipeline,"" said Gordon Bennett, managing director of utility markets at ICE.""ICE is ready to assist with developing an EU futures market based on the complementary LNG benchmark to be developed by ACER,"" he added.ICE said the contracts will be cash-settled based on Spark Commodities’ price assessments for LNG cargos and priced in U.S. dollars per million British thermal units in line with ICE’s existing LNG contracts.It also plans to launch three supporting natural gas first line contracts for the French gas hub PEG, the German hub THE and Italian PSV hub. All the new contracts are due to be launched on Dec. 5, subject to regulatory approval.(Reporting by Nina Chestney Editing by Bernadette Baum)]"

If one single idling vessel discharges its cargo, the price will immediately collapse by affecting the other cargoes on the queue and this domino effect is so painful in terms of opportunity cost,"" one of the sources said.European natural gas prices are at their lowest since June, dropping 28% in a week, partly due to high inventory levels and above-normal temperatures, according to Rystad Energy.""For those floating storage cargoes sold on a DES (delivery ex ship) basis, we’re expecting most of these to be delivered in early November, though some firms may push deliveries yet further into winter,""said Samuel Good, head of LNG pricing at commodity pricing agency Argus.Out of nine vessels anchored off Cadiz by Wednesday noon, three belong to Spain's Naturgy: Castillo De Caldelas, Rioja Knutsen and Iberia Knutsen, two industry sources said.Story continuesOne of the other ships belongs to BP, three to commodity trader Trafigura and one to U.S. Cheniere and the last one is empty, the sources said, adding that vessels are sometimes subleased by other companies.A Naturgy spokesperson said that its ships have assigned discharge slots in Spain and are waiting for those dates to unload.BP, Cheniere and Trafigura declined to comment on regular cargo operations.Spanish port authorities said that some ships had been waiting since mid-September.One industry player said there were no problems with the slots allocated in September in Spain.""Currently, prices are declining pretty fast and paradoxically, these cargoes will seize less value than in September or early October,"" he said.Toby Copson, global head of trading and advisory at Trident LNG said cargoes were unlikely to be redirected to Asia, given soaring freight costs and as prices are lower than in Europe. European LNG cargo prices for December remain competitive versus Asia for U.S. origin LNG.Prices between November and December remain in contango, where the futures price of a commodity is higher than spot levels.Meanwhile, some tankers that had been waiting in the Mediterranean since September recently moved, heading to Northwest Europe and UK terminals, data intelligence firm ICIS said.While some spare slots are available at Britain's Isle of Grain and Dragon in late October and early November, daily gas prices at onshore hubs will be under bearish pressure as terminal tanks clear space to tackle the LNG backlog, said Alex Froley, LNG analyst at ICIS.""However, gas prices remain much higher than in first half 2021 and prices for winter next year aren’t falling back as much as the month-ahead,"" he added.(Reporting Marwa Rashad and Belén Carreño; Additional reporting by Julia Payne and Jesús Aguado; Editing by Veronica Brown and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system"", Birol added.Short-term gaps created by the reduction in fossil fuel supplies from Russia will need to be plugged from elsewhere.The strongest candidates are projects with ""short lead times"" which rapidly bring oil and gas supplies to market without locking in dependency.Global clean energy investment is set to rise to more than $2 trillion a year by 2030, up by half from current levels, while ""international energy markets undergo a profound reorientation in the 2020s as countries adjust to the rupture of Russia-Europe (energy) flows, the IEA said.The IEA last year stunned the energy industry by saying lower demand and a rise in low emissions fuels made new oil and gas fields beyond 2021 unnecessary in its most climate-friendly Net Zero Emissions scenario.PEAKSOn Russia, the IEA said the country, which is the world's largest fossil fuel exporter, will never regain the share of the global energy supply mix it had before its invasion of Ukraine.Story continuesRussia's supply of internationally traded energy will fall to 13% by 2030 from about 20% in 2021, the IEA projects.The IEA also said global demand for every type of fossil fuel is set for a peak or plateau for the first time in the agency's history of modelling.Global emissions of fossil fuels leading to climate change will peak by 2025, as coal use falls within the next several years, natural gas demand plateaus by 2030, and oil demand levels off in the middle of the next decade before falling.""One of the effects of Russia’s actions is that the era of rapid growth in natural gas demand draws to a close,"" the IEA said, pointing to a rise in global demand for gas of less than 5% between last year and 2030.(Reporting By Noah Browning.

(NYSE:NRG) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in three days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase NRG Energy's shares before the 31st of October in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 15th of November.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.35 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.40 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, NRG Energy stock has a trailing yield of around 3.2% on the current share price of $43.15. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for NRG Energy Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. NRG Energy is paying out just 9.7% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 11% of its cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see NRG Energy's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 51% per annum for the past five years. NRG Energy looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. NRG Energy has delivered an average of 15% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpShould investors buy NRG Energy for the upcoming dividend? NRG Energy has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.In light of that, while NRG Energy has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for NRG Energy (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

This compares to earnings of $0.99 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -8.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of Behr paint, Delta faucets and other building products would post earnings of $1.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.14, delivering a surprise of -4.20%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Masco , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $2.2 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.65%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.2 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Masco shares have lost about 31.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for Masco?While Masco has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Masco: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock.

Recently, BK broke out above the 50-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.The 50-day simple moving average, which is one of three major moving averages, is widely used by traders and analysts to establish support and resistance levels for a range of securities. Because it's the first sign of an up or down trend, the 50-day is considered to be more important.Over the past four weeks, BK has gained 6.8%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.Once investors consider BK's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 2 higher, and the consensus estimate has increased as well.Investors should think about putting BK on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Continued execution drove growth across most of the Company's six divisions, while Ratings transaction revenue continues to be negatively impacted by a sharp year-over-year reduction in debt issuance. GAAP net income decreased 24% to $608 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 44% to $1.84 primarily due to the increase in shares outstanding as a result of the merger with IHS Markit. The Company plans to present strategic vision and multi-year targets at its previously announced Investor Day on December 1, 2022 in New York City. The event will be in-person by invitation, and webcast publicly.Story continues""Our teams continue to serve the markets well and rally together in an uncertain external environment,"" said Douglas L. Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer of S&amp;P Global. ""We have seen strong commercial success in multiple areas of the business and are on track with our merger integration program. We are actively monitoring the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape to plan for multiple potential scenarios, while identifying the most promising areas for future growth.""Adjusted revenue decreased 8% compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted revenue from the third quarter of 2021, or 6% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted net income declined 11% to $968 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 4% to $2.93 compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share primarily due to a 7% decrease in pro forma fully diluted shares outstanding. Currency positively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.03. The largest non-core adjustments to earnings in the third quarter of 2022 were for lease impairments and integration costs.Important note on the presentation of financial results and guidance: GAAP financials and guidance are presented to reflect the close of the merger with IHS Markit, and the inclusion of its financial results, as of March 1, 2022. Adjusted financial information, including adjustments to pro forma GAAP financial information and guidance are presented on a pro forma basis as if the merger had closed on January 1, 2021, to facilitate year-over-year comparisons. Non-GAAP pro forma adjusted financials also exclude the contribution of divested businesses from all presented periods.Profit Margin: The Company's reported operating profit margin decreased 2,210 basis points to 29.8% due to the inclusion of IHS Markit and costs associated with the merger. Adjusted operating profit margin decreased 200 basis points to 46.0% compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit margin primarily due to a decline in Ratings transaction revenue, as well as increases in technology and compensation expense. Margin impact was partially offset by lower incentive expenses and cost synergies.Return of Capital: In 2022, through the third quarter, the Company returned more than $11.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of $11 billion in the form of an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement and $749 million in cash dividends. Year-to-date, the Company has completed 92% of its previously announced $12 billion ASR program, which the Company still expects to be completed by the end of the year. The remaining $1 billion of the ASR is expected to launch in December.Market Intelligence: Reported revenue increased 83% to $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2022 driven primarily by the inclusion of IHS Markit revenue and increased 1% compared to pro forma revenue. Adjusted revenue increased 4% to $1.02 billion compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted revenue with growth across categories, led by strong growth in Credit &amp; Risk Solutions as well as Data &amp; Advisory Solutions. Reported operating profit decreased to $174 million from the prior year and by $35 million on a pro forma basis with operating profit margin decreasing 1,530 basis points to 17.1% due to the inclusion of IHS Markit. Adjusted operating profit increased 13% to $345 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.9% compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit margin driven by revenue growth and the realization of merger-related cost synergies, partially offset by increases in compensation expense and cloud spend.Ratings: Reported revenue decreased 33% to $681 million in the third quarter of 2022. Transaction revenue decreased 56% to $244 million. Transaction revenue was negatively impacted by a year-over-year decrease in debt issuance across all categories. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% to $437 million due primarily to lower initial Issuer Credit Rating (ICR) revenue, Rating Evaluation Services (RES) revenue, and unfavorable FX, partially offset by growth at CRISIL. Excluding FX, non-transaction revenue would have decreased 2% year-over-year.Reported operating profit decreased 41% to $377 million from prior year and decreased 41% compared to pro forma operating profit. Operating profit margin decreased 800 basis points to 55.3% compared to the third quarter of 2021 due to the decrease in transaction revenue, partially offset by year-over-year declines in incentive compensation expense. Adjusted operating profit decreased 41% to $381 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating profit margin decreased 750 basis points to 55.9% compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit margin.Commodity Insights: Reported revenue increased 70% to $432 million compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the inclusion of IHS Markit, and increased 5% compared to pro forma revenue driven by Price Assessments, and strong growth in Energy &amp; Resources Data &amp; Insights, offset by slight declines in Upstream Data &amp; Insights and Advisory &amp; Transaction Services. Adjusted revenue increased 5% to $432 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted revenue, driven by the same factors. Reported operating profit increased 4% to $141 million compared to the prior year and increased 1% to $141 million compared to pro forma operating profit while operating profit margin decreased 2,090 basis points to 32.6% compared to the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of IHS Markit. Adjusted operating profit increased 9% to $198 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 45.8% compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit margin. The impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict continues to be the most significant headwind to revenue and profit margins.Mobility: Reported revenue was $346 million in the third quarter of 2022 and increased 12% compared to pro forma revenue. Adjusted revenue increased 8% to $346 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted revenue with growth driven by continued high retention rates and new business in CARFAX, as well as strength in our Planning Solutions and Financials offerings, partially offset by sales and marketing products. Reported operating profit in the third quarter was $90 million and operating profit margin was 25.9%, and increased 88% compared to pro forma operating profit. Adjusted operating profit increased 14% to $146 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 42.4% compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit margin. Revenue growth combined with management actions and favorable FX to drive margin expansion, partially offset by software and cloud expense growth.S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC is a majority-owned subsidiary. The consolidated results are included in S&amp;P Global's income statement and the portion related to the 27% non-controlling interest is removed in net income attributable to non-controlling interests.Reported revenue increased 12% to $334 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to the inclusion of IHS Markit and increased 3% compared to pro forma revenue. Adjusted revenue increased 3% to $334 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted revenue, driven by strong growth in exchange-traded derivatives, and Data &amp; Custom Subscriptions, with growth partially offset by declines in asset-linked fees due to market valuations.Reported operating profit increased 12% to $239 million and increased 10% compared to pro forma operating profit. Operating profit margin increased 20 basis points to 71.5%. Adjusted operating profit increased 5% to $234 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating profit margin improved 100 basis points to 70.3% compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit margin, driven by strong revenue growth, while adjusted expenses were held flat relative to the year-ago period. Operating profit attributable to the Company increased 13% to $175 million. Adjusted pro forma operating profit attributable to the Company increased 11% to $184 million.Engineering Solutions: Reported revenue was $95 million in the third quarter of 2022 and decreased 6% compared to pro forma revenue in the year-ago period. Adjusted revenue decreased 8% to $95 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted revenue, with declines driven primarily by the absence of a Boiler Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) release in 2022, as the most recent edition was released in 3Q21. Reported operating profit in the third quarter was $1 million and operating profit margin was 0.9%. Adjusted operating profit decreased 12% to $17 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 17.9% compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit margin, with expense declines driven by lower BPVC-related royalties, partially offset by increased royalties on other products and product development investment.Corporate Unallocated Expense: Reported Corporate Unallocated Expense of $175 million compares to $89 million of reported Corporate Unallocated Expense in the prior period, and $127 million of pro forma Corporate Unallocated Expense. Adjusted Corporate Unallocated Expense was $24 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted unallocated expense of $36 million in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted pro forma Corporate Unallocated Expense declined from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive costs.Provision for Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate (excluding taxes in relation to earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries) decreased to 17.6% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 19.9% in the same period last year due to a post-merger change in the mix of income by jurisdiction. The adjusted effective tax rate (excluding taxes in relation to earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries) increased to 20.5% compared to 19.9% in the same period last year, as the third quarter 2021 rate included a non-recurring benefit of prior period adjustments. The Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of discrete tax adjustments.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow: Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at the end of the third quarter were $1.4 billion. In the first nine months of 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $1,490 million, cash provided by investing activities was $3,689 million, and cash used for financing activities was $10,128 million. Free cash flow in the first nine months of 2022 was $1,232 million, a decrease of $1,222 million compared to the same period in 2021 and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items was $2,590 million.Outlook: The Company is updating both GAAP and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted guidance for 2022 to reflect the results of the third quarter, as well as our most recent views on the macro-economic and geopolitical environment. 2022 reported revenue is expected to increase more than 30%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $9.75 to $9.90.The Company is providing non-GAAP adjusted guidance on a pro forma basis that excludes merger expenses, and amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions. Non-GAAP pro forma adjusted guidance is provided to reflect expected financial results for the full year, as if the merger with IHS Markit (and associated divestitures) had been completed on January 1, 2021. Non-GAAP pro forma adjusted revenue is now expected to decline mid-single digits. Non-GAAP pro forma adjusted diluted EPS is expected in the range of $11.00 to $11.15. Non-GAAP pro forma adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items is expected to be approximately $4 billion.Comparison of Adjusted Information to U.S. GAAP Information: The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). Company financial results are also presented on an as-reported basis, and on a pro forma basis as if the merger had closed on January 1, 2021, for periods including fiscal year 2021, the three months ended September 30, 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021; the pro forma basis agrees to the Company's previously filed unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information presented in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The Company also refers to and presents certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted revenue and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted revenue; adjusted net income and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted net income; adjusted operating profit and margin and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit and margin; adjusted Corporate Unallocated expense and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted Corporate Unallocated expense; non-GAAP pro forma adjusted other income, net; adjusted interest expense, net and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted interest expense, net; adjusted provision for income taxes and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted provision for income taxes; adjusted effective tax rates and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted effective tax rate; adjusted income before taxes on income and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted income before taxes on income; adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; adjusted diluted EPS, non-GAAP pro forma adjusted diluted EPS and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted diluted EPS guidance; free cash flow and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items; adjusted Indices net operating profit and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted Indices net operating profit; non-GAAP pro forma adjusted revenue guidance; non-GAAP pro forma adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items guidance. The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP on Exhibits 5, 6, 7 and 8. Reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not available due to the challenges and impracticability with estimating some of the items. The Company is not able to provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Because of those challenges, reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that, in the case of non-GAAP financial measures other than free cash flow and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items, enables investors to better compare the Company's performance across periods, and management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its business, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management and that such measures are useful in evaluating the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and repurchase stock. However, investors should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports.Conference Call/Webcast Details: The Company's senior management will review the third quarter 2022 earnings results on a conference call scheduled for today, October 27, at 8:30 a.m. EDT.

However, continued supply-chain disruptions and inflationary pressure remained headwinds.Some major players like Republic Services, Inc. RSG, S&amp;P Global Inc.

As Canada reopened, Tim Hortons’ same-store sales returned to growth during the quarter compared to pre-COVID levels, driven by growth across all dayparts, formats, regions, and product categories aside from hot beverages. The company is focused on executing the next phase of its “Back to Basics” plan by extending its beverage platform, capturing a greater share of afternoon foods, and continuing its brand modernization. Longer-term, management believes it can sustainably grow same-store sales at a low-single-digit rate.At Burger King in the U.S., the company also reported improved results and narrowed the gap to its peers.

Jeremy Siegel expects the Fed to turn dovish, after raising rates by 75 basis points again,  at the FOMC meeting in November. Though the Fed is expected to raise rates, according to Mr. Siegel, the institution will hint at a pivot and ""acknowledge that there has been a tremendous amount of progress made on inflation"". Here are some comments from Jeremy Siegel:""I think the market is more than hoping for what exactly it is- a statement by the Fed that they see progress, and at some point can afford to pause and see if that progress really makes it. That's what the market is looking for. What scares the market the most is that the Fed is gonna stay this tight through 2023, which I absolutely think would be really disastrous.""According to Mr. Siegel, ""tremendous progress has already been made against inflation and we're way on the downside"".  Mr. Siegel said that he ""wouldn't be surprised to see a 2% Federal funds rate by the end of 2023"". While there is still a risk of the Fed continuing its aggressive rate hike schedule and significantly slowing down the economy, Wharton's Jeremy Siegel thinks that ""there's a chance that the Fed can save stagflation, and a serious recession, if they acknowledge now that progress has been made"" as ""inflation is coming down"".While the current stock market situation is uncertain and volatile, equity investors can take advantage of the recent share price weakness and rack up shares of some of the best-in-class companies, while they trade at bargain levels.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.Some of the best stocks to buy for long-term gains include Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

We have trimmed and concentrated our software exposure significantly over the last 18 months down to two cloud-native SAAS players, Workday and Salesforce. We met with both businesses during our trip and came away encouraged from language indicating increased focus on profitability and cost control.We see significant optionality in these businesses to grow at the same time as expanding margins and free cash flow. The discussions increased our conviction that returns on capital are now becoming a priority for CEOs and CFOs in this sector who are talking for the first time about cost discipline, reduced capex, more measured hiring practices, a reduction in the level of stock-based compensation and scaled back M&amp;A ambitions.

(NYSE:UBER) is a market leader in the ridesharing industry with a strong competitive advantage. The company has a large and growing customer base, a strong platform, and a growing suite of services.

(NYSE:UBER) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We believe the market is underestimating the competitive position and earnings potential that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has in its core Rides and Eats businesses. Uber holds the #1 position in 90% of its rideshare markets globally and is typically more than twice the size of its next competitor. Having the largest and most dense driver network is a key advantage as it enables Uber to offer shorter pickup times and lower prices than competitors while also earning higher margins. We believe the synergies between Rides and Eats will further improve Uber’s service quality and cost position. In recent years, competition from well-funded but unprofitable challengers has pressured Uber’s economics. However, as these challengers are forced to compete more rationally, we expect Uber to generate significant margin improvement alongside continued high growth. We began buying shares at just over 1x revenue and a double-digit free cash flow yield based on management’s guidance for 2024. We view this as an attractive valuation for a business with Uber’s future growth outlook.”6.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Mastercard The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.9bUS$13.9bUS$15.5bUS$17.8bUS$19.5bUS$21.0bUS$22.2bUS$23.2bUS$24.0bUS$24.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 9.58%Est @ 7.3%Est @ 5.7%Est @ 4.59%Est @ 3.8%Est @ 3.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$11.2kUS$12.2kUS$12.7kUS$13.7kUS$14.1kUS$14.2kUS$14.0kUS$13.7kUS$13.4kUS$12.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$132bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$532bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$532b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$277bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$409b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$311, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mastercard as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.018. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

194,16601fd5-bf23-3b32-b5dc-7bce40d13dac,QCOM,2022-10-27,Qualcomm (QCOM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-qcom-earnings-expected-grow-140102813.html,1666792862,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Qualcomm (QCOM) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.5%.Revenues are expected to be $11.38 billion, up 21.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.32% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Qualcomm?For Qualcomm, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Qualcomm will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Qualcomm would post earnings of $2.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.96, delivering a surprise of +3.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Qualcomm doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company lowered full-year revenue guidance to $107-110M down from $120-126M previously while also lowering FY22 topline guidance to 50% growth from 65% at the time of the PIPE transaction due to continuing supply constraints and labor shortage.”Matterport, Inc.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Expedia is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Booking Holdings has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This means that EXPE's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.EXPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.14, while BKNG has a forward P/E of 20.22. We also note that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 1.01. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. BKNG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.23.Another notable valuation metric for EXPE is its P/B ratio of 4.60. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, BKNG has a P/B of 18.60.These metrics, and several others, help EXPE earn a Value grade of A, while BKNG has been given a Value grade of D.EXPE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than BKNG, so it seems like value investors will conclude that EXPE is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While many of our office spaces are leased, we are researching how we can improve sustainability performance by engaging with building owners and managers on their own commitments to greener operations.Helping us design local solutions, today we have over 600 global employees actively engaged in our sustainability resource group, leading initiatives in their home offices and advising our global sustainability efforts. Though COVID-19 posed a unique challenge, we continue to encourage small changes to everyday actions - such as avoiding single-use plastics - that can add up to a substantial impact.Another particular area of ongoing focus for us is the daily commute. We have annually surveyed all Seattle employees about how they travel to and from work, and going forward we will assess and estimate global commute patterns through the lens of the hybrid work policy now in place. We are committed to supporting lower impact options, such as carpooling or the use of public transit, which Expedia Group subsidizes for employees.In our Seattle headquarters (HQ), we have also set plans to survey existing features and performance, identifying opportunities for even greater efficiency improvements. This includes ensuring waste management practices align with all relevant local regulations and developing processes that reduce water, energy, and material use.Seattle HQ:LEED Gold certification awarded in 2021RECOGNIZED SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCETwo years ago, we opened our Seattle, Washington, campus - an HQ designed with sustainability at the forefront. We transformed the 40-acre waterfront area - part of which was formerly an industrial area - bringing in soil, native plants, and grasses to restore nature and create coastal meadows.Story continuesIn 2021, thanks to our investments in enhanced efficiency, sustainable materials, and emissions and waste reductions, the campus was awarded Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification.Throughout 2021, we updated the site to enhance the value of outdoor spaces and boost local biodiversity. A designated area has been set for an employee vegetable garden while a new onsite apiary provides a welcoming space for bees. We have now applied for SITES certification, a recognition given to organizations that have designed, developed, and maintained sustainable landscapes that protect local ecosystems.CREATING A WAVE OF CHANGE WITH IBEROSTARWith 80% of properties located on the seafront, Iberostar Group is passionate about keeping oceans healthy and full of thriving species.

199,ee3f7b61-c609-3fb9-9be2-b5fb4305442b,EXPE,2022-10-27,Can Expedia (EXPE) Climb 54% to Reach the Level Wall Street Analysts Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expedia-expe-climb-54-reach-135501424.html,1666792501,STORY,['EXPE'],"[Shares of Expedia (EXPE) have gained 7.5% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $98.71, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $152.10 indicates a potential upside of 54.1%.The average comprises 21 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $112 to a high of $275, with a standard deviation of $38.15. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 13.5% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 178.6% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for EXPE, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for EXPEHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why EXPE Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 3.1%.Moreover, EXPE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much EXPE could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:BAX), a global medtech leader, today reported results for the third quarter of 2022.""Baxter’s wide-ranging product portfolio is fundamental to healthcare globally, and at the heart of our sustained success over more than nine decades,"" said José (Joe) E. Almeida, chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""We continue to navigate today’s challenging macroenvironment and have taken decisive action on multiple fronts to mitigate ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, while remaining focused on the needs of all our stakeholders – from patients, clinicians and customers to our employees and shareholders. Our vision for the company and fundamental strengths are intact. We remain confident in our ability to deliver innovation for patients, to realize the potential of the Hillrom acquisition and to continue strategically optimizing our portfolio.""Third-Quarter Financial ResultsWorldwide sales in the third quarter totaled $3.8 billion, increasing 17% on a reported basis, 23% on a constant currency basis and rising slightly on an operational basis. Operational sales in the quarter exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the December 2021 acquisition of Hillrom.Sales in the U.S. totaled $1.8 billion, increasing 40% on a reported basis and declining 1% on an operational basis. International sales of $1.9 billion increased 1% on a reported basis, 12% at constant currency rates and 2% operationally.Story continuesAmong Baxter’s product categories, Renal Care, Clinical Nutrition and Advanced Surgery delivered mid-single-digit growth at constant currency rates. Medication Delivery performance was comparable to the same period in 2021 at constant currency rates. Growth in the quarter was partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Pharmaceuticals, primarily driven by increased generic competition. As expected, Acute Therapies and BioPharma Solutions both declined at constant currency rates, reflecting challenging year-over-year comparisons due to a return to normal sales patterns following increased COVID-19 related sales in the third quarter of 2021.Legacy Hillrom’s Front Line Care, Patient Support Systems and Surgical Solutions businesses contributed $735 million to third-quarter sales on a reported basis. After adjusting for foreign exchange, sales in the quarter declined mid-single digits as compared to the prior year period, reflecting a difficult year-over-year comparison as well as the ongoing impact to business performance from electromechanical supply constraints.Please see the attached schedules accompanying this press release for additional details on sales performance in the quarter, including breakouts by Baxter’s product categories and segments.Baxter’s third quarter 2022 financial statements recognize pre-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $3.1 billion in connection with the December 2021 Hillrom acquisition. These charges primarily reflect changes in macroeconomic factors, such as rising interest rates and broad declines in equity valuations, as well as the impact of current supply chain challenges on earnings forecasts for the legacy Hillrom businesses.For the third quarter, net income (loss) attributable to Baxter was ($2.9 billion), or ($5.83) per diluted share, on a U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis. This includes special items totaling $3.4 billion after tax. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to Baxter totaled $414 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, a 20% decline as compared to the prior year period.Recent HighlightsBaxter continues to advance key healthcare technologies in pursuit of its Mission to Save and Sustain Lives. Among recent highlights, the company:Announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance of its Novum IQ syringe infusion pump (SYR) with Dose IQ Safety Software. Syringe infusion pumps are typically used to precisely deliver small amounts of fluid at low rates, often in pediatric, neonatal or anesthesia care settings. The Novum IQ SYR utilizes intuitive technologies developed to help reduce infusion errors and was designed to meet rigorous FDA guidance for infusion devices, including cybersecurity. Additionally, the Novum IQ SYR has the capability to fully integrate with hospital electronic medical record (EMR) systems through Baxter’s IQ Enterprise Connectivity Suite.Received European Union Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification for the Oxiris blood purification set, used for performing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and hemoperfusion. Now with an updated indication, Oxiris is certified as the only blood purification set currently available to effectively remove inflammatory mediators, endotoxin, fluid and uremic toxins simultaneously.Launched Baxter’s SmartCare Remote Management (SCRM) technology for Centrella and Progressa Smart+ bed models in the U.S. market. SCRM is a cloud-based software solution that offers proactive intelligent equipment management across an entire fleet of connected devices. For smart beds, SCRM allows the healthcare provider to remotely monitor the bed’s location, occupancy, and service needs, including error codes and preventive maintenance schedules, and can also be used to remotely deliver the latest firmware updates.In addition, FDA recently completed its review of Baxter’s pharmaceutical manufacturing site in Ahmedabad, India, and classified the facility as ""voluntary action indicated"" (VAI), meaning the Ahmedabad site is now designated to be in a state of compliance. As a result, FDA is now able to approve new drug product applications and major prior approval supplements referencing the Ahmedabad site.As an integral part of Baxter’s commitment to corporate responsibility, the company continues to prioritize its expansive ACT (Activating Change Today) initiative, a multidisciplinary effort to advance racial justice by driving meaningful, sustainable change within Baxter and the communities and markets the company serves. Among recent ACT milestones, the company has initiated new grants to organizations working to advance racial justice, expanded its support of students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to help further the pipeline of Black healthcare professionals, and announced the national expansion of its partnerships with not-for-profit organizations The Links, Incorporated, and the National Kidney Foundation to bring greater awareness and resources to help address the disproportionate challenges affecting Black Americans related to kidney health.Baxter also continues to be recognized for workplace excellence, having most recently been named by Seramount to its 2022 lists of 100 Best Companies and Best Companies for Dads.2022 Financial OutlookFor full-year 2022: Baxter now expects U.S. GAAP earnings (loss) of ($4.52) to ($4.45) per diluted share and adjusted earnings, before special items, of $3.53 to $3.60 per diluted share. The company expects sales growth of 17% to 18% on a reported basis, approximately 23% on a constant currency basis and low single digits on an operational basis. Baxter's updated full-year financial outlook reflects the continued impact from supply constraints for electromechanical components, foreign exchange pressures as well as increased interest expenses and a higher effective tax rate.For fourth-quarter 2022: The company expects sales growth of mid-to-high single digits on a reported basis, mid-teens on a constant currency basis and approximately flat on an operational basis. The company expects U.S. GAAP earnings of $0.60 to $0.67 per diluted share and adjusted earnings, before special items, of $0.92 to $0.99 per diluted share.Third-Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference CallA webcast of Baxter’s third-quarter 2022 conference call for investors can be accessed live from a link at the company’s website at www.baxter.com beginning at 7:30 a.m. CDT on October 27, 2022.

Special items are excluded because they are highly variable or unusual, and of a size that may substantially affect the company’s reported operations for a period. Certain of those items represent estimates based on information reasonably available at the time of the press release. Future events or new information may result in different actual results.Net sales growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis. These measures provide information on the percentage change in net sales growth assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and current periods. Net sales growth rates are also presented on an operational basis. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, operational sales growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the December 2021 acquisition of Hillrom. This measure provides information on the change in net sales growth rates assuming that foreign exchange rates remained constant and excluding the impact of the company’s recent acquisition of Hillrom.For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, special items include intangible asset amortization, business optimization charges, integration expenses, expenses related to European medical devices regulation, a pension curtailment gain, investigation and related costs, product-related items, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, a loss on a product divestiture arrangement, a reclassification of a cumulative translation loss to earnings and a tax matter. These items are excluded because they are highly variable or unusual and of a size that may substantially impact the company’s reported operations for a period. Additionally, intangible asset amortization is excluded as a special item to facilitate an evaluation of current and past operating performance and is consistent with how management and the company’s Board of Directors assess performance.Non-GAAP financial measures may enhance an understanding of the company’s operations and may facilitate an analysis of those operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations to corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, may enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the company’s past financial performance and prospects for the future.

Earnings have also increased year over year, albeit, at a slower pace than revenues. Inflationary headwinds, supply chain challenges and labor shortages however continued for the sector, hurting the bottom line amid recovering demand for medical products and services. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 8.9% of the companies in the Medical sector, comprising 29.8% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Oct 19. Of these, 80% beat earnings estimates while all of them surpassed revenue estimates. Earnings increased 3.8% year over year on 8.9% higher revenues.This scorecard highlights the Medical sector’s continued resilience amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Throughout the third quarter, most players in the industry were reeling under the greater-than-anticipated surge in inflationary pressure across the world. Mounting raw material costs, labor-supply constraints and supply-chain disruptions hampered the entire production and distribution process. Despite the challenging situation, the consistent opening up of economies, with countries lifting COVID-19 restrictions, might have favored the growth process in Q3.Overall, third-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 7.6%, while sales are expected to increase 3.8%. This compares with the second-quarter reported earnings growth of 6.5% and revenue growth of 9.9%.Medical Device Quarterly SynopsysIntegral to the broader Medical sector, the Medical Device companies’ collective business growth is likely to have recorded an improvement compared with the last year, with a significant reduction in COVID-led fatality across the United States and other developed countries. Added to this, notable Medical Device players have been undertaking consistent efforts to mitigate staffing shortages that have disrupted business growth since the pandemic’s beginning. These factors are likely to have been advantageous for the base businesses of the Medical Device stocks.Story continuesYet, Medical Device companies continue to be burdened by the global shortage of semiconductors chips that produce life-saving medical equipment like pacemakers, blood-pressure monitors, insulin pumps and defibrillators. This ongoing challenge is expected to have significantly hampered performance across several businesses in the Medical Device industry in Q3.Overall, the rebound in the base business through the months of the third quarter is expected to have been impressive. Medical Device companies like Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings LH or LabCorp, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. BIO, Baxter International BAX, DexCom DXCM and West Pharmaceutical Services WST are likely to have been positively influenced by the abovementioned factors in Q3, despite continuing challenges in the macroeconomic front.Let’s take a look at the Medical Device players scheduled to announce results on Oct 27.LabCorp: LabCorp has been registering an ongoing sales rebound in the base business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development segments. However, as the severity of the pandemic has declined, we expect the demand for COVID-19 testing services and vaccines to have been lower than the year-ago period, impacting the third-quarter sales performance. Added to this, the ongoing inflationary pressure, a strengthening U.S. dollar and supply chain issues are expected to have adversely impacted LabCorp’s third-quarter performance (Read more: LabCorp to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates.LH has an Earnings ESP of -1.41% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

We expect this growth momentum to have continued in the third quarter on the back of sustained sales gains in the company’s Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Droplet Digital PCR (dPCR), Process Media businesses and Western Blot. The company has also been witnessing strong growth in the biopharma market for the Droplet Digital PCR platform, which is expected to have made significant contributions to the third-quarter top line. However, due to the Russia-Ukraine war situation, supply chain constraints are likely to have impacted instrument placements.

The company’s robust product portfolio and the planned launch of therapies and products are expected to have impacted the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues. However, the sales growth of the BioPharma Solutions segment is likely to have been hurt by challenging year-over-year comparisons, resulting from prior-year COVID-related sales.

QuoteDexCom: DexCom’s third-quarter 2022 top line is likely to have been impacted by an increase in volume, courtesy of new patients across all channels and rising global awareness regarding the benefits of its real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (“CGM”).DexCom launched the Dexcom ONE product in the United Kingdom and Spain during the second quarter. These developments are likely to have benefited customer growth during the soon-to-be-quarter. In March, the company’s received the FDA’s Breakthrough Device Designation for the Dexcom CGM system’s use in the hospital setting. DexCom has been benefiting from demographic trends and lifestyles in countries outside the United States and Europe. Per the company, international growth remains strong and presents lucrative opportunities, courtesy of improving global access and awareness.

QuoteWest Pharmaceutical Services: West Pharmaceutical’s Proprietary Products business continues to exhibit sustained strength and has been an important contributor to the company’s top-line growth. In the first half of 2022, sales improved significantly on the back of double-digit growth in high-value products (HVP). The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter. Apart from this, the company is likely to have witnessed margin expansion in the aforementioned segment in the to-be-reported quarter, owing to a favorable mix of products sold (stemming from the demand in HVP), production efficiencies and higher sales price. However, the company’s business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which is likely to have adversely impacted the company’s third-quarter performance.

DJIA is down 13.13% year-to-date, but this decline is comparatively less severe than the 19.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of October 24. Some of the most prominent Dow stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The Dow has maintained its individuality by being the price-weighted index in the US stock market. Though the index tracks the performance of just 30 companies, investing in the Dow provides exposure to some of the best names in the market, providing value to beginner investors. Moreover, these industry-leading companies are also favored because of their dividends and yields. Over the years, the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA have shown a strong correlation, however, their performances have branched off in the past. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, the Dow has slightly outperformed the broader market in the last 30 years ending June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, while DJIA returned 11.16%.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:Nearly all companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are dividend players.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as NIKE (NYSE:NKE), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8. Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

207,45dec530-4d46-3eb7-9b59-10477237faa1,JNJ,2022-10-27,Will AbbVie's Immunology Drugs Continue to Drive Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbvies-immunology-drugs-continue-drive-164604489.html,1666802764,STORY,"['ABBV', 'ADCT', 'JNJ']","[AbbVie’s ABBV third-quarter revenues are likely to be driven by revenues generated from the sales of its immunology and aesthetic products. The company generates more than half of its revenues from these two portfolios.A major portion of the company’s revenues is generated from its immunology franchise, consisting of three blockbuster drugs — Humira, Rinvoq and Skyrizi. Humira is AbbVie’s flagship product and accounts for more than one-third of the company’s total revenues. We expect the company’s flagship drug Humira to register strong growth in the United States, which is more than likely to offset the downward trend in the drug’s international sales due to generic erosion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. sales of Humira is pegged at $4.93 billion, while that for international sales is $615 million. Our model estimates Humira U.S. sales to stand at $4.98 billion, while ex-U.S. sales are expected at around $649 million.AbbVie’s stock has gained 10.7% in the year compared with an increase of 0.1% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe robust sequential revenue growth for new immunology drugs — Skyrizi and Rinvoq — is likely to have continued in the third quarter of 2022. The rise in sales is likely due to label expansions of both drugs to include new patient populations in the last few quarters. During the third quarter, Rinvoq received label expansions in European Union in ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis indications.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rinvoq and Skyrizi sales in the third quarter is pegged at $726 million and $1.26 billion, respectively. Our model estimates Rinvoq and Skyrizi sales to be pegged at $738 million and $1.06 billion, respectively.In the aesthetics franchise, we expect Botox sales to rise due to increased product demand, while Juvederm sales are projected to register a lower sales growth. The company’s suspension of its aesthetics business operations in Russia, which is a key market for fillers, is likely responsible for this lower international Juvederm sales growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for aesthetic products are pegged at $1.42 billion and $1.46 billion.Story continuesU.S. sales growth of key oncology medicine, Imbruvica — developed in partnership with J&amp;J JNJ — is hurt by increased competition from novel oral therapies.

If you want to see more of the best global dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Given several decades of rising globalization, many leading American companies do business around the world. Leading companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) sell Windows in the United States, Europe, and China, for example.The leading companies have gone global to try to increase their market sizes. With larger market sizes, companies have more potential consumers, and more potential revenue opportunities. With more potential revenue, there's potential for more profits.Helping with this process is that many markets enjoy close ties with the United States. Major countries in Europe, for example, have been allies with the United States for many decades. Even countries like China have had strong relations with the United States such that trade between the two country amounted to almost $560 billion in total two way trade in 2020. The close ties makes doing business easier and helps facilitate the flow of capital.Another reason for many American companies doing business globally is the U.S. dollar. Given the U.S dollar is the dominant global reserve currency, many emerging countries want it to develop and the U.S. dollar generally goes further in terms of purchasing power as a result in the emerging countries. As a result, leading U.S. companies that expand in emerging markets can often do it more cheaply because the U.S. dollar has more purchasing power.Lastly, many leading U.S. companies go global because there is often less competition in emerging markets than in the U.S. market. With less competition, it's easier to gain market share and to make profits.2022 has been a challenging year in the markets given the higher inflation, the interest rate hikes by the Fed, and the Ukraine Russian war. As a result of the headwinds, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 19.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has fallen 29.3% year to date.Story continuesGiven the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the dividend sector, here are 10 stocks that are global in terms of their operations and that also have an attractive dividend to consider.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now, we took 10 stocks with substantial earnings power that had global operations and also paid a dividend. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders in our database that held shares of the same stocks at the end of Q2 2022.10 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 3.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a pretty global company. According to Statista, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)'s U.S. sales were $29.75 billion in 2021 while its Developed Europe sales were $18.3 billion, its Developed Rest of World sales were $12.5 billion and its Emerging Markets sales were $20.7 billion for the same year.Given the company's dividend yield of 3.51% as of 10/25, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also a dividend stock as well. If Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) exceeds expectations in terms of innovation, both the world and stock holders could benefit.Alongside Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also a global dividend stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the second quarter.9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 1.12%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is also pretty global given it sells its pharmaceuticals in the U.S., EU, Japan, China, and elsewhere.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has also been a pretty strong performer in terms of its stock. While the broader market has declined substantially in 2022, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stock has risen over 27% year to date. Shares are near an all time high as analysts expect Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) earnings per share to grow substantially in the future. If EPS grows, the company's dividend could grow too. As of 10/25, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have a dividend yield of 1.12%.Baron Funds commented on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment is in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 2.79%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Given it has operations in more than 180 countries, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a global company. Although the strong U.S. dollar isn't good for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)'s near term international earnings, the company still has substantial earnings power. Given its 66 consecutive years of annual dividend increases and its dividend yield of 2.79% as of 10/25, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is also still a dividend stock.On 10/20, Lauren Lieberman of Barclays raised her price target on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) to $145 from $139 and kept an 'Overweight' rating citing that the company's fiscal first quarter results were better than expected and that management commentary has helped sentiment.7. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 72Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1.33%With North America accounting for around 41% of the company's total sales, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an international company. Lately, the company has faced some headwinds due to industry specific challenges as well as macro headwinds, however. Ensemble Capital explained NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s recent headwinds in a Q3 2022 letter,“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) (-18.4%): The company spent most of the quarter trading about in line with the overall market. But on the last day of the quarter, they reported earnings that demonstrated strong consumer demand, but a series of geographic and product level inventory level issues. Given the start-stop nature of their production during COVID, strained global supply chains, and China consumers popping in and out of lockdowns, the company ended up with too much apparel inventory and announced they’d be slashing prices on certain items to reset inventory to appropriate levels quickly.”While NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has headwinds, the stock nevertheless has potential earnings growth potential in the future given the increasing global population and rising global wealth.As of 10/25, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares have a dividend yield of 1.33% and a payout ratio of 33.2%. With the relatively low payout ratio, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) could raise its dividend in the future without its earnings increasing very much.6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 2.65%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global company given it has operations in over 175 countries.Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a dividend aristocrat given it has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years. As a result of the dividend increases, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares currently yield 2.65%. Like its dividend, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s earnings per share has trended higher with occasional dips in the long term.In terms of its EPS, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) had a relatively strong Q3 given adjusted EPS of $2.55 versus the consensus of $2.48. Sales for the period were $23.8 billion versus the consensus of $23.34 billion. For FY22, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) expects adjusted operation EPS of $10.70-$10.75 and sales of $93 billion to $93.5 billion.Like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc.

Currently, the company’s earnings are depressed due to semiconductor supply constraints that are impacting the entire industry. We expect these constraints to prove transitory, and we’re confident that component shortages will be resolved in the coming years. Furthermore, we believe that OEMs are likely to rely heavily on third-party suppliers, like BorgWarner, to leverage R&amp;D expenses to enhance innovation and speed-to-market in an electrified world. For decades, we’ve been impressed with how BorgWarner management has successfully acquired and scaled fuel efficiency technologies for internal combustion engines. We see strong parallels and underappreciated potential in the acquisitions the company has made over the past 5+ years in key electric vehicle technologies. We believe the company is well-positioned to manufacture and integrate new propulsion systems and components to meet customer demands.”BorgWarner Inc.

To learn more, or input a submission, please visit Medtronic Neurovascular Co-Lab™ Platform at www.medtronic.com/neurovascular-co-lab.About the stroke challengeAdvancing stroke care is critical and urgent. Globally, 15 million people suffer from stroke annually. Of those, 5 million people die and another 5 million are left permanently disabled.1 Yet, the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability globally often goes untreated. 2 Most people experience ischemic strokes in which blood flow to the brain is blocked by a clot. Studies indicate that only about 10 to 14 percent receive clot-dissolving treatment that can stop the onset of stroke symptoms.3  Furthermore, the use of mechanical thrombectomy, a surgical treatment for stroke and the standard of care for large vessel occlusion strokes remains extremely low. In the U.S., the 2019 estimate of thrombectomies was below 40,000, while the number of patients who could benefit from thrombectomy was between 200,000 and 350,000.4About the Neurovascular business at MedtronicWith the largest neurovascular technology business in the world, Medtronic Neurovascular led evidence-based medicine in neurointervention with five landmark studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. Its clinical and regulatory leadership and bold approach shaped the current guidelines for treating strokes.5About MedtronicBold thinking. Bolder actions. We are Medtronic.

However, continued supply-chain disruptions and inflationary pressure remained headwinds.Some major players like Republic Services, Inc. RSG, S&amp;P Global Inc. SPGI and Fiserv, Inc. FISV are set to reveal their Q3 numbers tomorrow.Q3 Tailwinds for Business ServicesWith both manufacturing and service activities in the pink, the demand for consulting services is rising steadily. Both the manufacturing PMI and the Services PMI, measured by the Institute for Supply Management, have stayed above the 50% mark for the past 28 months, indicating continued expansion.The quarter witnessed strength in major manufacturing industries like computer &amp; electronic products; machinery; electrical equipment; appliances &amp; components; transportation equipment; food, beverage &amp; tobacco products; and plastics &amp; rubber products.Among services industries, management of companies &amp; support services; retail trade; wholesale trade; mining; utilities; construction; health care &amp; social assistance; finance &amp; insurance; information; educational services; and professional, scientific &amp; technical services stayed healthy.Earnings Picture So Far and ExpectationsThe third-quarter earnings for the S&amp;P 500 members of the business services sector have been impressive so far. The latest Earnings Outlook suggests that earnings of those S&amp;P 500 members of the business services sector that have reported results grew 16.7% year over year on 14.9% revenue growth, with 66.7% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 66.7% topping sales projections.Story continuesTotal quarterly earnings of the S&amp;P 500 members of the sector are currently anticipated to display 3% year-on-year growth. Revenues will likely reflect an 8.4% rise. This compares unfavorably with 27.6% and 14.3% growth in earnings and revenues in the third quarter of 2021, respectively.RSG, SPGI, FISV in SpotlightHere we discuss three business services companies, scheduled to report their third-quarter 2022 numbers on Oct 27.Our quantitative model suggests that the combination of the following two key ingredients — apositive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — increases the odds of a positive earnings surprise.

(NYSE:MRK) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 75% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 5.5% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 25%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Merck. Check out our latest analysis for Merck ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Merck?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Merck. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Merck's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Merck. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.5% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MerckThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$190m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Merck. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Merck better, we need to consider many other factors.

The trial met its primary efficacy outcome measure, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline at 24 weeks, and eight out of nine secondary efficacy outcome measures, including the outcome measure of proportion of participants achieving multicomponent improvement [defined as improvement in 6MWD, improvement in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, and either improvement in WHO Functional Class (FC) or maintenance of WHO FC II] and the outcome measure of time to death or the first occurrence of a clinical worsening event. The Cognitive/Emotional Impacts domain score of PAH-SYMPACT®, which was assessed as the ninth and final secondary outcome measure, did not achieve statistical significance. Results will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.Merck received a Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MK-2060, an investigational anticoagulant therapy for the reduction in risk of major thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with end-stage renal disease.Oncology program highlightsMerck announced clinical trial results for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 therapy, and Lynparza (olaparib), an oral poly (ADP-ribose) PARP inhibitor being co-developed and co-commercialized with AstraZeneca, at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2022, including:Five-year overall survival (OS) data from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial (KEYTRUDA plus pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin) in patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 trial (KEYTRUDA plus carboplatin-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) in patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.In collaboration with Seagen and Astellas, the first presentation of data from Cohort K of the Phase 1b/2 EV-103/KEYNOTE-869 trial evaluating Padcev (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) in combination with KEYTRUDA as first-line treatment for patients with cisplatin-ineligible unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.Seven-year OS data from the Phase 3 SOLO-1 trial evaluating Lynparza as maintenance treatment in patients with advanced BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, and final OS results from the Phase 3 PAOLA-1 trial evaluating Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who were without evidence of disease after surgery or following response to platinum-based chemotherapy.

Pharmaceutical sales growth in the third quarter was 9% excluding LAGEVRIO sales and 15% excluding LAGEVRIO sales and the impact of foreign exchange, primarily driven by oncology, vaccines and hospital acute care products. The COVID-19 pandemic unfavorably affected sales in the third quarter of 2021 by approximately $350 million, which favorably impacted the growth rate in the third quarter of 2022.Growth in oncology was largely driven by higher sales of KEYTRUDA, which rose 20% to $5.4 billion in the quarter. Global sales growth of KEYTRUDA reflects continued strong momentum from metastatic indications including certain types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and MSI-H cancers, and increased uptake across recent earlier-stage launches including certain types of neoadjuvant/adjuvant TNBC in the U.S.Growth in vaccines was primarily driven by higher combined sales of GARDASIL (Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent [Types 6, 11, 16 and 18] Vaccine, Recombinant) and GARDASIL 9 vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV. Third-quarter GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 sales grew 15% to $2.3 billion, primarily driven by strong demand outside of the U.S., particularly in China, which also benefited from increased supply. Additionally, higher sales in the U.S. reflect public sector buying patterns. Growth in vaccines was partially offset by lower sales of PNEUMOVAX 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent), a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, which declined 53% to $131 million primarily reflecting lower U.S. demand as the market continues to shift toward newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.Growth in hospital acute care reflects higher demand globally for BRIDION (sugammadex) injection 100 mg/mL, a medicine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in adults and pediatric patients ages 2 years and older undergoing surgery. Sales increased 15% to $423 million, primarily due to an increase in its share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. Growth in hospital acute care also reflects higher sales of ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam), a combination cephalosporin antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of adults with certain bacterial infections. Sales of $43 million resulted from the phased resupply initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021, which has been completed in 2022.Pharmaceutical sales growth was partially offset by lower combined sales of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCI), which declined 15% to $1.1 billion, primarily reflecting lower demand and pricing in certain international markets as a result of generic competition, particularly in Europe, and lower demand in the U.S. The company lost market exclusivity for JANUVIA and JANUMET in China in July and in the EU in September, although JANUMET currently continues to have exclusivity in certain European markets.Animal Health revenueAnimal Health sales totaled $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2022, a decline of 3% compared with the third quarter of 2021. Excluding the unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, Animal Health sales grew 4% primarily reflecting higher pricing. Sales of livestock products also reflect higher demand for poultry products. Sales of companion animal products also reflect higher demand for the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) parasiticide line of products, partially offset by supply constraints for certain vaccines.Third-quarter expense informationThe tables below present selected expense information.$ in millionsThird Quarter 2022GAAPAcquisition-andDivestiture-RelatedCosts3RestructuringCosts(Income)Loss fromInvestmentsin EquitySecuritiesNon-GAAP2Cost of sales$3,934$446$54$-$3,434Selling, general and administrative2,5202226-2,472Research and development4,3999021-3,496Restructuring costs94-94--Other (income) expense, net429(26)-350105Third Quarter 2021Cost of sales$3,450$346$48$-$3,056Selling, general and administrative2,336615-2,270Research and development2,445488-2,389Restructuring costs107-107--Other (income) expense, net(450)(10)-(684)244GAAP expense, EPS and related informationGross margin was 73.7% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 73.8% for the third quarter of 2021. The decrease primarily reflects the impacts of higher revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements and sales of LAGEVRIO, both of which have lower gross margins, as well as higher acquisition- and divestiture-related costs. The gross margin decline was largely offset by the favorable effects of product mix and foreign exchange.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 8% compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase primarily reflects higher administrative costs, including compensation and benefit costs, as well as higher promotional spending, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $4.4 billion in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021. The increase primarily reflects $887 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to the ArQule, Inc. acquisition, charges related to collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion and higher clinical development spending.Other (income) expense, net, was $429 million of expense in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $450 million of income in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to net unrealized losses from investments in equity securities in the third quarter of 2022, compared to net unrealized income from investments in equity securities in the third quarter of 2021. Other (income) expense, net, in the third quarter of 2022 also reflects lower pension costs compared to the third quarter of 2021.The effective income tax rate was 9.2% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 13.2% in the third quarter of 2021.GAAP EPS was $1.28 for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $1.80 for the third quarter of 2021.Non-GAAP expense, EPS and related informationNon-GAAP gross margin was 77.0% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 76.8% for the third quarter of 2021. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin primarily reflects the favorable effects of product mix and foreign exchange, largely offset by the impacts of higher revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements and sales of LAGEVRIO, both of which have lower gross margins.Non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses were $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 9% compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase primarily reflects higher administrative costs, including compensation and benefit costs, as well as higher promotional spending, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses were $3.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021. The increase primarily reflects charges related to collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion and higher clinical development spending.Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $105 million of expense in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $244 million of expense in the third quarter of 2021, reflecting lower pension costs.The non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 13.6% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 12.8% in the third quarter of 2021.Non-GAAP EPS was $1.85 for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $1.78 for the third quarter of 2021.A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income and EPS is provided in the table that follows.Third Quarter$ in millions, except EPS amounts20222021EPSGAAP EPS$1.28$1.80Difference0.57(0.02)Non-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below2$1.85$1.78Net IncomeGAAP net income1$3,248$4,567Difference1,455(42)Non-GAAP net income that excludes items listed below1,2$4,703$4,525Decrease (Increase) in Net Income Due to Excluded Items:Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs3$1,344$445Restructuring costs175168Loss (income) from investments in equity securities350(684)Net decrease (increase) in income before taxes1,869(71)Estimated income tax (benefit) expense(414)29Decrease (increase) in net income$1,455$(42)Financial outlookBeginning in 2022, Merck no longer excludes expenses for upfront and milestone payments related to collaboration and licensing agreements, or charges related to pre-approval assets obtained in transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions from its non-GAAP results. Historically, the company excluded these charges to the extent they were considered by the company to be significant to the results of a particular period. These changes were made to align with views expressed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. For 2021, non-GAAP results have been recast to include $1.7 billion of incremental R&amp;D expense, resulting in revised full-year 2021 EPS of $5.37.Full-year 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP results include $690 million of incremental R&amp;D expense, recorded in the third quarter of 2022, for collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion which negatively impacts expected full-year EPS by $0.22.As an on-going practice, the financial outlook will not include significant potential business development transactions.Merck continues to experience strong global momentum across its key pillars of growth, particularly in oncology and vaccines. As a result, Merck is raising and narrowing its full-year outlook for sales and non-GAAP EPS, despite a negative impact from foreign exchange.At mid-October 2022 exchange rates, Merck expects sales growth of 20% to 21% in 2022, with full-year sales estimated to be between $58.5 billion and $59.0 billion, including a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4%, including a less than 1% incremental negative impact from prior sales outlook. Excluding LAGEVRIO, Merck expects sales growth of approximately 12% for full-year 2022.Merck expects its full-year non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 14%.Merck is lowering its expected full-year 2022 GAAP EPS to be between $5.68 and $5.73.Merck is raising and narrowing its expected full-year 2022 non-GAAP EPS to be between $7.32 and $7.37, including a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4% at mid-October exchange rates. Operational strength of approximately $0.20 is partially offset by the following negative impacts, which were not reflected previously in the outlook:An option payment to Moderna of $250 millionA less than 1% incremental impact from foreign exchangeThe non-GAAP range excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and costs related to restructuring programs as well as income and losses from investments in equity securities.The company is narrowing its expected full year sales range of LAGEVRIO to be between $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion. Merck shares profits equally with its partner, Ridgeback, which is reflected in cost of sales.The following table summarizes the company’s full-year 2022 financial outlook.GAAPNon-GAAP2Sales$58.5 to $59.0 billion$58.5 to $59.0. billion*Operating expenses$22.5 to $22.9 billion$21.3 to $21.7 billionEffective tax rateApproximately 11%Approximately 14%EPS**$5.68 to $5.73$7.32 to $7.37*The company does not have any non-GAAP adjustments to sales.**EPS outlook for 2022 assumes a share count (assuming dilution) of approximately 2.54 billion shares.A reconciliation of anticipated full-year 2022 GAAP EPS to non-GAAP EPS and the items excluded from non-GAAP EPS are provided in the table below.$ in millions, except EPS amountsFull-Year 2022GAAP EPS$5.68 to $5.73Difference$1.64Non-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below2$7.32 to $7.37Acquisition- and divestiture-related costsRestructuring costs(Income) loss from investments in equity securities$3,4006001,350Net decrease (increase) in income before taxes5,350Estimated income tax (benefit) expense(1,175)Decrease (increase) in net income$4,175Earnings conference callInvestors, journalists and the general public may access a live audio webcast of the call Thursday, Oct. 27, at 8:00 a.m. ET via this weblink.

More than 95 tons of precious metals including gold, silver and palladium-equivalent to US$850 million-could be recycled from unwanted electricals each year.Partnering with Rockwell, The Royal Mint will use patented chemistry and a PlantPAx® distributed control system to recover more than 99% of precious metals from the circuit boards of discarded laptops and mobile phones - reducing the environmental impact of e-waste in the UK and supporting The Royal Mint's broader sustainability goals.""This technology provides us with the opportunity to make a genuine impact on one of the world's greatest environmental challenges while helping to secure our future as a leader in high quality, sustainable precious metals,"" said Sean Millard, chief growth officer at The Royal Mint.

227,c63b4843-d796-3938-aac5-2daf279caf01,ROK,2022-10-27,Rockwell Automation (ROK) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-rok-report-q4-144502959.html,1666795502,STORY,['ROK'],"[Rockwell Automation Inc. ROK is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results before the opening bell on Nov 2.Q3 PerformanceIn the last reported quarter, Rockwell Automation’s earnings and revenues improved year over year and also beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being a positive 0.54%.Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRockwell Automation, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRockwell Automation, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Rockwell Automation, Inc. QuoteQ4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.11 billion, indicating growth of 16.9% from the prior-year quarter. The same for earnings is pegged at $2.94, suggesting an increase of 26.2% from the year-ago quarter. The earnings estimates have moved down 0.3% in the past 7 days.Factors to NoteRockwell Automation has been witnessing improvement in order levels in the past few quarters. In the last reported quarter, total orders rose 17% year over year, driven by robust demand for core automation and digital transformation solutions. Per the Federal Reserve, total industrial production rose at an annual rate of 2.9% in the July-September quarter. This might have contributed to the company’s order book in the fiscal third quarter.Strong demand for software and cyber security services and a robust order backlog are likely to get reflected in Rockwell Automation’s fiscal third-quarter top line. Improved material flow from key suppliers is likely to have improved component shipments in the quarter.These above-mentioned benefits might have been offset by the ongoing supply-chain constraints. The manufacturing supply chain continues to be strained by the sharp rise in demand and the ongoing shortages of electronic components, along with pandemic-related and other global events that have put additional pressures on manufacturing output and freight lanes.Story continuesInflated costs for commodities, components and freight services are expected to have dented the company’s margins in the quarter to be reported. The company’s focus on process improvement, price increase actions, functional streamlining and material cost savings are likely to have negated some of these impacts.Segment ExpectationsFor the Intelligent Devices segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 revenues is pegged at $953 million, suggesting an improvement of 11% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating profit in the segment is pegged at $216 million, suggesting a year-over-year surge of 30%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Software &amp; Control segment’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 sales is at $622 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 26%. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating profit is pegged at $197 million, calling for 64% growth from the prior-year quarter’s levels. Rockwell Automation is poised well to benefit from broadening the portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services while gaining from cloud investments.The consensus mark for the Lifecycle Services segment’s fiscal fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $532 million, indicating growth of 16% from the year-ago quarter. The segment is expected to generate an operating profit of $71 million in the quarter, suggesting a 91% jump from the prior-year quarter’s $37.1 million.What the Zacks Model IndicatesOur proven model doesn’t predict an earnings beat for Rockwell Automation this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: Rockwell Automation has an Earnings ESP of -2.43%.

228,6e299e7c-e6a5-37f9-82c5-9aaebb6a13cc,ROK,2022-10-27,Rockwell Automation (ROK) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-rok-earnings-expected-140202112.html,1666792922,STORY,['ROK'],"[Rockwell Automation (ROK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis industrial equipment and software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.2%.Revenues are expected to be $2.11 billion, up 16.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.15% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Rockwell Automation?For Rockwell Automation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Rockwell Automation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Rockwell Automation would post earnings of $2.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.66, delivering a surprise of +15.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Rockwell Automation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Market participants are keenly watching this reporting cycle as it will provide the most descriptive view of U.S. corporate strength amid threats of a near-term recession.In addition to revenues and net profit numbers of companies, several metrics of margins, like gross margin, operating margin and net margin will be closely monitored by investors. Moreover, the outlook of U.S. corporates will indicate, to a great extent, the health of the U.S. and global economy.We have identified five S&amp;P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are set to beat on third-quarter earnings. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful as an earnings beat is expected to drive stock prices going forward. These companies are — Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, The Williams Companies Inc. WMB, Albemarle Corp. ALB, Expedia Group Inc. EXPE and Marriott International Inc. MAR.S&amp;P 500 in Q3The U.S. stock markets witnessed a broad-based decline in third-quarter 2022. Wall Street rallied impressively in July and the first half of August. Historically, September is the worst-performing month on Wall Street. And this year, it was the most disastrous in a decade.The S&amp;P 500 Index tumbled 5.3% in third-quarter 2022, recording losses in three consecutive quarters for the first time since 2009. Mounting inflation across the world, rigorous interest rate hike, an ultra-hawkish monetary policy taken by the Fed and massive turbulence in global financial markets due to the soaring U.S. dollar were the primary reasons for this pathetic performance.Q3 Earnings Results So FarOur estimates for third-quarter earnings of the market’s benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, has shown a gradual decline in the past three and a half months. As of Oct 21, 99 companies of the S&amp;P 500 Index have reported results.Total earnings of these companies are down 4% from the same period last year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 64.6% beating revenue estimates. Our current estimate has projected that total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to be up 0.9% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues.Story continuesOur Top PicksFive S&amp;P 500 companies will report third-quarter 2022 earnings within next week. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExxon Mobil’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business.At the same time, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%. With the reopening of the global economy, crude oil prices are likely to remain high despite near-term growth concerns.Zacks Rank #2 XOM has an Earnings ESP of +1.39%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last seven days.Exxon Mobil recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 1.6%. The company is set to release earnings results on Oct 28, before the opening bell.The Williams Companies operates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States. With U.S. natural gas demand projected to grow significantly in the long term, WMB seems well positioned to capitalize on the same owing to its impressive portfolio of large-scale value-creating projects.In particular, the company's existing and expansionary development projects associated with the massive Transco gas transmission system are expected to boost Williams’ growth prospects. WMB’s thriving deepwater transportation business is another positive.Zacks Rank #1 WMB has an Earnings ESP of +1.53%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.7% over the last seven days.The Williams Companies recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 17.3%. The company is set to release earnings results on Oct 31, after the closing bell.Albemarle should gain from long-term growth in the battery-grade lithium market. It is expected to benefit from its actions to boost its global lithium derivative capacity. ALB will also benefit from the synergies of the Rockwood acquisition. The buyout has enhanced diversity across end markets.Albemarle also remains focused on executing its cost-reduction program. Its cost-saving actions are expected to support margins in 2022. ALB also remains committed to boosting shareholder returns by leveraging strong cash flows. It remains focused on maintaining its dividend payout. Albemarle has ample liquidity to meet its short-term debt obligations.Zacks Rank #1 ALB has an Earnings ESP of +3.64%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.

It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.

The company is set to release earnings results on Nov 3, before the opening bell.Expedia Group is benefiting from strong improvement across all its lines of business, owing to the increasing travel resiliency of people.

Further, EXPE is witnessing growth in its domestic and international businesses, which remains a positive factor. Considering these, total revenues are anticipated to witness a 36.2% rise in the current year.Zacks Rank #2 EXPE has an Earnings ESP of +14.08%.

Further, it will help augment the global supply of lower-carbon power.The project will make use of each participant’s technical know-how in production, operational experience, storage, distribution and export logistics to cover the end-to-end energy value chain.Moreover, the firms will bring their individual capabilities and expertise in air separation technology, hydrogen technologies, lower-carbon intensity and renewable natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), electrolysis-based technologies and petrochemicals.The consortium will also evaluate the potential of producing hydrogen using natural gas with CCS and renewable hydrogen via electrolysis to supply end-use markets, including ammonia, petrochemicals, power and mobility markets.Thus, if the project goes ahead, it could take advantage of the existing pipeline infrastructure along the Gulf Coast to supply lower carbon and renewable hydrogen to local industries.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $3.64 per share on revenues of $878 million.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin-focused upstream operator’s results in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Civitas’ previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the oil and gas producer beat the consensus mark primarily due to strong volumes. Civitas had reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.63, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.25. Revenues of $1.2 billion generated by the firm had also come in 17.7% above the consensus mark.CIVI missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters, resulting in a negative earnings surprise of 23.5%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Civitas Resources, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCivitas Resources, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCivitas Resources, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Civitas Resources, Inc. Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has been revised 3.7% upward in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 103.4% increase year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 362.2% jump from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderCivitas Resources is expected to have benefited from the surge in hydrocarbon realizations. In the second quarter of 2022, the company’s average sales price for oil and natural gas increased by 65.4% and 101.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period. The uptick is most likely to have continued in the third quarter, with commodity prices remaining strong on the back of geopolitical tensions, strained supply and robust demand. This price boost is likely to have buoyed the revenues and cash flows of Civitas Resources.The company is also expected to have reaped the reward of higher production during the quarter. CIVI continues to churn out an impressive output from its high-quality assets across the DJ Basin, where it focuses on growth through a combination of acquisitions and active drilling. In the previous three-month period, Civitas’ total output was up 10.2% quarter over quarter to 175,223 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. The uptick is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of robust productivity from the company’s flagship fields and contribution from buyouts.On a somewhat bearish note, Civitas’ total operating costs in the second quarter increased around 9.1% sequentially to $453.6 million. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the third quarter due to continued inflationary pressure. This is expected to have somewhat dented the company’s to-be-reported earnings.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Civitas Resources is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Civitas Resources has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $3.64 per share each.Zacks Rank: CIVI currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this earnings season.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Civitas Resources, here are some firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:Comstock Resources CRK has an Earnings ESP of +1.04% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is scheduled to release earnings on Nov 1.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For 2022, Comstock Resources has a projected earnings growth rate of 230.2%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Devon Energy DVN, Kimbell Royalty LP KRP, The Williams Companies, Inc. WMB, Alliance Resource Partners ARLP.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Energy Stocks to Grab TodayThe energy markets are in a state of upheaval, a situation that's unlikely to reverse until there's some sort of a conclusion to the war in Ukraine, or at least until Europe has more energy. This is unlikely to happen any time soon, despite the nuclear fuel that everybody seems to be buying from Russia because it's not under sanction, and despite the fact that fears of a global recession are beating down oil prices.In the Winter Fuels Outlook released in October 2022, the EIA said, ""Compared with last winter, in nominal terms, we forecast expenditures for homes that heat with natural gas will rise by 28%, heating oil by 27%, electricity by 10%, and propane 5% from October–March."" Colder temperatures and higher fuel costs will contribute to this (It expects Brent to average $93 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $95 per barrel in 2023).U.S. gasoline consumption in 2022 will decline 40,000 b/d from 2021 and stay near that level in 2023, as rising fuel efficiency offsets transportation demand.The EIA maintains that natural gas inventories will end the April-October injection season 6% below the 2017-2021 average.Demand is therefore expected to remain quite high and supply relatively limited, which is what we are also hearing from the street, as the U.S. remains capacity constrained at refiners while new investment remains low as greener fuels weaken the long-term outlook.While practically the entire sector is worth buying today, the refiners are the ones seeing a lot of growth and margin expansion, which also means that they're not necessarily the best income generators. But if you look further, you could find stocks with strong growth prospects that are also paying a handsome dividend:Story continuesDevon EnergyThe U.S.-based E&amp;P company is seeing solid growth in revenue and profits. This year alone, it's expected to grow revenue 67% and earnings 152%. 2023 growth rates are slower at a respective 2% and 9%. Estimates for this company have been coming down, but things could change after it reports on Oct 31.Especially because the Zacks model shows that a buy-ranked stock with a positive earnings ESP (expected surprise prediction) usually does better than expected. In this case, we have a #2 (Buy) ranked stock with an ESP of 0.29%. So let's see what it does.In the meantime, it's worth pointing out that Devon pays a very nice dividend that yields 8.35%.The shares also trade at a discount to their median level over the past year in terms of price to earnings (P/E). So they're cheap.Kimbell Royalty LPKimbell Royalty Partners, which owns and acquires mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties is expected to grow revenue and earnings by a respective 93% and 155% in 2022. Revenues are currently expected to decline around 3% next year although earnings will still expand 25%.The 2022 estimate is down a penny in the last 30 days, but this is still much higher than 60 days ago. The 2023 estimate remains unchanged. Therefore, it should be considered as more of a fine-tuning than an actual downward revision.The fact that the ESP is a positive 20.64% is additional evidence that the revisions trend is not negative. The ESP captures the difference between the most recent estimate and the average estimate, going by the logic that the latest estimate is more accurate, having considered the most recent factors affecting the company. When coupled with Kimbell Royalty's #2 rank, we also know that the stock has a fair chance of beating estimates when it reports on Nov 3.In addition, the company pays a dividend that yields 11.77%.The shares also trade at a 40% discount to their median levels over the past year. So they're definitely worth jumping into.The Williams Companies, Inc.A premier energy infrastructure provider in North America, The Williams Companies is expected to grow its revenue by around 1% this year and another 5% in the next. Its earnings are however expected to grow 15% and 14%, respectively. Estimates are moving higher on this company, both for 2022 and 2023. Since it doesn't report until Oct 31, we'll have to see if the positive revisions trend continues.It is however encouraging to note that the ESP for WMB is 1.53%, which along with its Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) rank, is indicative of a positive earnings surprise.Its dividend yields 5.39%.At 17.8X P/E, the shares also trade at a 22% discount to their median level over the past year, which makes them relatively cheap.Alliance Resource PartnersZacks #2 ranked Alliance Resource Partners is a diversified producer and marketer of coal to major U.S. utilities and industrial users.The oil crunch has increased demand for all kinds of energy, from the cleanest to the dirtiest, which is why there is increased demand for coal. Allied Recourse is a beneficiary of these trends, with expected 2022 revenue and earnings growth of 53% and 227%, respectively. In the following year, revenue is expected to grow 7% and earnings 25%. There are no estimate revisions in the last 60 days but notable improvements in the last 60 days. The #2 rank and 0 ESP are also indicative of a positive surprise when Alliance Resource reports on Oct 31.Its dividend yields 7.03%.Valuation is also cheap.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Williams Companies Inc. WMB, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR, Incyte Corp. INCY, Hubbell Inc. HUBB and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. LW.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:A Bear Market Rally or Markets Forming a Solid Base? 5 PicksWall Street is witnessing a good rally in October after a horrible September. Historically, several major stock market crashes happened this month. However, this year, it looks like October will see a happy ending.Month to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite — have advanced 9.7%, 5.9% and 3.6%. On the other hand, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plummeted 13.3%, 20.3% and 30%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are in bear market territory. That is why, financial experts have characterized the ongoing October rally as a bear market rally or a relief rally, similar to the one we saw from mid-June to mid-August.Although market participants are yet to be convinced about bottoming out, October's rally has some positives. Let's discuss briefly.Are Markets Trying to Form a Base?U.S. stock markets have seen extreme intraday fluctuations in the past one month. The Dow has recorded around 600-700 points of intraday swing and the Nasdaq Composite has seen 300-400 points of intraday swing. The S&amp;P 500 has registered 50-60 points of intraday swing in the past month. If we consider, pre-market movements of index futures, intraday fluctuations of these three indexes will be much wider.This clearly shows that investors are unleashing both ""Sale on the Rise"" and ""Buy on the Dip"" strategies to strengthen their portfolios. Since the market is uncertain about the future movement of the interest rate and Fed's tightening, investors are taking a short-term view and selling stocks to book quick profits. At the same time, markets are no longer showing a secular downtrend. This means that some sort of sentiments is growing among investors regarding bottoming out.Story continuesWhen such a situation arises, the market seems to form a base on which it can ride for the long term growth trajectory. In U.S. stock markets, this type of scenario has been visible in the past month. From here the market can witness a steep rise if a minimum positive clue comes from the Fed. Other PositivesLast week, The Wall Street Journal reported that some Fed officials are skeptical about the continuation of the central bank's aggressive rate hike and tighter monetary control. The officials have already started to express their desire to slow down the pace of rate hikes soon and to stop raising rates altogether early next year. They want to reduce the risk of a hard landing of the economy caused by the policy interventions of the Fed.The Fed has already hiked the benchmark lending rate by 3% in 2022. The cumulative effect of a higher interest rate regime takes time to be visible in the economy. A section of market participants led by Ark Investment Management believes that the central bank should not take decisions about the future course of interest rate movement based on lag indicators like nonfarm payrolls and inflation rates.Instead, the Fed should take a decision on lead indicators like declining commodity prices (except food and energy), growing accumulation of inventories on the part of manufacturers and retailers, gradual slowdown of the ISM manufacturing PMI and a decline in the job openings rate. All these lead indicators point to the cooling down of the U.S. economy.Stock Selection ProcessAn upward EPS estimate revision for any stock for the rest of 2022 simply means that the market is expecting the company to do good business this year. A positive estimate revision within the last 30 days means that the market is thinking positively about the company.Therefore, a positive EPS estimate revision under growing threats of inflation highlights the solid business model and robust growth potential of a company. Investors can certainly take a look at these stocks that currently have strong earnings momentum.We have narrowed our search to five such large-cap U.S. companies with strong potential for the rest of 2022. These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Williams Companies Inc. operates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States. With U.S. natural gas demand projected to grow significantly in the long term, WMB seems well positioned to capitalize on the same owing to its impressive portfolio of large-scale value-creating projects.In particular, the company's existing and expansionary development projects associated with the massive Transco gas transmission system are expected to boost Williams' growth prospects. WMB's thriving deepwater transportation business is another positive.The Williams Companies has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.1% over the last seven days.Interactive Brokers Group Inc. operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. IBKR specializes in executing and clearing trades in securities, futures, foreign exchange instruments, bonds, and mutual funds.Interactive Brokers Group's efforts to develop proprietary software (including IBKR Lite), its low level of compensation expenses relative to net revenues and an increase in emerging market customers will likely continue aiding its financials. The acquisition of the retail unit of Folio Investments will strengthen IBKR's position in the online brokerage space.Interactive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 16.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.8% over the last seven days.Incyte Corp. focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of various therapeutics in the United States. lINCY's lead drug, Jakafi, higher royalty revenues and encouraging uptake of other recently approved drugs maintain momentum for the company. Jakafi's label expansion in additional indications is anticipated to further drive sales, and the company has raised the bottom end of full-year Jakafi net product revenue guidance.The recent FDA approval of ruxolitinib cream under the brand name Opzelura has diversified the portfolio of Incyte. The uptake of Pemazyre and other newly approved drugs like Monjuvi and Tabrecta is positive and should boost sales. The label expansion of these drugs is also positive and will generate incremental sales.Incyte has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.Hubbell Inc. is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of electrical and electronic products to commercial, industrial, utility and telecommunications markets. HUBB's products include plugs, receptacles, connectors, lighting fixtures, high voltage test and measurement equipment and voice and data signal processing components. Hubbell operates through two segments — Electrical Solution and Utility Solution.HUBB has an expected earnings growth rate of 23.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 1% over the last seven days.Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. produces, distributes, and markets value-added frozen potato products worldwide. LW's top line has been benefiting from robust price/mix, as witnessed during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The price/mix increased 19%, reflecting gains from pricing actions in the core business segments to counter input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation.Lamb Weston's top and bottom lines increased year over year in the quarter. LW saw net sales growth across all three reporting segments. While the macro environment remains volatile, management is on track to deliver results at the high end of the sales and earnings target in fiscal 2023. In addition, Lamb Weston has been keen on boosting production capacity to fuel long-term growth.Lamb Weston has an expected earnings growth rate of 45.7% for the current year (ending May 2023).

Williams had reported adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s adjusted EBITDA is pegged at $671 million for the to-be-reported quarter, up from the prior-year period’s level of $630 million.The Northeast G&amp;P unit — engaged in natural gas gathering and processing along with the NGL fractionation business in Marcellus and Utica shale regions — is also expected to have done well in the to-be-reported quarter.

The year-over-year improvement in realizations has most likely buoyed Black Stone Mineral’s revenues and cash flows.On a further bullish note, BSM is likely to have experienced an increase in output on the back of increased drilling activity and production growth across its mineral position. Consequently, the consensus mark for the partnership’s Q3 volume is pegged at 914,000 barrels, up from the previous quarter’s level of 899,000 barrels.On a somewhat bearish note, Black Stone Minerals’ total operating costs in the second quarter more than doubled year over year to $19.5 million. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the third quarter due to persistent inflationary pressure. This is expected to have somewhat dented BSM’s to-be-reported earnings.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Black Stone Minerals is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter.

It anticipates a further strengthening next year.As a result, it estimates a 13% to 17% jump in operating revenue in the fourth quarter versus the same period of 2019 even as capacity is projected to be down about 2%.""While there's noise regarding whether we are headed into a recession or not or whether we may even be in one now, we have not seen any noticeable impact on our booking and revenue trends,"" Chief Executive Officer Bob Jordan said on an earnings call.The company's shares were up 2.8% at $35.34 in afternoon trade.Southwest is the latest U.S. airline to play down demand concerns.The airline industry, which is facing higher fuel and wage bills, has been relying on strong consumer demand to mitigate inflationary pressure with higher fares. Investors are worried that a recession could hit travel spending, hurting the industry's profits.Carriers, however, say an unquenched thirst for travel, hybrid work arrangements and limited airline capacity due to aircraft and pilot shortages would keep their business humming.AIRCRAFT DELIVERIESSouthwest expects aircraft delivery delays to persist into 2024. It is contractually scheduled to receive deliveries of 114 737 MAX jets from Boeing this year, but a portion of them is expected to be delayed as the U.S. planemaker continues to face supply chain challenges and regulatory hurdles in the certification of the 737 Max 7.Southwest, Boeing's biggest 737 customer, said it expects no 737 Max 7 deliveries this year and has converted 17 orders for next year to the 737 Max 8.Story continuesBoeing faces a late December deadline for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to certify the MAX 7 under existing rules.Southwest said while Boeing is ""very confident"" of securing certification or an extension for MAX 7, its network and business plan for next year assumes no deliveries of the aircraft.The airline expects to fully restore its network to pre-pandemic levels by December 2023. But fleet utilization is expected to be limited by pilot staffing constraints for the majority of next year, fueling cost pressures.Southwest said it is ""on track"" to hire 1,200 pilots this year and 2,100 pilots next year.It said reinstating its dividend is a ""high"" priority for the company. It also plans to resume share repurchases ""at the right time.""Third-quarter adjusted net income was 50 cents per share versus analysts' expectations of 42 cents per share.

PWR, KBR, Inc. KBR, ChampionX Corp. CHX, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL and Atlas Technical Consultants, Inc. ATCX.Industry: EngineeringLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1996659/5-engineering-rd-services-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-challengesSupply chain constraints and input cost headwinds are taking a toll on the Zacks Engineering – R&amp;D Services industry. Labor constraints are making things worse. Nonetheless, the U.S. administration's focus on infrastructural enhancement has been creating the need for advanced construction and engineering solutions.Also, the companies' shift toward digital transformation, mergers &amp; acquisitions as well as operational efficiencies should lend support to the industry. Increasing investments in the decarbonization of energy efficiency and energy transition projects also appear to be growth drivers.Overall, the consistent focus on enhancing the infrastructure of the country's defense, healthcare, communication and renewable energy is encouraging for prominent industry players like Quanta Services, Inc., KBR, Inc., ChampionX Corp., Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. and Atlas Technical Consultants, Inc..Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Engineering – R&amp;D Services industry primarily consists of engineering and infrastructure service providers. The companies basically provide construction, technical, engineering and professional services to a number of industries worldwide, including oil and gas, chemical and petrochemicals, transportation, mining and metals, power, agriculture, consumer applications as well as manufacturing. The companies also make engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions as well as chemistry solutions along with engineered equipment and technologies for oil and gas companies worldwide.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Engineering - R&amp;D Services IndustryFocus on Defense, Healthcare, Communication &amp; Renewable Energy: The federal government's investment in defense and cyber security is conducive to the industry's growth. Owing to the sensitivity of their jobs, the Department of Defense and Homeland Security have the maximum budgets for cyber security among the government agencies.Story continuesAlso, increasing public investments in transportation, water infrastructure, utility plants and the healthcare market are anticipated to be conducive to the industry's growth. Additionally, the infrastructure services business of the industry players continues to thrive, supported by robust demand from the communications industry.The companies are well-positioned to gain from the renewable energy drive of the pro-environmental Biden administration. The development and deployment of technology solutions across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including carbon management mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as all facets of infrastructure for providing carbon-free energy solutions, should benefit the companies going forward. Also, the players are gaining from the rising global demand for alternative nuclear energy as they provide engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance services to nuclear power plants.Need for State-Of-The-Art Services: Increasing construction activities in U.S. government projects, which require state-of-the-art construction and engineering services, are expected to benefit the construction and engineering services industry. Also, the rapid usage of advanced technologies to deliver smart buildings and mega-projects while identifying and checking margin contraction and costs are expected to be a major tailwind for the industry participants.Supply-Chain Disruptions, Labor Shortage, Uncertain Economic Conditions &amp; Competition: The companies continue to face high input costs and labor constraints. Apart from this, supply chain disruption is a major cause of worry. As the impact of the coronavirus outbreak continues, uncertain global economic conditions may put pressure on the demand for services provided by the industry players.Meanwhile, the companies face intense competition in the global engineering, procurement and construction industry, hurting their contract prices and profit margins. Volatility in commodity prices and the cyclical nature of the industry's commodity-based business lines pose significant challenges too.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Engineering – R&amp;D Services industry is a 21-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #190, which places it at the bottom 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a tepid earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's bottom-line growth potential. Since May 2022, the industry's earnings estimates for 2022 have been revised 8.3% downward.Despite the industry's dreary near-term view, we will present a few stocks that one may consider adding to their portfolio. Before that, it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector, S&amp;P 500The Zacks Engineering – R&amp;D Services industry has performed better than the Zacks Construction sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Over this period, the industry has declined 4.3% compared with the sector's 24.1% decline. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 19% in the said period.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Engineering – R&amp;D Services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 18.2 versus the S&amp;P 500's 16.3 and the sector's 10.6.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.7X, as low as 10.2X and at a median of 16.9X.5 Engineering - R&amp;D Services Stocks to WatchBelow, we have discussed five stocks from the industry that have solid earnings growth potential.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, operating revenues were $22.2 billion, compared with $17.3 billion for the corresponding period in 2021, an increase of 28.2 percent.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Southern Company is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.34 per share for SO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.38% heading into earnings season.Southern Company The Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company The Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company The price-eps-surprise | Southern Company The QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that SO has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Southern Company, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

An improvement in economic conditions after the pandemic has been generating fresh demand for utility services.Domestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities.Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate the utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulation of emissions, the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also urging the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from the near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Per the updated outlook of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have created higher demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.Per the latest Earnings Trends report, the utility sector’s third-quarter earnings are expected to decline 9.3%, while revenues are estimated to improve 1.8%.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

This compares to FFO of $1.78 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 4.78%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $2 per share when it actually produced FFO of $2.02, delivering a surprise of 1%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Mid-America Apartment Communities , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry, posted revenues of $520.78 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $452.58 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Mid-America Apartment Communities shares have lost about 32.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for Mid-America Apartment Communities?While Mid-America Apartment Communities has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Mid-America Apartment Communities: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $2.20 on $515.79 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.29 on $1.99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Residential is currently in the bottom 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Veris Residential (VRE), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 2.This real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.4%.

The current annual dividend rate is $5.00 per common share. The timing and amount of future dividends will depend on actual cash flows from operations, MAA's financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other factors as MAA's Board of Directors deems relevant. MAA's Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy from time to time.2022 Earnings and Same Store Portfolio GuidanceMAA is updating its prior 2022 guidance for Net income per diluted common share, Core FFO per Share and Core AFFO per Share, along with its expectations for growth of Property revenue, Property operating expense and NOI for the Same Store Portfolio in 2022.FFO, Core FFO and Core AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures. Acquisition and disposition activity materially affects depreciation and capital gains or losses, which combined, generally represent the majority of the difference between Net income available for common shareholders and FFO. As discussed in the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures found later in this release, MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts', or NAREIT's, definition, and Core FFO represents FFO further adjusted for items that are not considered part of MAA's core business operations. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that Core FFO excludes not only depreciation expense of real estate assets and certain other non-routine items, but it also excludes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.2022 GuidancePrevious RangePrevious MidpointRevised RangeRevised MidpointEarnings:Full Year 2022Full Year 2022Full Year 2022Full Year 2022Earnings per common share - diluted$5.65 to $5.89$5.77$5.59 to $5.75$5.67Core FFO per Share - diluted$8.13 to $8.37$8.25$8.37 to $8.53$8.45Core AFFO per Share - diluted$7.34 to $7.58$7.46$7.59 to $7.75$7.67MAA Same Store Portfolio:Property revenue growth11.5% to 12.5%12.0 %13.0% to 14.0%13.5 %Property operating expense growth6.5% to 7.5%7.0 %7.0% to 7.5%7.25 %NOI growth14.0% to 16.0%15.0 %16.0% to 18.0%17.0 %MAA expects Core FFO for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be in the range of $2.19 to $2.35 per Share, or $2.27 per Share at the midpoint. MAA does not forecast Net income per diluted common share on a quarterly basis as MAA generally cannot predict the timing of forecasted acquisition and disposition activity within a particular quarter (rather than during the course of the full year).

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Mid-America Apartment Communities in FocusHeadquartered in Germantown, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -32.9% so far this year. The real estate investment trust is paying out a dividend of $1.25 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.25% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.64% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5 is up 22% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Mid-America Apartment Communities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.95%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Mid-America Apartment Communities's payout ratio is 57%, which means it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MAA expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $8.29 per share, with earnings expected to increase 18.26% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that MAA is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The mean price target of $209.08 indicates a 35.8% upside potential.The average comprises 13 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $178 to a high of $232, with a standard deviation of $14.41. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 15.6% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 50.7% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for MAA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for MAAHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why MAA Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, two estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 0.1%.Moreover, MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much MAA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

256,1a7696ab-858b-3e87-81db-8ab198f317a3,CI,2022-10-27,Cigna's (NYSE:CI) 23% CAGR outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same three-year period,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cignas-nyse-ci-23-cagr-110013000.html,1666868413,STORY,['CI'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. Just take a look at Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), which is up 79%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 24% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 50% in the last year , including dividends .Since it's been a strong week for Cigna shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Cigna To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Cigna was able to grow its EPS at 15% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Cigna's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Cigna's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Cigna, it has a TSR of 84% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Cigna shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 50% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Cigna better, we need to consider many other factors.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.74% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.01%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.15%.Heading into today, shares of the health insurer had gained 11.99% over the past month, outpacing the Finance sector's gain of 3.51% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.58% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Cigna as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be November 3, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Cigna to post earnings of $5.70 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 0.52%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $44.87 billion, up 1.25% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $23 per share and revenue of $180.34 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.36% and +3.6%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Cigna. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electronics maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.22 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TE Connectivity?For TE Connectivity, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that TE Connectivity will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TE Connectivity would post earnings of $1.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.86, delivering a surprise of +6.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TE Connectivity doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Another cohort of major aerospace &amp; defense stocks like Textron Inc. TXT, Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC and L3Harris Technologies LHX are set to announce their earnings on Oct 27.Factors That Influenced Aerospace &amp; Defense StocksGrowing global air travel demand, driven by a steady recovery in the domestic space as well as improving trends observed in international air travel, is expected to significantly boost the Q3 results of aerospace and defense stocks, particularly those engaged in commercial aviation. Evidently, Boeing witnessed a solid year-over-year surge of 31.8% in its commercial shipments during the third quarter. With Boeing being the largest jet maker in the nation, we expect the Q3 results of the remaining aerospace majors to reflect a similar improvement in delivery trends. Such solid deliveries must have boosted the overall top-line growth of the Aerospace sector, which houses all aerospace and defense stocks.Stocks in this industry that are more focused on combat must have gained as a result of steady government support. Moreover, a steady order flow observed in the past couple of quarters, along with improving delivery trends in recent times, buoyed by recovering economic trends are projected to have bolstered Q3 revenues of aerospace and defense stocks.However, persistent headwinds like supply chain disruption along with some unfavorable project timing as the result of coronavirus might have an adverse impact on the Q3 bottom line of the industry.Q3 ProjectionsAerospace sector Q3 earnings are expected to slip 0.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure, while revenues are projected to improve 8.2%.  For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through the latest Earnings Preview.Story continuesAerospace &amp; Defense Stocks to WatchLet's take a look at three defense companies that are scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 27 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcements.Textron’s Q3 results are likely to reflect mixed segmental performance. Notably, a steady air travel trend has been boosting the commercial aviation market, which in turn must have bolstered TXT’s aviation segment’s Q3 performance, while lower revenues related to lower H-1 production are expected to have hurt the performance of the Bell segment.The addition of PIPISTREL, post its acquisition this April, must have also boosted Q3 revenue growth (read more: Will Mixed Segment Performance Aid Textron's Q3 Earnings?).According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Northrop Grumman's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Northrop Grumman is:42% = US$5.7b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.42 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Northrop Grumman's Earnings Growth And 42% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Northrop Grumman has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Northrop Grumman's moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Northrop Grumman's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 4.0% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is NOC worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether NOC is currently mispriced by the market.Is Northrop Grumman Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Northrop Grumman has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 25% (or a retention ratio of 75%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, Northrop Grumman has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 27%. Regardless, Northrop Grumman's ROE is speculated to decline to 27% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Northrop Grumman's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

You can skip our detailed discussion on the Dow and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks that Hedge Funds Love. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or DJIA, is a stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on the US stock exchanges. DJIA is down 13.13% year-to-date, but this decline is comparatively less severe than the 19.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of October 24. Some of the most prominent Dow stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The Dow has maintained its individuality by being the price-weighted index in the US stock market. Though the index tracks the performance of just 30 companies, investing in the Dow provides exposure to some of the best names in the market, providing value to beginner investors. Moreover, these industry-leading companies are also favored because of their dividends and yields. Over the years, the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA have shown a strong correlation, however, their performances have branched off in the past. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, the Dow has slightly outperformed the broader market in the last 30 years ending June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, while DJIA returned 11.16%.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:Nearly all companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are dividend players.

In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8. Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

If you want to see more of the best global dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Given several decades of rising globalization, many leading American companies do business around the world. Leading companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) sell Windows in the United States, Europe, and China, for example.The leading companies have gone global to try to increase their market sizes. With larger market sizes, companies have more potential consumers, and more potential revenue opportunities. With more potential revenue, there's potential for more profits.Helping with this process is that many markets enjoy close ties with the United States. Major countries in Europe, for example, have been allies with the United States for many decades. Even countries like China have had strong relations with the United States such that trade between the two country amounted to almost $560 billion in total two way trade in 2020. The close ties makes doing business easier and helps facilitate the flow of capital.Another reason for many American companies doing business globally is the U.S. dollar. Given the U.S dollar is the dominant global reserve currency, many emerging countries want it to develop and the U.S. dollar generally goes further in terms of purchasing power as a result in the emerging countries. As a result, leading U.S. companies that expand in emerging markets can often do it more cheaply because the U.S. dollar has more purchasing power.Lastly, many leading U.S. companies go global because there is often less competition in emerging markets than in the U.S. market. With less competition, it's easier to gain market share and to make profits.2022 has been a challenging year in the markets given the higher inflation, the interest rate hikes by the Fed, and the Ukraine Russian war. As a result of the headwinds, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 19.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has fallen 29.3% year to date.Story continuesGiven the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the dividend sector, here are 10 stocks that are global in terms of their operations and that also have an attractive dividend to consider.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now, we took 10 stocks with substantial earnings power that had global operations and also paid a dividend. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders in our database that held shares of the same stocks at the end of Q2 2022.10 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 3.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a pretty global company. According to Statista, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)'s U.S. sales were $29.75 billion in 2021 while its Developed Europe sales were $18.3 billion, its Developed Rest of World sales were $12.5 billion and its Emerging Markets sales were $20.7 billion for the same year.Given the company's dividend yield of 3.51% as of 10/25, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also a dividend stock as well. If Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) exceeds expectations in terms of innovation, both the world and stock holders could benefit.Alongside Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also a global dividend stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the second quarter.9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 1.12%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is also pretty global given it sells its pharmaceuticals in the U.S., EU, Japan, China, and elsewhere.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has also been a pretty strong performer in terms of its stock. While the broader market has declined substantially in 2022, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stock has risen over 27% year to date. Shares are near an all time high as analysts expect Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) earnings per share to grow substantially in the future. If EPS grows, the company's dividend could grow too. As of 10/25, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have a dividend yield of 1.12%.Baron Funds commented on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment is in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 2.79%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Given it has operations in more than 180 countries, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a global company.

NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 72Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1.33%With North America accounting for around 41% of the company's total sales, NIKE, Inc.

(NYSE:NKE)'s recent headwinds in a Q3 2022 letter,“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) (-18.4%): The company spent most of the quarter trading about in line with the overall market. But on the last day of the quarter, they reported earnings that demonstrated strong consumer demand, but a series of geographic and product level inventory level issues. Given the start-stop nature of their production during COVID, strained global supply chains, and China consumers popping in and out of lockdowns, the company ended up with too much apparel inventory and announced they’d be slashing prices on certain items to reset inventory to appropriate levels quickly.”While NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has headwinds, the stock nevertheless has potential earnings growth potential in the future given the increasing global population and rising global wealth.As of 10/25, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares have a dividend yield of 1.33% and a payout ratio of 33.2%. With the relatively low payout ratio, NIKE, Inc.

272,ce786d81-b3c9-3ccf-8305-6bd0c240b8af,NKE,2022-10-27,Returns On Capital At NIKE (NYSE:NKE) Paint A Concerning Picture,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-nike-nyse-nke-140026574.html,1666792826,STORY,['NKE'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at NIKE (NYSE:NKE), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NIKE:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$6.2b ÷ (US$41b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2022).Thus, NIKE has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Luxury industry average of 15%. See our latest analysis for NIKE roceIn the above chart we have measured NIKE's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of NIKE's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 26%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom Line On NIKE's ROCETo conclude, we've found that NIKE is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 75% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesNIKE could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation  on our platform quite valuable.NIKE is not the only stock earning high returns.

The impairment charges were driven by non-operating factors including higher interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations.The adjusted amounts in this release exclude a noncash pension settlement charge. The pension settlement charge resulted from the purchase of a group annuity contract, which was an action taken to streamline administration, manage financial risk associated with pension plans, and to transfer a portion of the liability associated with VF's U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. Total expense was approximately $92 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023.Combined, the above items negatively impacted earnings per share by $1.04 during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and $1.26 during the first six months of fiscal 2023. All adjusted amounts referenced herein exclude the effects of these amounts.Reconciliations of measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identifies and quantifies all excluded items, and provides management’s view of why this information is useful to investors. The company also provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results. Additionally, the impact of the payment of taxes and interest related to the dispute with the IRS regarding the Timberland acquisition in 2011 has been excluded from fiscal 2023 adjusted cash flow from operations.Forward-looking StatementsCertain statements included in this release are ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$1.0m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$44.44 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$45.70. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Kleber Santos.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Wells Fargo Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Wells Fargo insiders own about US$128m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Wells Fargo insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Wells Fargo has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.But note: Wells Fargo may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:PFE) Hampers Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insufficient-growth-pfizer-inc-nyse-120034094.html,1666872034,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 8.8x might make it look like a buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 15x and even P/E's above 28x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.Recent times have been advantageous for Pfizer as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. View our latest analysis for Pfizer peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Pfizer.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?Pfizer's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 140%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 138% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to slump, contracting by 13% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 9.4% per annum.In light of this, it's understandable that Pfizer's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.The Bottom Line On Pfizer's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Pfizer's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 1 warning sign for Pfizer that we have uncovered.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

""At a minimum, the public interest favors preserving the status quo.""Lawyers for Do No Harm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In its Sept. 15 complaint, Do No Harm said Pfizer's program was ""discriminatory on its face,"" running afoul of several civil rights laws and violating a federal ban on racial discrimination by companies that accept government healthcare reimbursements.Fellows receive two years of full-time jobs, fully-funded master's degrees, and employment at New York-based Pfizer after completing the program.Pfizer said Do No Harm lacked standing to sue and could not show irreparable harm, and that its claims would likely fail.The fellowship program ""does what Congress has encouraged and controlling law allows,"" Pfizer said.On Oct. 31, the Supreme Court will consider the future of affirmative action in higher education, as it hears arguments on race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.Among the precedents at risk is a 2003 Supreme Court decision where Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said race could be used as one factor among many to achieve diversity.Story continuesPfizer quoted approvingly from O'Connor, who said ""major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints.""The case is Do No Harm v.

If you want to see more of the best global dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Given several decades of rising globalization, many leading American companies do business around the world. Leading companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) sell Windows in the United States, Europe, and China, for example.The leading companies have gone global to try to increase their market sizes. With larger market sizes, companies have more potential consumers, and more potential revenue opportunities. With more potential revenue, there's potential for more profits.Helping with this process is that many markets enjoy close ties with the United States. Major countries in Europe, for example, have been allies with the United States for many decades. Even countries like China have had strong relations with the United States such that trade between the two country amounted to almost $560 billion in total two way trade in 2020. The close ties makes doing business easier and helps facilitate the flow of capital.Another reason for many American companies doing business globally is the U.S. dollar. Given the U.S dollar is the dominant global reserve currency, many emerging countries want it to develop and the U.S. dollar generally goes further in terms of purchasing power as a result in the emerging countries. As a result, leading U.S. companies that expand in emerging markets can often do it more cheaply because the U.S. dollar has more purchasing power.Lastly, many leading U.S. companies go global because there is often less competition in emerging markets than in the U.S. market. With less competition, it's easier to gain market share and to make profits.2022 has been a challenging year in the markets given the higher inflation, the interest rate hikes by the Fed, and the Ukraine Russian war. As a result of the headwinds, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 19.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has fallen 29.3% year to date.Story continuesGiven the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the dividend sector, here are 10 stocks that are global in terms of their operations and that also have an attractive dividend to consider.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now, we took 10 stocks with substantial earnings power that had global operations and also paid a dividend. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders in our database that held shares of the same stocks at the end of Q2 2022.10 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 3.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a pretty global company. According to Statista, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)'s U.S. sales were $29.75 billion in 2021 while its Developed Europe sales were $18.3 billion, its Developed Rest of World sales were $12.5 billion and its Emerging Markets sales were $20.7 billion for the same year.Given the company's dividend yield of 3.51% as of 10/25, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also a dividend stock as well. If Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) exceeds expectations in terms of innovation, both the world and stock holders could benefit.Alongside Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also a global dividend stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the second quarter.9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 1.12%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is also pretty global given it sells its pharmaceuticals in the U.S., EU, Japan, China, and elsewhere.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has also been a pretty strong performer in terms of its stock. While the broader market has declined substantially in 2022, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stock has risen over 27% year to date. Shares are near an all time high as analysts expect Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) earnings per share to grow substantially in the future. If EPS grows, the company's dividend could grow too. As of 10/25, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have a dividend yield of 1.12%.Baron Funds commented on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment is in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 2.79%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Given it has operations in more than 180 countries, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a global company. Although the strong U.S. dollar isn't good for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)'s near term international earnings, the company still has substantial earnings power. Given its 66 consecutive years of annual dividend increases and its dividend yield of 2.79% as of 10/25, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is also still a dividend stock.On 10/20, Lauren Lieberman of Barclays raised her price target on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) to $145 from $139 and kept an 'Overweight' rating citing that the company's fiscal first quarter results were better than expected and that management commentary has helped sentiment.7. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 72Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1.33%With North America accounting for around 41% of the company's total sales, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an international company. Lately, the company has faced some headwinds due to industry specific challenges as well as macro headwinds, however. Ensemble Capital explained NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s recent headwinds in a Q3 2022 letter,“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) (-18.4%): The company spent most of the quarter trading about in line with the overall market. But on the last day of the quarter, they reported earnings that demonstrated strong consumer demand, but a series of geographic and product level inventory level issues. Given the start-stop nature of their production during COVID, strained global supply chains, and China consumers popping in and out of lockdowns, the company ended up with too much apparel inventory and announced they’d be slashing prices on certain items to reset inventory to appropriate levels quickly.”While NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has headwinds, the stock nevertheless has potential earnings growth potential in the future given the increasing global population and rising global wealth.As of 10/25, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares have a dividend yield of 1.33% and a payout ratio of 33.2%. With the relatively low payout ratio, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) could raise its dividend in the future without its earnings increasing very much.6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 2.65%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global company given it has operations in over 175 countries.Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a dividend aristocrat given it has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years. As a result of the dividend increases, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares currently yield 2.65%. Like its dividend, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s earnings per share has trended higher with occasional dips in the long term.In terms of its EPS, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) had a relatively strong Q3 given adjusted EPS of $2.55 versus the consensus of $2.48.

The company reported earnings of $1.99 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 and increased from $1.93 reported in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues of $11.2 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11 billion but decreased 3% from the year-ago period due to generic competition for multiple myeloma (MM) drug, Revlimid and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by in-line products (primarily Eliquis and Opdivo) and new product portfolios (primarily Opdualag, Abecma and Reblozyl).  Our estimate for total revenues was $11.2 billion.However, shares are down in pre-market trading.The company’s shares have gained 16.7% in the year so far against the industry's decline of 25.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly DetailsRevenues from in-line and new product portfolios increased 8% (13% when adjusted for foreign exchange impacts) to $8.6 billion. Revenues increased 9% to $7.9 billion in the United States. However, revenues were down 24% outside the country.Total In-Line products revenues came in at $8 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in demand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for the same was $8.4 billion.  Within this segment, Eliquis drove growth for the company as sales increased 10% to $2.6 billion. Revenues in international markets were impacted by foreign exchange impacts. We note that Bristol-Myers has a collaboration agreement with Pfizer PFE for Eliquis.The companies collaborated in 2007. Pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all development costs, depending on the study. Profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMY a sales-based fee.Sales of the immuno-oncology drug Opdivo, approved for multiple cancer indications, were up 7% year over year to $2 billion. Sales matched our estimate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $2.1 billion. The label expansion of the drug boosted sales, driven by higher demand across multiple indications, including the Opdivo+Yervoy-based combinations for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the Opdivo+Cabometyx combination for kidney cancer and the Opdivo-based therapies for various gastric and esophageal cancers.Story continuesAnother MM drug, Pomalyst, generated sales of $886 million, up 4% year over year.Sales of the rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, grew 1% to $883 million.The leukemia drug, Sprycel, raked in sales of $560 million, up 2% year over year.Melanoma drug, Yervoy contributed $523 million to the top line, up 2%.New product portfolio revenues grew 61% to $553 million, driven by higher demand for Reblozyl (up 19% to $190 million), Abecma ($107 million), and Opdualag ($84 million).However, Revlimid revenues declined 28% to $2.4 billion from the year-ago quarter due to a loss of exclusivity, primarily in international markets. Our estimate for the same was $2.1 billion.  Abraxane revenues declined 33% due to the entry of authorized generics.Adjusted research and development expenses decreased 5% to $2.3 billion in the quarter. Adjusted marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 4%. Gross margin fell to 79.8% from 81.1% in the quarter.2022 GuidanceBristol-Myers continues to expect 2022 earnings of $7.44-$7.74. Revenues are anticipated to be around $46 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $7.52 per share on revenues of $45.79 billion. Revlimid sales are expected to be $9-$9.5 billion.Bristol Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Bristol Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBristol Myers Squibb Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Bristol Myers Squibb Company QuoteOther UpdatesThe FDA accepted the company’s supplemental new drug application for Camzyos for an expanded indication for the treatment of adults with symptomatic New York Heart Association class II-III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to improve functional capacity, improve symptoms and reduce the need for septal reduction therapy. The regulatory body has assigned a target action date of Jun 16, 2023.The European Commission approved the fixed-dose combination of Opdualag for the first-line treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with tumor cell PD-L1 expression &lt; 1%.The FDA approved Sotyktu, a first-in-class, oral, selective, allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.Our TakeBristol-Myers beat third-quarter estimates for earnings and revenues. Sales however declined year over year due to generic competition for Revlimid. Nevertheless, the approval of new drugs adds a new stream of revenues, which should boost growth in the coming quarters. Pipeline progress has been impressive and strategic collaborations will further expand the portfolio.Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector are Puma Biotechnology PBYI and Dynavax (DVAX). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Loss estimates for Puma have narrowed to 6 cents from 16 cents over the past 60 days. Puma surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other one, the average being 201.37%.Earnings estimates for Dynavax have increased to $1.74 from $1.15 for 2022 over the past 90 days.

In the last reported quarter, the company beat earnings expectations by 16.57%.The drug giant’s performance has been mixed with the company exceeding earnings expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing in one. The company has a four-quarter earnings surprise of 16.32% on average.Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise          Pfizer Inc. price-eps-surprise | Pfizer Inc. QuotePfizer’s stock has declined 22.8% this year so far against an increase of 0.1% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to NoteDirect sales and alliance revenues from partner BioNTech BNTX for COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty and Pfizer’s oral antiviral pill for COVID, Paxlovid are expected to be have been the key contributors to Pfizer’s sales in the third quarter.Regarding Pfizer/BioNTech’s Comirnaty, strong growth in international markets is likely to have made up for the slower pace of deliveries in the United States, like the previous quarter. Paxlovid is expected to have been a greater contributor to the top line than Comirnaty, backed by launches in several countries in 2022. Paxlovid’s utilization is expected to have increased in the third quarter due to a rise in BA.4/5 infections and resultant increases in hospitalizations and deaths.Our estimate for direct sales and alliance revenues from Comirnaty is $2.74 billion, while that for Paxlovid is $8.0 billion.Excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, higher alliance revenues from Pfizer’s key brand, Eliquis, higher sales of the Prevnar family of vaccines and drugs like Vyndaqel/Vyndamax and higher biosimilar revenues are likely to have contributed to sales growth in the third quarter of 2022.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prevnar and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax is $1.84 billion and $589 billion, respectively, while our estimates are $1.52 billion and $640.5 billion, respectively.Story continuesHowever, sales of a key medicine, Ibrance in the United States is likely to have declined due to increased competitive pressure and an increase in the proportion of patients using Pfizer’s Patient Assistance Program (which provides Ibrance free of charge to certain low-income patients). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ibrance is $1.41 billion, while our estimate is $1.43 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for oncology and vaccine products is $3.18 billion and $4.68 billion, respectively while our estimates are $3.40 billion and $4.36 billion, respectively.However, sales of some key drugs like Xeljanz, Sutent and Enbrel in international markets are likely to have declined in the third quarter, continuing the trend of the past few quarters. While Sutent sales are expected to have been hurt due to the loss of exclusivity, sales of Enbrel in key European markets and Japan are likely to have been hurt due to biosimilar competition. Lower prescription volumes globally as doctors’ prescribing patterns shift away from JAK inhibitors following label warnings are likely to have hurt Xeljanz’ sales in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xeljanz and Enbrel is pegged at $518 million and $223 million, respectively while our estimates are $611 million and $230 million, respectively.In the quarter, Pfizer acquired Global Blood Therapeutics for a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion, or $68.50 per share, in cash. The acquisition strengthens Pfizer’s position in rare hematology by adding Global Blood's only marketed drug, Oxbryta, which is approved for treating SCD in the United States, Europe and some other countries. The acquisition closed last week. Management may discuss integration plans on the third-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Pfizer time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Pfizer’s Earnings ESP is -1.32% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 per share is higher than the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.45 per share.

Online shoppers now rank in-person, box-free returns as the No. 1 preferred method for returning purchases made online, with returns by mail ranked as the fourth, significantly less desirable option when returns are required.Happy Returns A PayPal Company 'Returns Happen' consumer reportThese insights come from the second annual consumer report, 'Returns Happen' released today by Happy Returns, a PayPal company. The report details evolving habits of online shoppers, focusing on how attitudes toward online returns can inform merchant solutions.""Merchants are facing greater challenges with online returns heading into this holiday shopping season, including increased logistics costs due to inflation, higher return rates as more shopping moves online, and customer expectations for online returns that are easy and free,"" said David Sobie, VP of Happy Returns. ""Despite these challenges, the growing preference for in-person, box-free returns is a huge opportunity to deliver customers the seamless returns experience they're looking for, while significantly driving down costs by up to 40%.""Nearly 50% of Consumers Say They'll Be Returning Holiday Gifts This YearBefore making a purchase, 86% of consumers say they make a point to check a retailer's return policy. And while some retailers have turned to charging for returns, the desire for free returns is still very strong with 87% of consumers stating free returns are an important factor when purchasing items online.The survey also uncovered the following insights related to consumers' return preferences:In-person returns are the preferred return option: 54% of consumers prefer in-person drop off at either the retailer's store or third-party stores. This ranks high above home pickup, even when home pickup is free.Mail-in returns are a thing of the past: 79% of consumers try to avoid mail-in returns whenever possible, and this number skews higher for those under 30 (83%).Bracketing shows no signs of slowing down: Bracketing, the practice of purchasing multiple items with the intention of returning some, continues to be a trend among consumers. More than 1 in 3 consumers plan to bracket their purchases this holiday season, putting even more pressure on retailers.Economic pressures are driving up returns: Nearly 1 in 4 have been returning a greater percentage of their online purchases as a result of inflation and other economic pressures that are impacting their financial health. This number skews even higher for those under the age of 45.Story continuesHappy Returns boasts an expansive Return Bar network with more than 5,000 locations at retailers like Ulta Beauty, Staples, FedEx, and more, which offer consumers the ability to return items in-person, without needing to box the items or print a label. These return bars allow merchants to aggregate items and can save up to 40% on return shipping costs1.

For the quarter, the RiverPark Large Growth Fund (the “Fund”) lost 3.3% - a bit better than the S&amp;P 500 (-4.9% for the quarter) and about in line with the Russell 1000 Growth index (-3.6% for the quarter). Try to spare some time to check the fund's top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, RiverPark Large Growth Fund mentioned PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1998, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based multinational financial technology company with a $103.2 billion market capitalization. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) delivered a -52.68% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -63.28%. The stock closed at $89.24 per share on October 25, 2022.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.""Story continuesPaypal PYPL Mastercard MA Visawww.BillionPhotos.com / Shutterstock.comOur calculations show that PayPal Holdings, Inc.

The interconnectedness of climate change and supply chain disruptions highlights the complexity of supply chains, including the impact in realizing the 2030 vision of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. These include the need for responsible consumption and production, decent work and economic growth, as well as driving climate action (SDGs 8, 12 and 13.) Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics interwoven in the fabric of global supply chains cut across virtually all 17 SDGs. Many solutions have been proposed, but one that is too often overlooked could be the most effective of all: AI. How can we help humans make better decisions in work that powers the world, work that matters.Take for example, global non-profit, Heifer International, that's working to sustainably end world hunger. Together with CATIE, an international organization focused on sustainable and inclusive human well-being in Latin America, the cooperative is working with farmers on a system that combines predictive AI technology with geospatial, weather, environmental and IoT field data in a comprehensive dashboard tailored to a farmer's land.Coffee drinkers consume more than half a trillion cups per year, and two-thirds aged 19-24 say they prefer to buy coffee that is sustainably grown and responsibly sourced. The industry's large global supply chain, however, makes tracing responsible business practices in the coffee supply chain difficult. The cooperative solution delivers weather alerts and other information, such as optimal planting patterns and expected yields linked to market pricing.These insights can help farmers and agribusinesses make more informed decisions for improving crop yield and value, as well as food safety, responsible land use, water stewardship, and ethical sourcing. The technology is expected to play an important role in increasing the incomes of coffee and cocoa farmers.Story continuesSustainability rising as a key business imperativeSustainability is no longer a nice to have; it has become top of mind for everyone. A recent IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) study found that Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCOs) rank sustainability as their third biggest challenge in the next few years, trailing only supply chain disruptions and technology infrastructure.Although there is an increased spotlight on sustainability where nearly half (49%) of all companies have corporate supply chain sustainability goals, another 35% lack such objectives, according to research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Transportation and Logistics and the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP).Whether your customer base is B2B or B2C - sustainability impacts your business' top and bottom line. Advancing corporate sustainability begins with a commitment to transparency and other capabilities like upstream thinking in product design and empowering responsible sourcing. Responsible sourcing, or ""ethical procurement"", is a voluntary commitment by companies to intentionally lead with social and environmental factors when managing their relationships with suppliers.Companies are looking for more responsible ways to source products and, given the current climate, are shifting their resources to businesses whose sustainable actions are speaking louder than their words. This sentiment is also shared among the consumer population. Recent data from an IBM survey of 16,000 global consumers found that 49% of consumers say they paid an average premium of 59% for products branded as environmentally sustainable or socially responsible. But should consumers have to pay more for sustainable products?Consumers demand for more transparency and sustainability into the entire supply chain of the products they purchase and consume are putting pressure for companies to reimagine their supply chains. In IBV's latest CEO study, boards are demanding 5X more transparency year over year around ESG performance which highlights the need for end-to-end data, visibility, and better automation across the breadth of global networks.Why AI?In response to the evolving global supply chain challenges, CSCOs are embracing innovative technologies like AI and automation as solutions to provide greater predictability, ecosystem interconnectivity and more responsible and sustainable operations.Automation and AI can enable CSCOs and their organizations to collect data, identify risk, validate documentation, and provide audit trails, even in high inflationary periods, while also managing their carbon, waste, energy, water consumption, and material utility.Companies who have cracked the code on supply chain sustainability aren't shy about their recipe for success.

VW also bought Argo shares from Ford for $500 million.Ford previously injected $1 billion into Argo when it bought control of the company in 2017. On Wednesday, it wrote down $2.7 billion in impairment charges.Before it acquired the stake in Argo, VW flirted with at least two other U.S.-based self-driving startups: Alphabet Inc's Waymo and Aurora Innovation.Story continuesVW reportedly considered a $13.7 billion investment in 2018 in Waymo for a 10% stake that would have valued Waymo at $137 billion.The value of Waymo just before then was estimated by Wall Street at $175 billion to $250 billion. Its most recent valuation by PitchBook of $30.75 billion dates to May 2020.The market cap of Aurora, which went public nearly a year ago, has sunk to $2.5 billion, from a 52-week high of more than $20 billion.When VW announced its initial investment in Argo in July 2019, it walked away from a development deal with Aurora, when the Silicon Valley firm was valued at $2.5 billion and backed by Hyundai Motor and Amazon.com Inc.Hyundai eventually formed a self-driving joint venture called Motional with Aptiv. Amazon bought self-driving startup Zoox.Argo's most recent valuation was $7.25 billion, but that was more than two years ago, according to investor website PitchBook. The company laid off 150 employees in July, when it said it was adjusting its business plan.The value of its nearest rival, the General Motors majority-owned Cruise, was estimated by PitchBook at $30 billion in January 2021, but its current value likely has dropped since key investor SoftBank sold its stake back to GM earlier this year. GM meanwhile is losing $2 billion a year on Cruise.Mobileye Global went public this week, but at a third of the $50 billion valuation it was targeting earlier in its IPO.The company, which was acquired by Intel Corp in 2017 for $15.3 billion, saw its market cap recover to more than $21 billion on Wednesday, reflecting the company's financial strength and reputation, particularly in assisted driving systems. Intel still holds a majority stake.(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

Earlier, Argo AI had been unable to attract new investors. Accordingly, Ford recorded a $2.7 billion non-cash, pretax impairment on its investment in Argo AI, resulting in an $827 million net loss for Q3,"" Ford said in a statement.Ford also said it sees its full-year adjusted EBIT forecast to be about $11.5 billion, which would be in the lower range of its $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion prior guidance. Ford says the updated figure would still be about 15% higher than the last fiscal year.Ford warned last month that Q3 adjusted earnings would be impacted by $1 billion in higher costs. Ford says these higher costs and 40,000 vehicles awaiting parts for completion weighed on results. Ford says it expects to complete the vehicles and sell them to dealers during the fourth quarter.“We’re asking ‘What’s best for customers?’ in everything we do,” Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “Winning for customers is driving a re-founding of the company through Ford+, with high ambitions for quality, innovation, profitability and growth across all our businesses – making smart choices about how we deploy capital even as we learn and adapt.”This story is developing and will be updated.Story continues—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This is in line with the accelerated target announced in September 2021, which is 5 years ahead of the 2030 target announced in early 2021 and 25 years ahead of the initial target of 2050, set in 2016. By achieving this accelerated goal, GM expects to avoid the production of an estimated 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions that would have been produced between 2025 and 2030, equal to the emissions produced by burning 1 billion pounds of coal.""We believe it is critical — to ourselves, to our customers and to the future of the planet — to step up our efforts and reach ambitious targets that move us closer to a more sustainable world,"" says Kristen Siemen, GM chief sustainability officer. ""Securing the renewable energy we need to achieve our goal demonstrates tangible progress in reducing our emissions in all aspects of our business, ultimately moving us closer to our vision of a future with zero emissions.""Sourcing renewable energy is a critical component of GM's plans to decarbonize. The company's renewable energy strategy is rooted in four pillars:Increasing Energy Efficiency: GM's energy goals begin with reducing energy consumption by improving energy efficiency. For 11 years, GM has been awarded the EPA Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award for its energy efficiency efforts.Sourcing Renewables: While it works to minimize the amount of energy required to run its facilities, GM also sources renewable energy through direct investment, on-site generation, green tariffs and power purchase agreements. This is the main way through which GM is achieving its renewable energy goal.Addressing Intermittency: GM is creating technology to store renewable energy over the medium and long term, so its power consumption is not disrupted by external fluctuations.Policy Advocacy: Policy efforts are essential to expand transmission, create microgrids that help deploy renewable energy and enable markets to price these solutions to enable a carbon-free resilient power system. GM supports policies that enable a carbon-free, resilient power system.Story continuesGM's renewable energy portfolio now includes sourcing agreements from 16 renewable energy plants across 10 states, continuing to lead all automotive OEMs as the largest offtaker of renewable power in the industry. Since 2017, the portfolio has also produced over $75 million of positive cash flows. In 2019, GM became a founding member of what is now known as the Clean Energy Buyers Association — the largest group of corporate renewable energy buyers in the U.S. CEBA brings companies together to unlock market access, helping organizations of all sizes find cost-effective pathways to buying renewable energy. ""General Motors has been a trailblazer in corporate clean energy procurement for manufacturing facilities for over a decade,"" said Miranda Ballentine, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association. ""Today's announcement of securing the energy needed to achieve their 2025 goal is another example of their leadership. But even more impressive has been GM's commitment to sharing their learnings and guiding other corporations who want to follow their lead. In a world of high competition, this community-orientation is truly wonderful.""In 2021, GM announced its Science Based Targets for emissions reduction, as well as plans to become carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040. In addition, the company plans to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new U.S. light-duty vehicles by 2035. GM has committed to invest $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, with plans to reach more than 1 million units of annual EV capacity in each of North America and China by the end of 2025.General Motors (NYSE:GM) is a global company focused on advancing an all-electric future that is inclusive and accessible to all. At the heart of this strategy is the Ultium battery platform, which will power everything from mass-market to high-performance vehicles.

Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.Retirement investing approaches of the past don't work today.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3%, and positive average annual dividend growth. Many stocks increase dividends over time, helping to offset the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Global Partners LP (GLP) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.63 per share, with a dividend yield of 8.23%. This compares to the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing - Master Limited Partnerships industry's yield of 7.11% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.22%. Check Global Partners LP (GLP) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) is paying out a dividend of $0.2 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.69% compared to the Financial - Savings and Loan industry's yield of 2.49% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 17.65% over the past year. Check OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) has a dividend yield of 3.68%. This is compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.66% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 20%. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:PNC were amply compensated",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-sold-us-3-4m-130059639.html,1666789259,STORY,['PNC'],"[The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:PNC) stock rose 4.5% last week, but insiders who sold US$3.4m worth of stock over the last year are probably in a more advantageous position. Selling at an average price of US$187, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$163). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.All up, insiders sold more shares in PNC Financial Services Group than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like PNC Financial Services Group better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At PNC Financial Services Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PNC Financial Services Group. Specifically, Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking Michael Lyons ditched US$584k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$230m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, PNC Financial Services Group makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.74%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.01%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.01%.Heading into today, shares of the retailer had gained 11.67% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 3.09% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.58% in that time.Target will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 16, 2022. On that day, Target is projected to report earnings of $2.14 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 29.37%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $26.33 billion, up 2.65% from the prior-year quarter.TGT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $8.09 per share and revenue of $109.76 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -40.34% and +3.55%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Target. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.12% higher. Target is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Target is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 20.48. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 22.65, so we one might conclude that Target is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, TGT's PEG ratio is currently 2.08. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Retail - Discount Stores stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.12 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Retail - Discount Stores industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this retailer have returned +11.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Target belongs, has gained 8.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Target is expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -29.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.09 points to a change of -40.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.12 indicates a change of +49.8% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $26.33 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. The $109.76 billion and $113.78 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.6% and +3.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $0.39 for the same period compares with $3.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.47%. The EPS surprise was -45.07%.Over the last four quarters, Target surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, the bottom line was lower than the prior-year quarter’s 92 cents.The results of Navient were affected by the fall in non-interest income and net interest income (NII). An increase in the provision for loan losses also dragged the results. Nonetheless, lower expenses aided the company.Navient’s GAAP net income was $105 million, down from $173 million in the prior-year quarter.NII &amp; Expenses Decrease, Provisions RiseNII (on a non-GAAP basis) was $247 million, down 17.4% year over year.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Analog Devices (ADI) earns a Zacks Rank #3 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 22, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.59 a share.Analog Devices' Earnings ESP sits at 0.32%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.59 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58.ADI is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. NetApp (NTAP) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.NetApp is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 29, 2022. NTAP's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.35 a share 34 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NetApp is $1.34, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.68%.Story continuesADI and NTAP's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Results are expected to reflect year-over-year growth in quarterly revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.This Boca Raton, FL-based communications tower REIT delivered a surprise of 3.02% in terms of adjusted FFO (AFFO) per share in the last reported quarter. Results reflected a robust operating performance in the site-leasing and development businesses, both on the domestic and international front. SBA Communications continued to benefit from the addition of sites to its portfolio.Over the preceding four quarters, SBAC’s AFFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average beat being 2.20%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSBA Communications Corporation price-eps-surprise | SBA Communications Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayThe advancement in mobile technology, such as the 5G network, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have fueled the rise.This has resulted in wireless service providers and carriers expanding their networks and deploying additional equipment for existing networks to boost their network coverage and capacity to meet the rising consumer demand.This upbeat trend is likely to have driven the demand for SBA Communications’ portfolio of wireless communications infrastructure during third-quarter 2022, aiding its top-line performance.Moreover, SBAC has a resilient and stable site-leasing business model. It generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases that have built-in rent escalators. This is likely to have supported stable site-leasing revenues for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.The consensus estimate for third-quarter site-leasing revenues, which account for the lion’s share of total revenues, is pegged at $578 million, indicating an increase of 7.8% from the year-ago quarter’s $536 million.We believe that to capitalize on the strong secular growth trends of the wireless industry, SBAC is likely to have continued with its asset base expansion with the addition of sites to its portfolio through acquisitions and developments during the quarter.Also, its solid balance-sheet strength is expected to have aided its efforts for 5G deployment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter site-development revenues is pegged at $70 million, suggesting growth of 29.6% from $54 million reported in the year-ago period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues is pegged at $652.8 million, implying year-over-year growth of 10.8%.SBA Communications’ activities during the quarter were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly FFO per share has been revised a cent upward to $3.04 over the past month. Also, it suggests year-over-year growth of 12.2%.Story continuesEarning WhispersSBA Communications has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: SBAC has an Earnings ESP of +0.44 %.

Leading companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) sell Windows in the United States, Europe, and China, for example.The leading companies have gone global to try to increase their market sizes. With larger market sizes, companies have more potential consumers, and more potential revenue opportunities. With more potential revenue, there's potential for more profits.Helping with this process is that many markets enjoy close ties with the United States. Major countries in Europe, for example, have been allies with the United States for many decades. Even countries like China have had strong relations with the United States such that trade between the two country amounted to almost $560 billion in total two way trade in 2020. The close ties makes doing business easier and helps facilitate the flow of capital.Another reason for many American companies doing business globally is the U.S. dollar. Given the U.S dollar is the dominant global reserve currency, many emerging countries want it to develop and the U.S. dollar generally goes further in terms of purchasing power as a result in the emerging countries. As a result, leading U.S. companies that expand in emerging markets can often do it more cheaply because the U.S. dollar has more purchasing power.Lastly, many leading U.S. companies go global because there is often less competition in emerging markets than in the U.S. market. With less competition, it's easier to gain market share and to make profits.2022 has been a challenging year in the markets given the higher inflation, the interest rate hikes by the Fed, and the Ukraine Russian war. As a result of the headwinds, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 19.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has fallen 29.3% year to date.Story continuesGiven the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the dividend sector, here are 10 stocks that are global in terms of their operations and that also have an attractive dividend to consider.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now, we took 10 stocks with substantial earnings power that had global operations and also paid a dividend. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders in our database that held shares of the same stocks at the end of Q2 2022.10 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 3.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a pretty global company. According to Statista, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)'s U.S. sales were $29.75 billion in 2021 while its Developed Europe sales were $18.3 billion, its Developed Rest of World sales were $12.5 billion and its Emerging Markets sales were $20.7 billion for the same year.Given the company's dividend yield of 3.51% as of 10/25, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also a dividend stock as well. If Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) exceeds expectations in terms of innovation, both the world and stock holders could benefit.Alongside Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also a global dividend stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the second quarter.9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 1.12%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is also pretty global given it sells its pharmaceuticals in the U.S., EU, Japan, China, and elsewhere.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has also been a pretty strong performer in terms of its stock. While the broader market has declined substantially in 2022, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stock has risen over 27% year to date. Shares are near an all time high as analysts expect Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) earnings per share to grow substantially in the future. If EPS grows, the company's dividend could grow too. As of 10/25, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have a dividend yield of 1.12%.Baron Funds commented on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment is in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 2.79%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Given it has operations in more than 180 countries, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a global company. Although the strong U.S. dollar isn't good for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)'s near term international earnings, the company still has substantial earnings power. Given its 66 consecutive years of annual dividend increases and its dividend yield of 2.79% as of 10/25, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is also still a dividend stock.On 10/20, Lauren Lieberman of Barclays raised her price target on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) to $145 from $139 and kept an 'Overweight' rating citing that the company's fiscal first quarter results were better than expected and that management commentary has helped sentiment.7. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 72Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1.33%With North America accounting for around 41% of the company's total sales, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an international company. Lately, the company has faced some headwinds due to industry specific challenges as well as macro headwinds, however. Ensemble Capital explained NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s recent headwinds in a Q3 2022 letter,“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) (-18.4%): The company spent most of the quarter trading about in line with the overall market. But on the last day of the quarter, they reported earnings that demonstrated strong consumer demand, but a series of geographic and product level inventory level issues. Given the start-stop nature of their production during COVID, strained global supply chains, and China consumers popping in and out of lockdowns, the company ended up with too much apparel inventory and announced they’d be slashing prices on certain items to reset inventory to appropriate levels quickly.”While NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has headwinds, the stock nevertheless has potential earnings growth potential in the future given the increasing global population and rising global wealth.As of 10/25, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares have a dividend yield of 1.33% and a payout ratio of 33.2%. With the relatively low payout ratio, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) could raise its dividend in the future without its earnings increasing very much.6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Dividend Yield as of 10/25: 2.65%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global company given it has operations in over 175 countries.Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a dividend aristocrat given it has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years. As a result of the dividend increases, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares currently yield 2.65%. Like its dividend, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s earnings per share has trended higher with occasional dips in the long term.In terms of its EPS, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) had a relatively strong Q3 given adjusted EPS of $2.55 versus the consensus of $2.48. Sales for the period were $23.8 billion versus the consensus of $23.34 billion. For FY22, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) expects adjusted operation EPS of $10.70-$10.75 and sales of $93 billion to $93.5 billion.Like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc.

And Spotify — similar to Alphabet — called out economic-related weakness in the advertising market as one reason for its tepid results.All three household name tech stocks plunged on the downbeat commentary. They were also the most visited ticker pages on Yahoo Finance as of Wednesday afternoon.American singer Ashlee Simpson poses for photographers to celebrate the launch of her Skechers Campaign on October 25, 2006 in London. (Photo by MJ Kim/Getty Images)But these tech giants aren't the only ones factoring into investor decision-making on Wednesday.Here are a few other hot tickers today that caught our attention:SkechersReporting earnings on Wednesday, Skechers missed Wall Street profit estimates, lowered its outlook, and saw inventories balloon 21% (the latest retailer to warn of bloated inventories).Chief Financial Officer John Vandemore said in the earnings release that the company faces “multiple macroeconomic headwinds, from foreign exchange rates to supply chain challenges and ongoing COVID-related lockdowns.”Skechers stock fell around 4%.VisaThe payments company had a strong third quarter, echoing what American Express CEO Stephen Squeri told Yahoo Finance about strong consumer spending right now.Payments volume at Visa grew 10% in the fiscal fourth quarter while processed transactions increased 12%.“As we’ve said before, we are not economic forecasters,"" the company's Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu said. ""Clearly, there’s a high risk of a global recession, but we do not have a specific point of view on if, when, or the kind of recession we might have.""Prabhu added that “for internal planning purposes,” Visa is “assuming no recession,"" but the company remains “vigilant” and will have “contingency plans in place should we have an economic or geopolitical shock that impacts our business.""Visa stock is up more than 4%.Story continuesHalliburtonShares of the oil major rose more than 5% as the company benefited greatly from higher prices for crude oil in the third quarter.Halliburton more than doubled its profits in the third quarter from a year ago, fueled by strong demand for oil-field services amid higher energy prices.CEO Jeff Miller said revenue grew by 6% from the previous quarter “as activity and pricing increased simultaneously in North America and International markets.”Miller believes structural demand for more oil and gas supply will continue to provide strong tailwinds for Halliburton’s business.One area of concern for oil bears to feast on: Revenue in the Europe and Africa region declined by 11% sequentially, almost entirely because of the exit from Russia.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

This is after beating on Q3 earnings. The payment company says it still sees strong consumer spending. Payments volume, that grew 10% in the quarter, while transactions grew 12%.And this comes back to the type of spending that consumers are more prone to do at this point in time, leaning towards some of the card products and card services out there, versus just saying, yeah, I'll pay with cash. They're trying to hold on to some of that cash, but.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and all this travel that we're talking about, right? How are people paying for that? They're putting it on their card. So, again, this speaks to the idea that we're not seeing an across the board, everything slowing down at once, right? It is very uneven here. And Visa's results, I think, are a good example of that.BRIAN SOZZI: American Express, good quarter last week. Visa, good quarter. I'm not surprised.BRAD SMITH: Well, and on the travel front, as you mentioned, American Express had cited global travel or corporate travel, especially given that American Express has so much of the corporate T and E that they kind of account for within that landscape--[BUZZER]--but for Visa, that clearly playing out for them, too.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.65 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.67%.

Market participants are keenly watching this reporting cycle as it will provide the most descriptive view of U.S. corporate strength amid threats of a near-term recession.In addition to revenues and net profit numbers of companies, several metrics of margins, like gross margin, operating margin and net margin will be closely monitored by investors. Moreover, the outlook of U.S. corporates will indicate, to a great extent, the health of the U.S. and global economy.We have identified five S&amp;P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are set to beat on third-quarter earnings. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful as an earnings beat is expected to drive stock prices going forward. These companies are — Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, The Williams Companies Inc. WMB, Albemarle Corp. ALB, Expedia Group Inc. EXPE and Marriott International Inc. MAR.S&amp;P 500 in Q3The U.S. stock markets witnessed a broad-based decline in third-quarter 2022. Wall Street rallied impressively in July and the first half of August. Historically, September is the worst-performing month on Wall Street. And this year, it was the most disastrous in a decade.The S&amp;P 500 Index tumbled 5.3% in third-quarter 2022, recording losses in three consecutive quarters for the first time since 2009. Mounting inflation across the world, rigorous interest rate hike, an ultra-hawkish monetary policy taken by the Fed and massive turbulence in global financial markets due to the soaring U.S. dollar were the primary reasons for this pathetic performance.Q3 Earnings Results So FarOur estimates for third-quarter earnings of the market’s benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, has shown a gradual decline in the past three and a half months. As of Oct 21, 99 companies of the S&amp;P 500 Index have reported results.Total earnings of these companies are down 4% from the same period last year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 64.6% beating revenue estimates. Our current estimate has projected that total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to be up 0.9% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues.Story continuesOur Top PicksFive S&amp;P 500 companies will report third-quarter 2022 earnings within next week.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExxon Mobil’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business.At the same time, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%. With the reopening of the global economy, crude oil prices are likely to remain high despite near-term growth concerns.Zacks Rank #2 XOM has an Earnings ESP of +1.39%.

The company is set to release earnings results on Oct 28, before the opening bell.The Williams Companies operates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States. With U.S. natural gas demand projected to grow significantly in the long term, WMB seems well positioned to capitalize on the same owing to its impressive portfolio of large-scale value-creating projects.In particular, the company's existing and expansionary development projects associated with the massive Transco gas transmission system are expected to boost Williams’ growth prospects. WMB’s thriving deepwater transportation business is another positive.Zacks Rank #1 WMB has an Earnings ESP of +1.53%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.2% for the current year.

343,87ceab20-a1bf-3fd2-9276-2688a6cc917a,KLAC,2022-10-27,KLA Corporation's (NASDAQ:KLAC) CEO Will Probably Have Their Compensation Approved By Shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kla-corporations-nasdaq-klac-ceo-110520678.html,1666868720,STORY,['KLAC'],"[We have been pretty impressed with the performance at KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) recently and CEO Rick Wallace deserves a mention for their role in it. The pleasing results would be something shareholders would keep in mind at the upcoming AGM on 02 November 2022. The focus will probably be on the future company strategy as shareholders cast their votes on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. In light of the great performance, we discuss the case why we think CEO compensation is not excessive. View our latest analysis for KLA Comparing KLA Corporation's CEO Compensation With The IndustryAt the time of writing, our data shows that KLA Corporation has a market capitalization of US$43b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$21m for the year to June 2022. Notably, that's an increase of 50% over the year before. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$997k.In comparison with other companies in the industry with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, the reported median total CEO compensation was US$19m. From this we gather that Rick Wallace is paid around the median for CEOs in the industry. Furthermore, Rick Wallace directly owns US$16m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.Component20222021Proportion (2022)SalaryUS$997kUS$975k5%OtherUS$20mUS$13m95%Total CompensationUS$21mUS$14m100%On an industry level, roughly 12% of total compensation represents salary and 88% is other remuneration. Interestingly, the company has chosen to go down an unconventional route in that it pays a smaller salary to Rick Wallace as compared to non-salary compensation over the one-year period examined. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.ceo-compensationKLA Corporation's GrowthKLA Corporation has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 46% a year over the past three years. Its revenue is up 33% over the last year.Story continuesShareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. The combination of strong revenue growth with medium-term EPS improvement certainly points to the kind of growth we like to see. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.Has KLA Corporation Been A Good Investment?Most shareholders would probably be pleased with KLA Corporation for providing a total return of 85% over three years. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.In Summary...KLA primarily uses non-salary benefits to reward its CEO. The company's solid performance might have made most shareholders happy, possibly making CEO remuneration the least of the matters to be discussed in the AGM. In fact, strategic decisions that could impact the future of the business might be a far more interesting topic for investors as it would help them set their longer-term expectations.CEO compensation is an important area to keep your eyes on, but we've also need to pay attention to other attributes of the company. That's why we did our research, and identified 3 warning signs for KLA (of which 1 is potentially serious!) that you should know about in order to have a holistic understanding of the stock.Switching gears from KLA, if you're hunting for a pristine balance sheet and premium returns, this free list of high return, low debt companies is a great place to look.Have feedback on this article?

provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.To supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain gains, costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our operating performance and our prospects in the future. Specifically, we believe that the non-GAAP information, including non-GAAP net income attributable to KLA, non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to KLA, non-GAAP gross margin and Free Cash Flow, provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results to help investors compare our operating performances with our results in prior periods as well as with the performance of other companies. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics are inherently subject to significant discretion (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric). As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP. The following are descriptions of the adjustments made to reconcile GAAP net income attributable to KLA to non-GAAP net income attributable to KLA:a.Acquisition-related charges primarily include amortization of intangible assets and other acquisition-related adjustments including adjustments for the fair valuation of inventory and backlog, and transaction costs associated with our acquisitions.b.Restructuring, severance and other charges primarily include costs associated with employee severance, acceleration of certain stock-based compensation arrangements, interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits, charges related to liquidation of legal entities, gains and losses from exiting non-core businesses, adjustments related to non-controlling interest and other exit costs. Restructuring, severance and other charges in the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2022 include a gain on the sale of Orbograph, Ltd. (""Orbograph""), which was sold in the quarter, partially offset by certain transaction bonuses triggered by the sale of Orbograph.c.Loss on extinguishment of debt includes a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of the $500 million 4.650% Senior Notes due in November 2024.d.Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments includes the income tax effects of the excluded items noted above.e.Discrete tax items in the three months ended Sept. 30, 2022 include an adjustment of the net benefit of the Orbotech Ltd. 2012 to 2018 Israel tax audit settlement, for which the net benefit includes the liability on the audit settlement less reductions in unrecognized tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Discrete tax items in this quarter also include a tax impact from the sale of Orbograph and a tax impact relating to the amortization of certain intellectual property as a result of an internal restructuring of ownership rights to align with how our business operates. Discrete tax items in the three months ended June 30, 2022 include an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Discrete tax items in the three months ended Sept. 30, 2021 include a one-time tax benefit of $394.5 million resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kla-corporation-reports-fiscal-2023-first-quarter-results-301660292.htmlSOURCE KLA Corporation]"

TPR, Designer Brands Inc. DBI, Hibbett, Inc. HIBB and Chico's FAS, Inc. CHS.Industry: Retail - Apparel &amp; ShoesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1996587/4-stocks-to-bet-on-in-an-inflation-hit-retail-apparel-shoes-industryProduct cost inflation, tight labor market and supply chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry have been encountering lately. These, along with geopolitical turbulence due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have been making things tough for companies. Evidently, demand for apparel has softened as consumers are spending more on necessities owing to soaring prices.To navigate troubled waters, industry participants have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. Retailers have been focusing on superior product strategy, advancement of omni-channel capabilities and prudent capital investments. Backed by these initiatives, companies like Tapestry, Inc., Designer Brands Inc., Hibbett, Inc. and Chico's FAS, Inc. are set to cash in on the opportunities.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry comprises companies that offer apparel, footwear, accessories, intimates and beauty products, as well as fitness and lifestyle products for use in yoga, training and sports under various brands in domestic and international markets. Quite a few players offer bag collections, including business cases, computer bags and backpacks; leather goods, such as wallets, card cases, travel organizers, and belts; and watches, sunglasses, fragrances and ready-to-wear as well as cold-weather accessories.Markedly, companies showcase products to customers directly through their branded retail stores, mobile applications, catalogs and websites. Some industry participants also provide products via department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites, and franchisees who operate brand-dedicated stores.Story continues4 Key Trends to Watch in the Retail - Apparel And Shoes IndustryPressure on Margins to Linger: The industry is quite fragmented, with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes such as price, products and speed-to-market. In a bid to address these, a significant number of players in the industry have been investing in strengthening their digital ecosystem and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors bolster sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Soft Consumer Activity May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry's prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. But higher gasoline and food prices have been discomforting the family budgets. The consumer price index rose to 8.2% in September 2022 on a year-over-year basis. The Fed's aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation are making things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income. Consequently, demand for apparel has softened, resulting in an inventory pile-up.Brand Enhancement, Capital Discipline: Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. The launch of newer styles, customization options and refreshed store environments enable them to woo shoppers. Efforts to enhance brand portfolio via marketing strategies, buyouts, innovations and alliances are likely to keep supporting players in the space.The companies have been taking steps to strengthen their financial position. In fact, they have been making every move, from managing inventory and closing underperforming stores to optimizing capital expenditures and enhancing operational efficiency.Diversification &amp; Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior amid the pandemic, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at a store, are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers' product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, companies have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry is a group within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

Adjusted gross margin* was down 760 basis points from prior year, as price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs including the impact of planned production curtailments, and lower volume.SG&amp;A was 19.4% of sales for the quarter. Excluding charges, third quarter adjusted SG&amp;A expenses* were 18.4% of sales, down 160 basis points versus prior year due to the successful implementation of cost control actions.Operating margin was 5.3% of sales for the quarter. Excluding charges, operating margin* was 6.2% of sales. The mix impact of Outdoor acquisitions was approximately 105 basis points dilutive to operating margin.The tax rate was a benefit for the quarter. Excluding charges, the adjusted tax rate* was (1.3%) reflecting the impact of discrete tax benefits and mix, which favored lower earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.Inventory at the end of the quarter was $6.3 billion, down $290 million sequentially reflecting the benefit from our production curtailments. Net working capital however, sequentially increased by approximately $265 million primarily due to lower payables, as a result of reduced production schedules. The Company expects continued inventory reduction in the fourth quarter, which will translate to net working capital improvement and positive cash flow.Third Quarter 2022 Segment Results($ in M)SalesProfitCharges1Profit Ex- Charges*Profit RateProfit RateEx- Charges*Tools &amp; Outdoor$3,495$228.4$10.6$239.06.5 %6.8 %Industrial$625$68.4$1.0$69.410.9 %11.1 %1 See Acquisition-Related And Other Charges On Page 5*  Non-GAAP Financial Measure As Further Defined On Page 8Tools &amp; Outdoor net sales increased 10% versus 3Q'21 as the acquisitions of MTD and Excel (+18%) and price (+7%) were partially offset by lower volume (-12%) and currency (-3%). The overall organic decline (-5%) was a result of lower consumer and DIY market demand. Regional year-over-year organic revenue included: Emerging markets (-2%), North America (-4%), and Europe (-12%). U.S. retail point-of-sale demand was supported by price increases and professional demand, which remained stable compared to levels exiting the second quarter 2022. The Tools &amp; Outdoor segment profit rate*, excluding charges, was 6.8%. Excluding charges and outdoor acquisitions**, the segment profit rate* was 8.2%. The segment profit rate*, excluding charges, declined from 15.5% in third quarter 2021 as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, production curtailment costs and lower volume.Industrial net sales increased 5% versus third quarter 2021 as price (+9%) and volume (+5%) were partially offset by currency (-6%) and the Oil &amp; Gas divestiture (-3%). Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 15%, with growth in the aerospace, automotive and general industrial markets.

The Industrial segment profit rate*, excluding charges, was 11.1%, up 340 basis points versus prior year, as volume growth and price realization were partially offset by commodity inflation and higher supply chain costs.*  Non-GAAP Financial Measure As Further Defined On Page 8** Excludes acquisition sales of $578.9 million and acquisition operating margin of -$0.6 million. Global Cost Reduction Program UpdateThe Company advanced a series of initiatives in the third quarter designed to generate cost savings by resizing the organization and reducing inventory with the ultimate objective of driving long-term growth, improving profitability and generating strong cash flow.  These initiatives are expected to optimize the cost base as well as provide a platform to fund investments to accelerate growth in the core businesses.  The Company remains on track and expects these initiatives to generate cost savings of approximately $150 to $200 million in 2022, $1 billion by the end of 2023 and grow to approximately $2 billion by 2025.During the third quarter, the Company realized $65 million of savings primarily from lower headcount and indirect spend reductions.  In addition, the Company reduced inventory by $290 million sequentially and expects further inventory and working capital reductions in the fourth quarter to support free cash flow generation.*   Non-GAAP Financial Measure As Further Defined On Page 82022 Outlook Corbin Walburger, Interim CFO, commented, ""We have substantially completed our initiatives focused on streamlining the organization and are taking additional measures to adjust our cost base and inventory levels over the next 6 to 9 months.  While the impact of planned production curtailments temporarily increases our manufacturing costs and weighs on margins, we are improving inventory turns and prioritizing cash generation to position the Company for gross margin expansion and balance sheet strength in 2023 and beyond.""The Company is revising its 2022 EPS outlook to $0.10 to $0.80 on a diluted GAAP basis from $0.80 to $2.05, and on a Non-GAAP adjusted basis to $4.15 to $4.65 from $5.00 to $6.00.Free cash flow is expected to be $0.3 to $0.6 billion in the fourth quarter.  Stanley Black &amp; Decker remains focused on disciplined capital allocation, and intends to balance share repurchase activity with its commitment to dividends, debt reduction and strong investment grade credit ratings.Key assumption changes to the Company's prior EPS outlook at the midpoint include:Lower fourth quarter revenue, primarily driven by Europe (-$0.30)Currency translation (-$0.23)Higher production curtailment and destocking costs (-$0.82)Tax impact from lower earnings (+$0.25)These assumptions imply a muted second half adjusted net income due to turning high-cost inventory and the cost implications of planned production curtailments, however this is a strategic choice as we prioritize cashflow generation through inventory reductions.The difference between 2022 GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance is $3.85 to $4.05, consisting of acquisition-related and other charges. These forecasted charges primarily relate to restructuring expenses, a voluntary retirement program, the Russia business closure, integration-related costs, non-cash impairment charge for Oil &amp; Gas, and non-cash inventory step-up charges.*   Non-GAAP Financial Measure As Further Defined On Page 8Acquisition-Related And Other ChargesTotal pre-tax acquisition-related and other charges in the third quarter of 2022 were $118.7 million, primarily related to restructuring expenses and integration-related costs. Gross profit included a net benefit of $2.5 million while SG&amp;A included $41.3 million of these charges. Other, net and Restructuring included $2.7 million and $68.6 million of these charges, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized a $8.6 million pre-tax loss on the sale of the Oil &amp; Gas business.*   Non-GAAP Financial Measure As Further Defined On Page 8Earnings WebcastThe Company will host a webcast with investors today, October 27, 2022, at 8:00 am ET.  A slide presentation, which will accompany the call, will be available at www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors and will remain available after the call.The call will be available through a live, listen-only webcast or teleconference.  Links to access the webcast, register for the teleconference, and view the accompanying slide presentation will be available on the ""Investors"" section of Stanley Black &amp; Decker's website, www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors under the subheading ""News &amp; Events.""  A replay will also be available two hours after the call and can be accessed on the ""Investors"" section of Stanley Black &amp; Decker's website.About Stanley Black &amp; Decker Headquartered in the USA, Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE: SWK) is the world's largest tool company operating manufacturing facilities worldwide.

(PRNewsFoto/Stanley Black &amp; Decker) (PRNewsfoto/Stanley Black &amp; Decker)Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresOrganic sales growth, or organic growth, is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts divided by prior year sales. Operating profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating margin is operating profit as a percentage of sales. Operating profit and operating margin are shown both inclusive and exclusive of acquisition-related and other charges. Management uses operating profit and operating margin as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level. Diluted EPS, excluding charges, or adjusted EPS, is diluted GAAP EPS excluding the impacts of acquisition-related and other charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners, and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common and preferred stock and business acquisitions, among other items.  Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 13 through 16. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results, business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of acquisition-related and other charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995This document contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The reported figure matches the lower end of the adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 43-45 cents. The quarter’s adjustments included certain amortization expenses, intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestitures-related net charges, and restructuring charges among others.Reported EPS in the third quarter was 12 cents, a 57.1% drop from the year-ago quarter’s 28 cents per share.Revenues of $3.17 billion in the third quarter improved 8.1% year over year on a reported basis and 13.7% on an operational basis (at constant exchange rate or CER). Revenues grew 11.5% on an organic basis (adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations and certain recent acquisitions and divestments). The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%. The quarter’s top-line performance also exceeded the company’s projection of organic revenue growth of approximately 8-10%.Q3 Revenues in DetailIn the third quarter, revenues rose 12% in the United States on a reported basis (same operationally). Revenues were down 0.8% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region (up 15.2%) but rose 2.8% in the Asia Pacific zone (up 15.3%). Revenues increased 20.4% in Latin America and Canada (up 24.2%) and 28.1% in emerging markets (up 40%).Segmental AnalysisBoston Scientific recently reorganized its operational structure and aggregated its core businesses, each of which generates revenues from the sale of Medical Devices, into two reportable segments, MedSurg and Cardiovascular.The company generates maximum revenues from Cardiovascular. Sales from its sub-segments, Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions were $1.48 billion (up 12.8% year over year organically) and $479 million (up 12%), respectively, in the third quarter.Story continuesBoston Scientific Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteWithin MedSurg, Endoscopy generated revenues of $559 million, up 10.4% organically. Urology and Pelvic Health revenues were $433 million, reflecting organic growth of 12.6%. Neuromodulation within MedSurg reported $221 million in revenues, reflecting a 3.2% rise organically year over year.MarginsGross margin in the third quarter contracted 19 basis points (bps) year over year to 69.1%. There was an 8.8% rise in the cost of products sold to $979 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 6.2% to $1.13 billion. Research and development expenses rose 9.4% to $339 million. Royalty expenses of $11 million declined 21.4% year over year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 47 bps to 22.4% in the reported quarter.2022 GuidanceBoston Scientific updated full-year 2022 guidance and also provided guidance for the fourth quarter.Full-year net sales growth expectation has been narrowed to 6.5% (previously 6.5-7.5%) on a reported basis. However, net sales growth is now expected at 9% (previously 8-9%) on an organic basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $12.71 billion, indicating a 6.9% rise from the 2021 reported figure. The lower end of the full-year adjusted EPS was reduced to $1.71 to $1.74 ($1.74 to $1.77 expected previously). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 remains above the guided range.For the fourth quarter of 2022, revenue growth is projected in the range of approximately 2-4% on a reported basis (an increase of 7-9% organically). Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of 45-48 cents per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings and revenues is pegged at 48 cents and $3.31 billion, respectively.Our TakeBoston Scientific third quarter of 2022 adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same.  The company registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues.Organic revenues at each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter. However, mounting costs and expenses put pressure on the company’s margins.The updated 2022 guidance seems lackluster, indicating the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderBoston Scientific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the medical sector include Chimerix CMRX, McKesson MCK and Humana HUM.Chimerix currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.9%.The fiscal second-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $156.9 million.Segment DetailsNextGen generates revenues from two sources, namely Recurring revenues, and Software, hardware and other non-recurring revenues.Total Recurring revenues were $143.5 million, up 5.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure, driven by solid performances by NextGen’s transactional and data services, and managed services, especially patient pay and managed cloud services offering.This figure compares to our Recurring revenues’ fiscal Q2 projection of $142.2 million.Subscription services revenues in the fiscal second quarter amounted to $43.4 million, up 5.5% from the prior-year period’s level.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at 95 cents.Our TakeNextGen exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. The solid uptick in the top line, along with strength in both revenue sources, is impressive. Robust increases in Subscription services, Managed services, and Transactional and data services revenues in the quarter are encouraging. The solid improvement in Other non-recurring services revenues is also promising. Lower operating costs led to the expansion in adjusted operating margin during the quarter, which bodes well for the stock. An upbeat guidance for fiscal 2023 also buoys optimism.However, NextGen’s year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS and lower Support and maintenance revenues, and Software license and hardware revenues are disappointing. The contraction of adjusted gross margin also does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Key PicksNextGen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are some medical stocks with the right combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), or #3 which are expected to post an earnings beat this quarter.McKesson Corporation MCK has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

363,cb15b23c-e211-3034-9d6d-99e12b9dcfa0,MCK,2022-10-27,Catalent (CTLT) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/catalent-ctlt-report-q1-earnings-141402698.html,1666793642,STORY,"['CTLT', 'MCK', 'NVRO']","[Catalent, Inc. CTLT is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 1, before market open.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.19 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.5%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, delivering an earnings surprise of 7.2%, on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement:Factors to NoteBiologics BusinessPer Catalent’s fiscal 2022 fourth-quarter earnings update in August, its Biologics segment has been witnessing strength over the past few months on the back of a broad base of service offerings within its biologics segment. This includes the increased demand for Catalent’s customer prescription products and a rebound in demand for its consumer products. The increased demand in Catalent’s cell and gene therapy, drug product and drug substance offerings, which has been registered over the past few months, is likely to have continued in the fiscal 2023 first quarter, thereby driving up the quarterly revenues.However, lower revenues from its COVID-19-related programs over the past few months are likely to have weighed on Catalent’s fiscal first-quarter revenues.During the fiscal 2022 fourth-quarter earnings call, the company confirmed that it has been benefiting from factors like its new drug substance lines in Madison and drug product lines in Bloomington in Europe and its cell therapy and plasmid offerings in Europe and the United States. This is also expected to be an important top-line driver in the fiscal 2023 first quarter.Catalent, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCatalent, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCatalent, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Catalent, Inc. QuoteCatalent is likely to have benefited from its European drug product space, courtesy of its facility in Limoges, France, which it completed in March. The project completion was expected to convert the site into a European center of excellence for biopharmaceutical development, drug product fill/finish services and packaging. This is also likely to have driven its fiscal first-quarter revenues.Story continuesCatalent is also expected to have derived benefits from its UpTempo Virtuoso platform process (introduced in May), which is likely to have significantly driven its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Catalent is also likely to have continued to benefit from robust contributions by its commercial-scale viral vector manufacturing suites, as well as by associated support facilities and services at its gene therapy campus in Harmans, MD. The company’s segmental revenues are also likely to be aided by its high-speed syringe filling line. These developments are likely to have contributed to segmental revenues of the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter Biologics revenues is pegged at $532 million, suggesting a decline of 2.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Pharma and Consumer HealthIn September, Catalent had announced a $2.2 million expansion to its clinical supply facility in Singapore. The investment is expected to increase the site’s footprint and allow the installation of 35 new freezers for ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage. The expansion will likely add specialized secondary packaging capabilities for ULT products, thereby improving its operational efficiencies.The same month, Catalent signed a drug development agreement with Awakn Life Sciences Corp. to optimize the development, launch and supply of better patient treatments across multiple modalities.Catalent, in August, announced that it will be acquiring Metrics Contract Services, a full-service specialty Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization from Mayne Pharma Group Limited. In July, Catalent entered into a manufacturing agreement with Xenetic Biosciences, Inc. which will include cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) manufacturing for the latter’s recombinant protein, Human DNase I. These developments raise our optimism about the stock.Catalent is also likely to have benefited from the expansion of its primary packaging capabilities at its clinical supply facility in Shiga, Japan (June). The same month, Catalent had entered into a development agreement with MigVax to leverage its proprietary Zydis Bio orally disintegrating tablet technology for delivering the MigVax-101 vaccine.In April, Catalent had announced its completion of a significant expansion of its nasal capabilities at its Morrisville, Research Triangle Park, NC, facility to provide improved services for developing and manufacturing unit and bi-dose nasal spray products. The same month, the company announced its completion of the installation and commissioning of four new high-throughput high-bay cGMP manufacturing suites at its facility in Kansas City, MO. These are likely to have contributed to the segment’s revenue in the to-be-reported quarter.The Estimate PictureFor first-quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $1.06 billion implies an improvement of 3.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents per share, implying a decline of 22.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has higher chances of beating estimates. This is not the case here, as you can see:Earnings ESP: Catalent has an Earnings ESP of +3.74%.

MCK and Humana HUM.3 Top-Ranked Medical Stocks Lapping the S&amp;P 500The Zacks Medical sector has been relatively strong over the last month, climbing nearly 5% vs. the S&amp;P 500's ascent of 4%.Additionally, the sector is currently ranked #2 out of all 16 Zacks sectors, telling us that stocks within have been witnessing favorable earnings estimate revisions.After all, since a sector is nothing more than a group of stocks in a similar business, utilizing the Zacks Sector Rank is the perfect way to see which areas currently look more promising than others. For those looking to tap into the relative strength, three top-ranked stocks – Elevance Health, McKesson Corp. and Humana– could all be considered.Let's take a deeper dive into each one.McKesson Corp. McKesson Corp. is a healthcare services and information technology company operating through two segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).MCK has a strong earnings track record, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in nine of its last ten quarters. Revenue results have also consistently been better than expected, with MCK chaining together five consecutive top-line beats.Further, the company rewards its shareholders with a small dividend; MCK's annual dividend yields 0.6% paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at just 8% of earnings.The company has upped its dividend five times over the last five years, translating to a respectable 7.8% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.McKesson has witnessed favorable growth trends as well – in its latest quarter, revenue from its U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions (80% of net revenues in FY22) came in at $56.9 billion, reflecting a 14% Y/Y uptick and easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $52.7 billion.Story continuesHumana Humana is a health care plan provider in the United States, providing health insurance benefits under Health Maintenance Organization, Private Fee-For-Service, and Preferred Provider Organization plans.Humana's earnings outlook has turned bright over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company carries a favorable growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 21% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 12% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 12% and 9% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.Like MCK, Humana pays a small dividend; HUM's annual dividend yield comes in at 0.6%, visibly lower than its Zacks Medical sector average.Still, the company's 23.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack.The company's retail segment (66% of FY21 revenue) raked in $20.9 billion in its latest quarter, good enough for a 13% Y/Y uptick and to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.4 billion by 2%.Elevance HealthElevance Health Inc. operates as a health benefits company, supporting consumers, families, and communities across the entire care journey to lead healthier lives.ELV has found success as of late within its earnings releases, exceeding both top and bottom-line estimates in back-to-back quarters. In its latest print, the company registered a 6% EPS beat paired with a 1.3% revenue beat.Elevance Health is forecasted to grow at a solid pace – earnings are forecasted to climb 11% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 13% in FY23.ELV's Government Business segment (roughly 53% of FY21 revenue) grew 15% Y/Y and raked in $23.8 billion in its latest quarter thanks to the rise in Medicaid membership and higher premium rates of Medicare.Bottom LineThe Zacks Medical sector has been relatively strong over the last month, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 modestly. Currently, it ranks #2 out of all 16 Zacks sectors.By focusing on companies in a highly-ranked Zacks sector, we can easily find groups of stocks with a brighter near-term earnings outlook than others.All three stocks above reside in the sector and carry a favorable Zacks Rank, undoubtedly a rock-solid pairing.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

365,a7259b94-f773-383b-b775-90a446c32798,APD,2022-10-27,Shortage in Helium Could Send These 2 Gas Stocks Higher,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-gas-stocks-play-211128196.html,1666818688,STORY,['APD'],"[Let’s talk about industrial gas. It’s a big business, because gasses are vital to myriad of industrial and medical applications. While some gasses are common and easy to produce – nitrogen, for example, makes up almost 80% of the air we breathe – others are rare. And helium, which in some applications is irreplaceable, is not only rare but also non-renewable. It’s found in deep mines, trapped by nonporous rock, where it was formed long ago through radioactive decay of other elements.As for uses, helium is vital to the functioning of MRI machines, as in its liquid state it is the only element cold enough to allow MRI superconducting electromagnets to function properly. It is also used in deep sea diving breathing mixtures, as an inert atmosphere in arc welding, and as a lifting agent for meteorological balloons. Its medical use in MRIs, however, takes up almost one-third of the global supply, making hospitals the largest consumers of helium.All of this makes helium worth far more than its weight in gold – and that worth is getting pushed higher by a global shortage of the gas. In the US, which produces more than half the world supply, a leak at a Texas helium plant forced a shutdown. At the same time, Russia’s plans to enter the helium market in large way have been derailed by a facility fire that has pushed back planned production at the Amur plant by at least a year, and the Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted trade, making Russian helium doubtful in any case.The upshot is, that investors have a chance now to break into industrial gas stocks, especially in firms that are equipped to handle helium storage and distribution. We’ve pulled the details on two of these companies from the TipRanks platform; here they are, along with analyst commentary on their prospects.Linde plc (LIN)We’ll start with Linde, the largest company in the global industrial gas niche. Linde traces its roots to Germany, and has been in business for almost a century and a half. Today the firm boasts a $143 billion market cap and is the leading provider of atmospheric gasses such as argon, nitrogen, and oxygen, along with volatiles like hydrogen. Linde can provide gasses in pure or mixed forms, and offers engineering expertise in pressurizing or liquifying gasses.Story continuesIn addition to the more common industrial gasses, Linde also offers a reliable supply network for helium. Sourcing its helium from several geographical locations, including Kansas, Qatar, and Australia, and operating more than 50 transfill facilities around the world, Linde can provide helium to customers anywhere, at any time. The company offers a variety of helium transport, delivery, and storage options, including insulated ISO containers, dewars, multi-cylinder packs, regular gas cylinders, and portable cylinders.All in all, industrial gas is more than hot air – it’s big business. Linde had annual revenues of $31 billion in 2021, and both revenues and earnings have been rising this year. The company is scheduled to release its 3Q22 results tomorrow – but in 1H22, Linde’s total revenues of $16.67 billion were up 12.4% from 1H21. Earnings in 2Q22 came in at $3.10 per share, for a 15% year-over-year gain.Covering Linde for Wells Fargo, 5-star analyst Michael Sison is impressed by the company’s ability to thrive even in today’s difficult macroeconomic conditions.“We believe the company provides investors with a way to invest in defensive growth, as LIN has an unparalleled track record of delivering consistent earnings growth even through economic slowdowns. While near-term uncertainty in Europe and China remain concerns, LIN's volumes have remained resilient so far in 2022. Additionally, LIN has proven its ability to mitigate rampant inflation by passing on energy costs, expanding margins, and lifting its ROC to a record in 2Q22,"" Sison noted.""We continue to view LIN as a winner in the decarbonization shift, with a pipeline of +250 potential projects being evaluated to drive the next leg of growth.” the analyst summed up.Following from his belief in Linde’s strong defensive attributes, Sison rates the stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $370 implies a 25% one-year upside potential for the shares. (To watch Sison’s track record, click here)Overall, Linde gets a Strong Buy rating from the Wall Street analyst consensus, based on 19 recent reviews that include 17 Buys, 1Hold, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently trading for $294.84 and their $339.65 average price target suggests ~15% upside in the coming months. (See LIN stock forecast on TipRanks)Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APD)The next stock we’ll look at is one of Linde’s competitors, Air Products and Chemicals. APD is another major provider of industrial gasses, especially volatiles such as hydrogen, in which it has recently made a half-billion dollar investment in New York State. The company is also known as an important supplier of the air gasses, nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. APD has been in business for over 80 years, operates in more than 50 countries for over 170 thousand customers, and sees approximately $10 billion in annual revenues.In addition to its air and hydrogen businesses, APD is also knows as an important helium supplier. The company offers helium as a pure gas, at normal pressure, and can also offer it in compressed or even liquified forms. APD has a global network of storage and transfill facilities, allowing it to meet helium orders worldwide with a minimum of loss – an important selling point when dealing in a non-renewable substance.APD has been reporting steadily increasing revenues for the past two years, and earnings, while not growing as steadily, are also up in that time. In the most recently reported quarter, fiscal 3Q22, the company showed a top line of $3.2 billion, for a 23% year-over-year gain. Adjusted EPS, at $2.62, came in 11% above the year-ago value. In Q3, both the top and bottom lines were the highest in the last two years.This company has a strong defensive nature, as much of its business is conducted under long-term contracts that will ensure payment for product and a steady bottom-line profit. This is a key point for Seaport’s 5-star analyst Michael Harrison.“We believe the industrial gas business has impressive built-in growth potential related to the energy transition (including hydrogen and carbon capture), and note APD has ~ $2.3B in new projects coming on stream in FY23, which we believe can drive bottom-line growth even if industrial production slows. More than half of sales are under long-term take-or-pay contracts with built-in pass-throughs that reduce variable cost risk, and we expect these to hold up even in the case of energy rationing in Europe, noting EMEA hydrogen only accounts for 2% of total APD sales,"" Harrison opined.In staking out this position, Harrison rates APD shares a Buy, with a $300 price target that suggests a 19% one-year upside potential. (To watch Harrison’s track record, click here)There are 11 recent analyst reviews on file for APD, and they include 7 Buys and 4 Holds to give the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are trading for $252.02 and have an average price target of $284.55, indicating a potential gain of ~13%.

369,2740867c-9cce-39f9-abb7-dac0b2470c6c,CHRW,2022-10-27,C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-worldwide-chrw-140202420.html,1666792922,STORY,['CHRW'],"[C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis trucking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.8%.Revenues are expected to be $6.38 billion, up 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.54% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for C.H. Robinson?For C.H. Robinson, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.78%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that C.H. Robinson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that C.H. Robinson would post earnings of $1.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.67, delivering a surprise of +38.34%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.C.H. Robinson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

370,31738500-79a2-39a9-9888-f8fe75d5c4f2,CMI,2022-10-27,Why Cummins (CMI) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-cummins-cmi-great-dividend-154503150.html,1666799103,STORY,['CMI'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Cummins in FocusCummins (CMI) is headquartered in Columbus, and is in the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The stock has seen a price change of 7.58% since the start of the year. The engine maker is paying out a dividend of $1.57 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.68% compared to the Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry's yield of 2.21% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6.28 is up 12.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Cummins has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.86%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Cummins's payout ratio is 38%, which means it paid out 38% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for CMI for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $17.37 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 18.40%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, CMI presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

371,1146646e-6088-314f-a662-18253dc411b8,CMI,2022-10-27,Jim Cramer Gives These 2 Stocks His Stamp of Approval,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-gives-2-stocks-142909399.html,1666794549,STORY,"['CMI', 'STT']","[Markets are rewriting the same story we’ve been looking at all summer – investors are skittish, and wary of the headwinds. Those headwinds are enough to spook even the most experienced traders. High inflation is making everyone nervous, the Fed’s turn to higher interest rates – to combat inflation – brings with it the risk of recession, and macro data on the economy is starting to show declines in the housing markets and consumer confidence and spending. As if all that wasn’t enough, now add in the national election coming up on November 8, and it’s a recipe for trouble.But as usual, with trouble comes opportunity. Jim Cramer, the well-known host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money’ program, has never been one to shy away from a turbulent market, and he has a knack for finding solid stocks that can support an investment portfolio pending better times down the road. Right now, Cramer sees the trading world in something of a holding pattern, saying, “The market needs time to adjust, and the Fed doesn’t want to rock the boat too aggressively right before the election.”Cramer is well-known for the ‘lightning round’ feature on his program, where he gives his short takes to callers’ stock questions. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up the details on a couple of his recent bullish calls. Let’s take a look at the data and the analyst commentary, and find out why Cramer thinks lightning will strike.State Street Corporation (STT)Boston-based State Street makes a unique boast: it is the second-oldest bank in the United States, tracing its roots back to 1792. Today, with $3.3 trillion in total assets under management, along with $35.7 trillion in assets under custody, the company is also one of the largest asset managers on the global scene. State Street reported $11.16 billion in revenues last year, and is well on its way to beating that total this year.On October 18, the company reported its results for 3Q22, showing $2.96 billion at the top line, along with net income of $690 million. STT’s diluted EPS came in at $1.80. State Street reported decreases in its overall fee revenues, including servicing fees and management fees; these were partly offset by increases in fees for forex trading, securities finance, and software and processing. Net interest income was up 36%. These results were considered mostly in-line with expectations.Story continuesThat performance is holding up a dividend of 63 cents per common share. At an annualized rate of $2.52, the dividend is yielding 3.47%.Looking at State Street’s financial performance compared to its share price – the latter is down 20% so far this year – Jim Cramer says of STT: “I think State Street down here at this level is a terrific buy.”5-star analyst Stephen Biggar, covering State Street from Argus, agrees that the stock is one to buy. Laying out the case, he writes, “We expect State Street to benefit from several long-term earnings drivers. First, asset managers are facing cost pressures that will likely lead to the further outsourcing of back-office operations. Second, the company has scale advantages, and should see improved operating leverage over time. Third, asset managers must focus on their core competency (managing money) and not on more-mundane servicing tasks...""""We believe that recent weakness provides a favorable entry point for the high-quality STT shares,"" Biggar summed up.Standing squarely in the bull camp, Biggar rates STT a Buy, and his $88 price target suggests an upside of ~21% over the coming year. (To watch Biggar’s track record, click here)It would seem that, for the most part, Wall Street is in agreement with both Biggar and Cramer. The 10 recent analyst reviews include 7 Buys and 3 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating, and the $79.60 average price target implies ~10% gain from the current trading price of $72.48. (See STT stock forecast on TipRanks)Cummins, Inc. (CMI)The second stock we’ll look at is Cummins, a major name in engineering, best known as a supplier of engines and ancillary components for heavy industrial vehicles. Cummins operates through several segments, offering engines, engine and drive train components, and power generation systems. The company has a global presence, with over 9,000 locations worldwide, and offers full mechanical and maintenance support to its customers.A few numbers will give the scale of Cummins’ ops. The company has more than 58,000 employees, and its revenues are in the tens of billions. The top line hit $19.8 billion in 2020, and in 2021 that rose to $24 billion. So far this year, Cummins has reported results for Q1 and Q2; its first half revenue is up 6.3% from 1H21.Digging into the Q2 report, we find that Cummins had earnings of $702 million, with a diluted EPS of $4.94. International revenues slipped 2% in Q2, but that was more than compensated by North American revenues, which grew 15%. Overall, Cummins reported a top line of $6.6 billion for the quarter. This was up 8% year-over-year, and was in-line with the company’s overall forward guidance; Cummins is expecting a full-year revenue gain of 8% over 2021.Looking at Cummins, Jim Cramer is impressed by the company’s status as a stalwart of the industrial engineering world, an essential sector of the modern economy. He writes of Cummins, “I think Cummins is a great company. This is the kind of stock that is working right now in this environment. It doesn’t really get hurt much by rates. It’s got superior products [that] it’s selling all over the world. I like Cummins.”Cowen analyst Matt Elkot would agree. The 5-star analyst covers CMI, and looking at the company, ahead of Q3 earnings (November 3), he sees several reasons for optimism going forward.“We are positive on CMI into the print... Chips have gotten a bit more stable, and the company has become a little less worried on the issue... Demand environment remains strong. September truck orders came in a lot higher than expected... Backlogs for medium-duty trucks remain robust, and demand may last longer than demand for heavy-duty trucks,"" Elkot noted.To this end, Elkot gives Cummins an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and backs it with a $267 price target that indicates potential for a 13.5% share growth by the end of next year. (To watch Elkot’s track record, click here)What does the rest of the Street think? Looking at the consensus breakdown, opinions from other analysts are more spread out. The stock has 11 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 5 Buys and 6 Holds for a Moderate Buy consensus view. With an average price target of $249.36 and a trading price of $235.28, Cummins has a one-year potential upside of about 6%.

Remanufacturing will allow the company to use less, use better and use again, while presenting an environmentally friendly option to replace a turbo. Additionally, by salvaging roughly 70% of the turbo's metal by weight, remanufacturing greatly reduces the global impact from mining and refining those metals.Cummins' $27 million investment in the remanufacturing facility will create more than 250 new jobs for the North Charleston community. The new facility will remanufacture used turbochargers that will meet the same specifications as new turbos. Each remanufactured turbo will go through an equivalent validation process to ensure they meet the dependability and performance expectations of Cummins' customers.""Our employees in Charleston are critical to making Cummins Turbo Technologies the world-leader in air handling for commercial vehicles by exhibiting the teamwork and excellence necessary to deliver innovative, reliable turbocharger solutions,"" said Shon Wright, Vice President of Cummins Turbo Technologies. ""Our investment in the Charleston area will help us optimize our footprint and continue to be the top choice of our global customers.""Cummins has had a presence in the Charleston area since the 1990s and opened its existing facility, the Charleston Turbo Plant, in 2006 with a focus on manufacturing first-fit turbochargers for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Today, there are more than 725 employees working there.While in Charleston to open the new remanufacturing facility, Wright presented local community groups with grants as part of the company's journey to dismantle institutional racism through the Cummins Advocating for Racial Equity initiative. Metanoia, a local community organization that invests in neighborhood assets to build leaders, was presented a $1 million Community Development grant to establish quality housing and generate economic development. CommunityWorks and Lowcountry Street Grocery also received grants to support small Black-owned businesses in the Charleston community.Story continues""In Charleston, we have a history of supporting community organizations in the areas of education, environment and equality of opportunity,"" Wright said. ""Cummins' goal is to improve communities where our employees are located, and we are committed to bringing together all of Cummins' capabilities - its people, its balance sheet and the company's philanthropy - to drive racial equity and combat the impact of racism on our employees, communities and economy.""ENDView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: http://cummins.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722388/Remanufacturing-Expansion-in-South-Carolina-To-Serve-Customers-and-Meet-Cummins-Sustainability-Strategy]"

CMI is slated to release third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 03, before the market opens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share and revenues is pegged at $4.87 and $6.96 billion, respectively.For the third quarter, the consensus estimate for CMI’s earnings per share has moved up by 5 cents in the past 30 days. Its bottom-line estimates imply a rise of 34.9% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 16.6%. Over the trailing four quarters, CMI surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions and missed twice, with the average surprise being 1.49%. This is depicted in the graph below:Cummins Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCummins Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCummins Inc. price-eps-surprise | Cummins Inc. QuoteQ2 HighlightsIn second-quarter 2022, CMI’s adjusted earnings per share of $4.77 surpassed the consensus metric of $4.37. Higher-than-expected EBITDA in the Engine, Distribution and Components segments resulted in the outperformance. The bottom line also increased 15% year over year from $4.15 a share. The company reported net sales of $6,586 million, up 7.8% from $6,111 million in the year-ago quarter. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,477 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Cummins for the quarter to be reported, as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. A combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: CMI has an Earnings ESP of -0.16%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 1 cent lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesFactors at PlayCummins, the global leader in engine production, has an impressive product portfolio. Its focus on new and innovative product launches across the third quarter is likely to have boosted its quarterly performance. Also, as the demand for hydrogen energy heightens worldwide, Cummins’ offerings see an increased demand. The company’s efforts to ramp up its capabilities in electrification, fuel cell and hydrogen production technology and strategic partnerships are praiseworthy, which might have aided its growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The increase in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production in North America, Europe and India is likely to have aided its top-line growth in the quarter. Moreover, the acquisition of Meritor gives Cummins a strong footing as it brings forth lucrative growth opportunities across its range of power solutions and applications. It also adds to the company’s efforts toward de-carbonized offerings. These are expected to have provided a boost to the engine maker’s prospects in the third quarter of 2022.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales and EBITDA for most of Cummins’ key segments indicate an improvement over last-year reported numbers.On the flip side, high commodity, labor and logistics costs are likely to have clipped margins. Also, a boost to its capabilities in fuel cell and hydrogen production technology has made R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses spiral and are expected to have acted as spoilsports. Additionally, the company’s New Power segment is suffering from continuous losses amid high product and technology-related expenses for the past several quarters. The trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, hurting margins.Here’s a briefing of revenue and EBITDA estimates for Cummins’ segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly sales for the Engine segment is pegged at $2,824 million, suggesting an increase from the year-ago quarter’s $2,578 million.

383,24c0f6f3-176a-3e1d-bfef-6d5c8ea9c775,UA,2022-10-27,Slowing Rates Of Return At Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) Leave Little Room For Excitement,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slowing-rates-return-under-armour-174451320.html,1666806291,STORY,['UAA'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Under Armour:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$525m ÷ (US$5.0b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).Thus, Under Armour has an ROCE of 15%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Under Armour roceIn the above chart we have measured Under Armour's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Under Armour's ROCE Trend?Over the past five years, Under Armour's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Under Armour doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.Another point to note, we noticed the company has increased current liabilities over the last five years. This is intriguing because if current liabilities hadn't increased to 29% of total assets, this reported ROCE would probably be less than15% because total capital employed would be higher.The 15% ROCE could be even lower if current liabilities weren't 29% of total assets, because the the formula would show a larger base of total capital employed. So while current liabilities isn't high right now, keep an eye out in case it increases further, because this can introduce some elements of risk.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, Under Armour isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Since the stock has declined 41% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.If you're still interested in Under Armour it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The mean price target of $202.08 indicates a 31.7% upside potential.The mean estimate comprises 13 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $37.85. While the lowest estimate of $170 indicates a 10.8% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 97.4% to reach $303. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in FFIV. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for FFIVHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why FFIV Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month, as two estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, FFIV currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much FFIV could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.5 billion, which indicates a rise of 1.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at 74 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 8.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days.We expect the company’s third-quarter net sales to increase 2.5% year over year to $4,523.4 million and the bottom line to decline 7.9% to 75 cents per share.In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings beat of 1.4%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 0.99%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.ColgatePalmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise ColgatePalmolive Company Price and EPS SurpriseColgatePalmolive Company price-eps-surprise | ColgatePalmolive Company QuoteKey Aspects to NoteThe leading global consumer products company is expected to have gained from consumer demand for personal care, hygiene and home care products. Colgate has been driving growth via product innovation, in-store implementation and expansion plans. Increased focus on premiumization and digital transformation also bodes well. These are likely to have aided the third-quarter 2022 performance.Colgate’s top-line performance is expected to have benefited from brand strength and increased product pricing across all regions to combat rising costs.The company has been focusing on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Its premium innovation products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, have been performing well. This is expected to have boosted organic sales growth for its oral care business in the third quarter. We anticipate organic sales growth of 7.7% for the third quarter.Expanding product availability through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels is one of Colgate’s priorities to improve organic sales. The company has been aggressively expanding into faster growth channels, while extending the geographic footprint of its brands. Colgate has also been focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel, as more consumers have been using online services for their essential needs. Gains from the company’s expansion efforts are likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results.Colgate’s Hill's business has been witnessing momentum, which is expected to have delivered sales growth in the third quarter. Strength in Hill's Prescription Diet and Hill's Science Diet has been aiding sales for the segment. The company’s newly launched Prescription Diet Derm Complete has been gaining market share. This is expected to have boosted sales in the third quarter. For the third quarter, we expect 8.2% revenue growth for the Hill's business.However, higher raw material and logistic costs worldwide have been concerning despite sales growth. Each of the company’s segments has been incurring significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. Higher logistics costs have been resulting from volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry, higher e-commerce demand, and the impact of the Ukraine war. These headwinds are likely to have continued to impact the third-quarter performance.Moreover, the company has been witnessing a deleverage in advertising and SG&amp;A expenses, which have been weighing on margins. These costs and headwinds are likely to have hurt the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect third-quarter GAAP SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, to deleverage 20 basis points to 36.9%. As a result, we anticipate a GAAP operating margin contraction of 200 basis points to 19.9%.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Colgate this time around.

However, we decided to pay close attention to its weak financials as we are doubtful that the current momentum will keep up, given the scenario. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Juniper Networks'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Juniper Networks How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Juniper Networks is:9.8% = US$424m ÷ US$4.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Juniper Networks' Earnings Growth And 9.8% ROEAt first glance, Juniper Networks' ROE doesn't look very promising. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 10%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Having said that, Juniper Networks' five year net income decline rate was 6.5%. Remember, the company's ROE is a bit low to begin with. Hence, this goes some way in explaining the shrinking earnings.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Juniper Networks' performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 17% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for JNPR? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Juniper Networks Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Juniper Networks has a high three-year median payout ratio of 77% (that is, it is retaining 23% of its profits). This suggests that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This goes some way in explaining why its earnings have been shrinking. With only very little left to reinvest into the business, growth in earnings is far from likely.Moreover, Juniper Networks has been paying dividends for eight years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer consistent dividends even though earnings have been shrinking. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 16% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, Juniper Networks' performance is quite a big let-down. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Juniper Networks' CEO Rami Rahim joining us now. Rami, good to see you, sir. What did we learn in the quarter?RAMI RAHIM: Well, it was a great quarter. We had record revenue for the quarter, record enterprise revenue. We had double digit growth rates in all of our strategic verticals, record software, record AR. So I'm delighted with the execution of the team. I think we've got some great technologies out there. It's really working for us.SEANA SMITH: Rami, when we take a look over the next couple of quarters, obviously, we're in an environment where some businesses are beginning to pull back on spending. Are you seeing that happen at all? And what are you seeing-- are you seeing any orders be canceled yet?RAMI RAHIM: We're seeing some customers scrutinize their budgets a little bit more and the timing of their projects. But by and large, I'm delighted with the order momentum and the demand dynamics that exist in the market today. I think we have seen no cancellations, maybe a few pushouts.I really do believe that we have a very large market opportunity. And we have a very differentiated technology solution about AI-driven operations, AI-driven experience, and the ability to grow share even in an environment where we might see some pullback in spending. But so far, we haven't really seen anything.DAVE BRIGGS: Rami, much ado about the Azure cloud numbers from yesterday. What are you seeing in the cloud space from your own numbers?RAMI RAHIM: So our cloud customers are very important to Juniper Networks. And our cloud business has been performing very well over the last few years. I honestly don't pay too much attention to the results of any given quarter, because generally speaking, cloud providers' business is doing exceptionally well. In the long-term, they will have to continue to invest in their network infrastructure to keep pace with the insatiable demand from consumers and enterprises for cloud services.Story continuesAnd we power many of the cloud networks that are out there. All of the hyperscalers, many of the tier 2, tier 3 cloud providers as well, with great technologies for automation, [INAUDIBLE] technologies that drive capacity requirements for our customers. So I'm delighted with the performance that we're seeing in the cloud space.DAVE BRIGGS: Speaking of performance, we have a three-month chart up right now. But if you take a look at how the stock has fared year to date, clearly outpacing so many of your rivals out there. What do you think Juniper has done to really better position yourself than some of the major competitors? Because you're off 15%, but when you compare that to some of the massive losses that we're seeing within the tech sector, it looks pretty good.RAMI RAHIM: The future of networking is around AI-driven operations. And this is where we have performed exceptionally well. We saw our enterprise business grow double digits, both from an orders and a revenue standpoint. And the magic, the secret sauce here, is our AI capabilities that is crushing the cost of running networks for our customers, as well as vastly improving the end user experience of using those networks to do practically anything today. That differentiation is working for us in the market today better than it has in the history of our company.DAVE BRIGGS: The release cites a worldwide shortage of semiconductors and other components. You also say we're experiencing ongoing supply chain challenges. Can you talk about those challenges? And do you see them improving on the horizon?RAMI RAHIM: We grew revenue in Q3 19% year over year, which means that, roughly speaking, we shipped 19% more volume of products this quarter than we did a year ago. So clearly, things are improving, but they remain challenging. And in fact, we're sitting on a record backlog for the company, which means that there are a lot of customers out there that are waiting for their products to be shipped.I do anticipate things to start to get better. Not completely normal, but better next year. We're obviously working very closely with our strategic suppliers to understand what the dynamics are like. And we've invested in our supply chain to keep pace with or as close as possible with the demand from our customers. That's worked for us in Q3. I expect it to continue to work for us through the rest of this year. And I think it should get better next year.SEANA SMITH: Rami, you mentioned earlier that you haven't really seen a slowdown at least when it comes to some of your customers out there in this weakening economy. But more specifically, what does it mean for your business, for your growth? Because here we are, up against a strong dollar. Rates are rising. How are you adjusting?RAMI RAHIM: So we are, in fact, making sure that we are pivoting our investments to areas of the market that are going to be most resilient to any sort of economic downturn. Even if you don't necessarily see anything just now, we are, in fact, looking at investing in new areas in our go-to-market organization and our technologies that could make us more resilient in the event of that downturn.So for example, public sector, college campuses, healthcare are new areas where our technologies are really, really suited for. We just have to pivot our sales motion, our playbooks in that direction. And I think that sets us up for success, even in the event of a downturn.SEANA SMITH: Rami Rahim is CEO of Juniper Networks. Thanks so much for joining us.]"
393,fb865d9f-4bb1-3a21-98a7-447a6ebe625b,JNPR,2022-10-27,"3 Wireless Stocks Set to Ride on Fiber Densification, 5G Rollout",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-wireless-stocks-set-ride-130501071.html,1666789501,STORY,"['IDCC', 'VSAT', 'JNPR', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry appears well poised to gain from healthy demand trends amid fading supply chain adversities with the gradual revival in post-pandemic market conditions and a faster pace of 5G deployment. However, large-scale investments to support the transition to 5G and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment are likely to erode margins.Nevertheless, Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR, Viasat, Inc. VSAT and InterDigital, Inc. IDCC are likely to benefit in the long run from the increasing demand for state-of-the-art wireless products with a vast proliferation of IoT and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions. The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Fiber Optic Densification &amp; Faster 5G Rollout: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services. Moreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. Expansion of fiber optic networks by carriers to support their 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are likely to act as tailwinds. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment. Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Eroding Profitability: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pricing pressure in early 5G deals. Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays, and shortages of other raw materials are likely to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to affect the delivery schedule and escalate production costs. High technological obsolescence of most products has also escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for EQT Corporation: favorable.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $4.92 billion, up 41.9% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.88 per share and revenue of $19.75 billion. These totals would mark changes of +151.56% and +65.73%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Devon Energy. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $8.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +155.7%.Revenues are expected to be $842 million, up 109.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.68% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chord Energy Corporation?For Chord Energy Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.04%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Chord Energy Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Chord Energy Corporation would post earnings of $7.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.30, delivering a surprise of -6.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Chord Energy Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, Devon Energy (DVN) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +97.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $4.92 billion, up 41.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Devon Energy has been revised 11.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.01%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Devon Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Devon Energy DVN, Kimbell Royalty LP KRP, The Williams Companies, Inc. WMB, Alliance Resource Partners ARLP.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Energy Stocks to Grab TodayThe energy markets are in a state of upheaval, a situation that's unlikely to reverse until there's some sort of a conclusion to the war in Ukraine, or at least until Europe has more energy. This is unlikely to happen any time soon, despite the nuclear fuel that everybody seems to be buying from Russia because it's not under sanction, and despite the fact that fears of a global recession are beating down oil prices.In the Winter Fuels Outlook released in October 2022, the EIA said, ""Compared with last winter, in nominal terms, we forecast expenditures for homes that heat with natural gas will rise by 28%, heating oil by 27%, electricity by 10%, and propane 5% from October–March."" Colder temperatures and higher fuel costs will contribute to this (It expects Brent to average $93 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $95 per barrel in 2023).U.S. gasoline consumption in 2022 will decline 40,000 b/d from 2021 and stay near that level in 2023, as rising fuel efficiency offsets transportation demand.The EIA maintains that natural gas inventories will end the April-October injection season 6% below the 2017-2021 average.Demand is therefore expected to remain quite high and supply relatively limited, which is what we are also hearing from the street, as the U.S. remains capacity constrained at refiners while new investment remains low as greener fuels weaken the long-term outlook.While practically the entire sector is worth buying today, the refiners are the ones seeing a lot of growth and margin expansion, which also means that they're not necessarily the best income generators. But if you look further, you could find stocks with strong growth prospects that are also paying a handsome dividend:Story continuesDevon EnergyThe U.S.-based E&amp;P company is seeing solid growth in revenue and profits. This year alone, it's expected to grow revenue 67% and earnings 152%. 2023 growth rates are slower at a respective 2% and 9%. Estimates for this company have been coming down, but things could change after it reports on Oct 31.Especially because the Zacks model shows that a buy-ranked stock with a positive earnings ESP (expected surprise prediction) usually does better than expected. In this case, we have a #2 (Buy) ranked stock with an ESP of 0.29%. So let's see what it does.In the meantime, it's worth pointing out that Devon pays a very nice dividend that yields 8.35%.The shares also trade at a discount to their median level over the past year in terms of price to earnings (P/E). So they're cheap.Kimbell Royalty LPKimbell Royalty Partners, which owns and acquires mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties is expected to grow revenue and earnings by a respective 93% and 155% in 2022. Revenues are currently expected to decline around 3% next year although earnings will still expand 25%.The 2022 estimate is down a penny in the last 30 days, but this is still much higher than 60 days ago. The 2023 estimate remains unchanged. Therefore, it should be considered as more of a fine-tuning than an actual downward revision.The fact that the ESP is a positive 20.64% is additional evidence that the revisions trend is not negative. The ESP captures the difference between the most recent estimate and the average estimate, going by the logic that the latest estimate is more accurate, having considered the most recent factors affecting the company. When coupled with Kimbell Royalty's #2 rank, we also know that the stock has a fair chance of beating estimates when it reports on Nov 3.In addition, the company pays a dividend that yields 11.77%.The shares also trade at a 40% discount to their median levels over the past year. So they're definitely worth jumping into.The Williams Companies, Inc.A premier energy infrastructure provider in North America, The Williams Companies is expected to grow its revenue by around 1% this year and another 5% in the next. Its earnings are however expected to grow 15% and 14%, respectively. Estimates are moving higher on this company, both for 2022 and 2023. Since it doesn't report until Oct 31, we'll have to see if the positive revisions trend continues.It is however encouraging to note that the ESP for WMB is 1.53%, which along with its Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) rank, is indicative of a positive earnings surprise.Its dividend yields 5.39%.At 17.8X P/E, the shares also trade at a 22% discount to their median level over the past year, which makes them relatively cheap.Alliance Resource PartnersZacks #2 ranked Alliance Resource Partners is a diversified producer and marketer of coal to major U.S. utilities and industrial users.The oil crunch has increased demand for all kinds of energy, from the cleanest to the dirtiest, which is why there is increased demand for coal. Allied Recourse is a beneficiary of these trends, with expected 2022 revenue and earnings growth of 53% and 227%, respectively. In the following year, revenue is expected to grow 7% and earnings 25%. There are no estimate revisions in the last 60 days but notable improvements in the last 60 days. The #2 rank and 0 ESP are also indicative of a positive surprise when Alliance Resource reports on Oct 31.Its dividend yields 7.03%.Valuation is also cheap.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021. Amazingly, they soared +40.3%, +48.2%, +67.6%, +94.4%, and +95.3%.

409,a31b9ea2-9243-3029-a8c3-0d3d7aaf33a3,URI,2022-10-27,United Rentals (URI) Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-uri-beats-q3-213509581.html,1666820109,STORY,['URI'],"[United Rentals (URI) came out with quarterly earnings of $9.27 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9 per share. This compares to earnings of $6.58 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this equipment rental company would post earnings of $6.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.86, delivering a surprise of 19.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.United Rentals , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $3.05 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.22%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.6 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.United Rentals shares have lost about 11.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for United Rentals?While United Rentals has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for United Rentals: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $9.44 on $3.22 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $31.89 on $11.61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Building Products - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 30% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Installed Building Products (IBP), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.This residential insulation installer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +55.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Installed Building Products' revenues are expected to be $673.95 million, up 32.2% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

410,d420d0ed-76dd-377c-99d2-bbb3a227cf3a,URI,2022-10-27,United Rentals Announces Record Third Quarter Results,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-announces-record-third-201500789.html,1666815300,STORY,['URI'],"[Raises 2022 Guidance for Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA1 and Capital Spending, Announces New $1.25 Billion Share Repurchase ProgramSTAMFORD, Conn., October 26, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2022 and raised its full-year guidance for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and gross and net rental capital spending.Third Quarter 2022 HighlightsTotal revenue of $3.051 billion, including rental revenue2 of $2.732 billion.Fleet productivity3 increased 8.9% year-over-year.Net income of $606 million, at a margin4 of 19.9%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.66, and adjusted EPS1 of $9.27.Adjusted EBITDA of $1.521 billion, at a margin4 of 49.9%.Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities of $3.182 billion; free cash flow1 of $1.140 billion, including gross rental capital spending of $2.456 billion.Net leverage ratio5 of 1.9x, with total liquidity5 of $2.843 billion, at September 30, 2022.CEO CommentMatthew Flannery, chief executive officer of United Rentals, said, ""Our strong third quarter results reflect the momentum we’ve sustained throughout this year, and particularly in our busiest season. Once again, our team did an outstanding job meeting customer needs safely and efficiently as we continued to lean into growth. We’re guiding to higher full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as well as an increase in rental capex, based on the sustained demand we see in our end-markets and the strength of our core rental results.""Flannery continued, ""While there are clearly cross-currents in the economy, virtually all key non-residential construction indicators remain encouraging, including customer sentiment. In addition, we see substantial opportunities next year across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. We expect to deliver another year of profitable growth, strong cash flow, and attractive returns for our shareholders.""Story continuesUpdated 2022 OutlookThe company has updated its 2022 outlook as shown below.Current OutlookPrior OutlookTotal revenue$11.5 billion to $11.7 billion$11.4 billion to $11.7 billionAdjusted EBITDA6$5.5 billion to $5.6 billion$5.4 billion to $5.55 billionNet rental capital expenditures after gross purchases$2.25 billion to $2.45 billion, after gross purchases of $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion$1.85 billion to $2.05 billion, after gross purchases of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billionNet cash provided by operating activities$4.05 billion to $4.4 billion$3.85 billion to $4.25 billionFree cash flow (excluding the impact of merger and restructuring related payments)$1.6 billion to $1.8 billion$1.85 billion to $2.05 billionSummary of Third Quarter 2022 Financial ResultsRental revenue for the quarter was $2.732 billion, reflecting an increase of 20.0% year-over-year, and establishing a third quarter record. The increase reflects the broad-based strength of demand across the end-markets served by the company. Year-over-year, fleet productivity increased 8.9% while average original equipment at cost (""OEC"") increased 10.6%.Used equipment sales in the quarter decreased 1.1% year-over-year. These sales generated $181 million of proceeds at a GAAP gross margin of 61.9% and an adjusted gross margin7 of 64.6%; this compares with $183 million at a GAAP gross margin of 45.9% and an adjusted gross margin of 50.3% for the same period last year. The gross margin increases were primarily due to higher pricing on used equipment sales.Net income for the quarter increased 48.2% year-over-year to a third quarter record of $606 million, while net income margin increased 410 basis points to 19.9%, which was also a third quarter record. The improvements primarily reflected higher gross margins from rental revenue and used equipment sales, reductions in selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expense and non-rental depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue, and lower net interest expense, which included the impact of $30 million of debt redemption losses in the third quarter of 2021. While these items were partially offset by higher income tax expense as a percentage of revenue, the effective income tax rate of 25.7% was largely flat year-over-year.Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 23.4% year-over-year to a third quarter record of $1.521 billion, while adjusted EBITDA margin increased 240 basis points to 49.9%. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin primarily reflected a 40 basis point increase in rental margin (excluding depreciation), a 14.3 percentage point increase in adjusted gross margin from used equipment sales, reduced SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue and revenue mix benefits.General rentals segment had an 18.7% year-over-year increase in rental revenue to a third quarter record of $1.942 billion. Rental gross margin increased by 130 basis points to 41.0%, primarily due to better fixed cost absorption on higher revenue.Specialty rentals segment rental revenue increased 23.2% year-over-year to a third quarter record of $790 million. Rental gross margin increased by 70 basis points to 52.2%, primarily due to better fixed cost absorption on higher revenue, partially offset by a higher proportion of revenue from certain lower margin ancillary fees in 2022 versus the prior year.Cash flow from operating activities increased 5.3% year-over-year to $3.182 billion for the first nine months of 2022, and free cash flow, including aggregated merger and restructuring payments, decreased 9.1% to $1.140 billion. The decrease in free cash flow was mainly due to higher net rental capital expenditures (purchases of rental equipment less proceeds from sales of rental equipment), which increased $236 million, and increased purchases of non-rental equipment, partially offset by higher net cash from operating activities.Capital management. The company's net leverage ratio was 1.9x at September 30, 2022, as compared to 2.2x at December 31, 2021. Year-to-date through September 30, 2022, the company has executed the following capital management transactions: 1) repurchased $1 billion of common stock, completing the repurchase program that commenced in the first quarter of 2022, 2) redeemed $500 million principal amount of its 5 1/2 percent Senior Notes due 2027, 3) amended and extended its ABL facility, increasing its size by $500 million to $4.25 billion and extending its expiration to June 2027, 4) amended and extended its accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing its size by $200 million to $1.1 billion and extending its expiration to June 2024 and 5) entered into an uncommitted short-term financing facility8 pursuant to which it may borrow up to $100 million.Total liquidity was $2.843 billion as of September 30, 2022, including $76 million of cash and cash equivalents.Return on invested capital (ROIC)9 increased 270 basis points year-over-year, and 70 basis points sequentially, to a record 12.2% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2022. The year-over-year and sequential increases in ROIC were primarily due to increased after-tax operating income.Share Repurchase ProgramOn October 24, 2022, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1.25 billion share repurchase program which is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2022 and be completed by the end of 2023. The new program follows the company’s prior $1.0 billion program that was completed during the third quarter of 2022.Conference CallUnited Rentals will hold a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, October 27, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The conference call number is 800-343-1703 (international: 203-518-9859). The replay number for the call is 402-220-6093. The passcode for both the conference call and replay is 37954. The conference call will also be available live by audio webcast at unitedrentals.com, where it will be archived until the next earnings call.Non-GAAP MeasuresFree cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment and intangible assets. The equipment and intangible asset purchases and proceeds represent cash flows from investing activities. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charges, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charges, the impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charge and loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities. The company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliations would require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company provides a range for its adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. The company provides an adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.About United RentalsUnited Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world.

These statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""seek,"" ""on-track,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend"" or ""anticipate,"" or the negative thereof or comparable terminology, or by discussions of vision, strategy or outlook. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the cyclical nature of our business, which is highly sensitive to North American construction and industrial activities; if construction or industrial activity decline, our revenues and, because many of our costs are fixed, our profitability may be adversely affected; (2) the impact of global economic conditions (including inflation, increased interest rates, supply chain constraints, potential trade wars and sanctions and other measures imposed in response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) and public health crises and epidemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), on us, our customers and our suppliers, in the United States and the rest of the world; (3) uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on global economic conditions, and regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside or become viewed as endemic. Uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and the time it will take for the pandemic to subside will also be impacted by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health; (4) rates we charge and time utilization we achieve being less than anticipated; (5) excess fleet in the equipment rental industry; (6) inability to benefit from government spending, including spending associated with infrastructure projects; (7) trends in oil and natural gas, including significant increases in the prices of oil or natural gas, could adversely affect the demand for our services and products; (8) competition from existing and new competitors; (9) costs we incur being more than anticipated, including as a result of inflation, and the inability to realize expected savings in the amounts or time frames planned; (10) our significant indebtedness, which requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service and can constrain our flexibility in responding to unanticipated or adverse business conditions; (11) the inability to refinance our indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us, including as a result of volatility and uncertainty in capital markets or increases in interest rates, or at all; (12) the incurrence of additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness; (13) noncompliance with financial or other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in our lenders terminating the agreements and requiring us to repay outstanding borrowings; (14) restrictive covenants and amount of borrowings permitted in our debt instruments, which can limit our financial and operational flexibility; (15) inability to access the capital that our businesses or growth plans may require, including as a result of uncertainty in capital or other financial markets; (16) the possibility that companies that we have acquired or may acquire could have undiscovered liabilities or involve other unexpected costs, may strain our management capabilities or may be difficult to integrate; (17) the incurrence of impairment charges; (18) fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated; (19) our charter provisions as well as provisions of certain debt agreements and our significant indebtedness may have the effect of making more difficult or otherwise discouraging, delaying or deterring a takeover or other change of control of us; (20) inability to manage credit risk adequately or to collect on contracts with a large number of customers; (21) turnover in our management team and inability to attract and retain key personnel, as well as loss, absenteeism or the inability of employees to work or perform key functions in light of public health crises or epidemics (including COVID-19); (22) inability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all, as a result of supply chain disruptions, insolvency, financial difficulties or other factors;

Recently, URI broke out above the 50-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.The 50-day simple moving average, which is one of three major moving averages, is widely used by traders and analysts to establish support and resistance levels for a range of securities. Because it's the first sign of an up or down trend, the 50-day is considered to be more important.Over the past four weeks, URI has gained 11.5%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.Once investors consider URI's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 1 higher, and the consensus estimate has increased as well.Investors should think about putting URI on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Both its quarterly revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are likely to have seen year-over-year increases.In the last reported quarter, this self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 1.79% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected an improvement in the realized annual rent per available square foot in the reported quarter. The company benefited from its expansion efforts through acquisitions, developments and extensions.Over the last four quarters, Public Storage surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 3.06%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Public Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage price-eps-surprise | Public Storage QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key FactorsPublic Storage is likely to have gained from its solid presence in key cities and high brand value in the third quarter. PSA is also likely to have benefited from its technological advantage amid favorable market fundamentals and maintained a healthy balance sheet position.In addition, the company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In the June-end quarter, Public Storage acquired 10 self-storage facilities comprising 0.7 million net rentable square feet of area for $123.6 million.Following Jun 30, 2022, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire 24 self-storage facilities spanning 1.7 million net rentable square feet of space across 10 states for $257.4 million. Such acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to have stoked the company’s growth during the period under consideration.Amid these, Public Storage is likely to have seen growth in revenues in the quarter to be reported with healthy rental rates. Also, PSA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with adequate liquidity to bank on expansion opportunities through acquisitions and developments. This is likely to have continued in the third quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1.07 billion, calling for a 19.3% year-over-year increase.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from self-storage facilities stands at $989.7 million. This suggests an increase from the $973.3 million witnessed in the prior quarter and $840.5 million in the year-ago period.Quarterly revenues from ancillary operations are presently projected at $56.9 million, slightly down from the prior-quarter figure of $58.8 million but ahead of the $54.4 million registered in the comparable period last year.PSA’s activities during the quarter under review were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter FFO per share has been revised a cent upward to $4.05 in the past month. It also calls for 18.4% year-over-year growth.However, with the impact of the pandemic abating, vacancy is likely to increase. Furthermore, there is a development boom of self-storage units in several markets. This high supply is likely to have fueled competition.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Public Storage this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.PSA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.34 %.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Public Storage (PSA) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.10 a share six days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 1, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $4.10 Most Accurate Estimate and the $4.05 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Public Storage has an Earnings ESP of 1.34%.PSA is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Bank OZK (OZK).Bank OZK is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on January 19, 2023. OZK's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.34 a share 85 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bank OZK is $1.31, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.68%.Story continuesPSA and OZK's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

416,56b41241-8eda-361e-b9a2-16f1db0545fe,MU,2022-10-27,Micron and Governor Hochul Welcome President Biden to Central New York Marking Milestone Local Community and Workforce Commitments,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-governor-hochul-welcome-president-090000577.html,1666861200,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron Technology, Inc.Community Investment Framework defines Micron’s partnership with Empire State Development, benefiting Central New York and America’s manufacturing leadershipInvestments made possible by the state’s historic Green CHIPS legislation and federal CHIPS and Science ActSYRACUSE, N.Y., Oct. 27, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU), one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies and the only U.S.-based manufacturer of memory, and Governor Kathy Hochul welcome President Joe Biden and other federal, state and local officials to Central New York where Micron plans to invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a leading-edge memory megafab. With the signing of the Community Investment Framework, Micron will mark its initial community and workforce commitments established with Empire State Development (ESD). This framework encompasses the $500 million Green CHIPS Community Investment Fund focused on supporting workforce development, education, community assets and organizations, and affordable housing, as well as other initiatives that ensure the Central New York workforce will have the advanced skills needed to sustain leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing.Micron will invest $250 million in the Fund and an additional $100 million will be invested from New York, with $150 million from local, other state and national partners. The company will also establish a Community Advisory Committee consisting of 11 diverse community members, in addition to representatives from local and state governments as well as Micron. The Committee will identify priorities and prospective areas for investment from the Fund. Through this approach, Micron and ESD aim to better understand and address the needs of the Central New York community and make targeted investments throughout the region. Governor Hochul, Empire State Development CEO Hope Knight and Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra will sign the Community Investment Framework, alongside local partners, endorsing the spirit of collaboration with ESD to invest in the region. Micron’s plans to build a megafab in New York, which will create nearly 50,000 New York jobs including approximately 9,000 high-paying Micron jobs, is the result of the bipartisan work of Congress and the Biden Administration to pass the CHIPS and Science Act.Story continues“We are honored to host President Biden and many prominent leaders today in Central New York, the future site of Micron’s new leading-edge megafab that will fuel U.S. innovation for years to come,” said Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “To secure U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, cultivate American innovation and ensure economic and national security, it is imperative we come together to build and transform a workforce for the future. Our commitments through the Community Investment Framework represent the first foundational steps toward Central New York’s transformation.”“Micron’s historic $100 billion investment secures a bright economic future for generations of New Yorkers in Onondaga County and across the state, and this transformative project cements New York's manufacturing leadership,” Governor Hochul said. “In addition to nearly 50,000 jobs, deep commitments to sustainability, and opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses and disadvantaged communities, this project’s $500 million community fund will sustain the region in the long term with investments in workforce, housing, and infrastructure. I am thrilled that President Biden could join us for this once-in-a-generation announcement, and I look forward to working closely with our local, state, and federal partners, as well as the business and labor communities, to bring one of the largest economic development projects in U.S. history to fruition.”Building the Workforce of the FutureBoth traditional and nontraditional workforce development pathways are critical to train the workforce at the scale necessary for the U.S. semiconductor industry. The workforce of the future will require talented engineers and technicians with diverse skill sets to manage and operate state-of-the-art cleanroom facilities and develop advanced engineering solutions. Micron is committed to effective and creative solutions that expand the workforce and make these careers accessible to all, particularly to individuals in underrepresented and rural communities.In line with Micron’s strategy to partner with leading higher education institutions in the region, Micron and Onondaga County will together invest $10 million, with Micron investing $5 million over 10 years, to build and outfit a cleanroom at Onondaga Community College and support development of the school’s technical curriculum. This investment will provide students access to advanced manufacturing methods and equipment to prepare them for technician and engineering roles inside Micron’s manufacturing facility.Micron will also look to tap Central New York’s significant military population, a highly skilled and talented pool of labor critical to scale U.S. high-tech manufacturing. In coordination and partnership with Micron, Syracuse University’s D’Aniello Institute of Veteran and Military Families (IVMF) will support veteran skill development for advanced manufacturing jobs and transitions into Micron and other industry roles. Micron will also establish an internship program designed to prepare students for full-time positions as engineers, scientists and other critical roles in the semiconductor industry, with recruitment focused heavily on veterans and students from traditionally underrepresented communities. Micron aspires to hire more than 1,500 veterans in the region over two decades in Central New York, aligned with Micron’s goals for veteran hiring.In addition, Micron has entered into a Project Labor Agreement with local trade unions, which establishes a framework for labor-management cooperation and stability throughout the construction of the new megafab. This agreement outlines the use of the Center for Military Recruitment, Assessment and Veterans Employment and its “Helmets to Hardhats” program. It also requires contractors to donate one cent per hour for each craft hour worked on the project to the Pathways for Apprenticeship program, part of Syracuse Build, to promote representation of minorities and women in the project workforce.As part of Micron’s commitment to increase supplier diversity, Micron will work to ensure that 30% of the project’s eligible construction spend, and 20% of its eligible ongoing annual operating spend, is awarded to companies owned by individuals from traditionally underrepresented communities, with priority given to New York State Certified Minority/Women Owned Business Enterprises and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses. Micron will encourage construction contractors and subcontractors to use Syracuse Build as a first-source model to identify candidates for hiring from disadvantaged populations.Investing in STEM Education For All STEM education in K-12 through post-secondary schooling and training programs is essential to create a skilled talent pipeline. Micron will invest in local education programs and empower under-resourced youth to pursue careers in STEM to support building a more diverse and inclusive technology industry at large.As part of Micron’s commitment, the company will invest $10 million over 10 years in the Syracuse STEAM school — the first collaborative school in the area designed to integrate the areas of science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics — as well as other K-12 programs in the region to reach historically marginalized students and reduce barriers to future STEM careers. The regional facility will offer unprecedented opportunities in emerging technologies and the arts to socioeconomically, racially and geographically diverse students. This investment will serve as a catalyst for future private developments and collaboration in the region.Additional Micron community commitments include a partnership with Syracuse University to support new, diverse faculty whose research and teaching will train the workforce of the future through the University’s Future Professors Fellowship Program. Micron will also continue supporting engineering education with regional universities including Clarkson, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Cornell and others. The strong network of northeastern universities will enhance the company’s existing partnership with Rochester Institute of Technology and further increase representation of student groups throughout the engineering and science pipeline.Engaging With Local Communities Micron prioritizes investing in and enriching the communities where its team members live and work. In support of child care and early childhood readiness programs, Micron will make an initial $500,000 investment in the YMCA of Central New York. This investment aims to expand access to high-quality child care and early learning for underserved communities in the region. Micron will continue to partner with the YMCA and other organizations to identify future investments that empower children and families and build an equitable and inclusive community for all.Micron will launch a $500,000 Museum of Science &amp; Technology (MOST) sponsorship. Micron funds will support a long-term MOST exhibit that provides students and their families with hands-on experiences to learn about semiconductors and their common applications. In addition, Micron will make midwinter- and spring-break MOST science camps available to students at no cost and host a STEM education series, as well as design challenges, that promotes continuous learning.Micron’s focus extends deeper into community infrastructure and services, including plans to invest $10 million in venture funding in partnership with the regional tech ecosystem to support and attract new business to Central New York.Recognizing that ongoing and productive engagement with the community is critical to the success of both society and innovative companies like Micron, the company plans to host quarterly community town halls to provide opportunities for Clay, Syracuse and Onondaga County community members to share direct feedback on ways Micron can support their needs.Additional Micron CommitmentsOutside the Community Investment Framework, Micron will continue evaluating ways to support the Central New York region to cultivate the next generation of talent, accelerate economic opportunities for underserved communities, support the region’s infrastructure and build a diverse labor pool.In line with this extended commitment, Micron will establish Syracuse University’s Future-Ready Workforce Innovation Consortium at the College of Professional Studies. In partnership with the Central New York business community, trade unions, community colleges and other four-year institutions in New York State and beyond, Micron will collaborate with Syracuse University to implement a multidimensional and inclusive approach to workforce development, upskilling and professional retention. The Future-Ready Workforce Innovation Consortium will foster an ecosystem for skills training, academic and partnership programs designed to support Micron’s workforce and talent development strategy. Micron will continue evaluating opportunities to leverage community and minority financial institutions as the company grows in the region. This includes making $10 million in deposits with Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) that serve Central New York.To understand and address the challenges associated with access to affordable housing, Governor Hochul announced that the state of New York will be leading an initiative in partnership with Micron and local governments to further identify policies that support better infrastructure, housing opportunities, social and financial inclusion, and the specific and unique hurdles that will face the Syracuse region. The findings will provide a foundation for both short-term opportunities and long-term strategies that Micron can leverage as a committed community partner.Micron will further focus on building a bridge between underserved students and STEM careers in Central New York through the company’s premier, no-cost STEM education program, Chip Camp, for middle and high school students. The program will reach approximately 70 to 100 students a week, providing them with opportunities to learn how semiconductors are made and how STEM skills translate into Micron careers.Statements From Federal, State and Local LeadersBelow are comments made by various leaders about Micron’s historic investment and the company’s community efforts:“We are thrilled to welcome President Biden home to Syracuse! Micron's unprecedented $100 billion investment is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Central New York that will fundamentally transform the region, create tens of thousands of good-paying manufacturing and union construction jobs, strengthen our national security, and breathe new life into America’s legacy as a leader in innovation. Thanks to our CHIPS and Science Bill, and visionary projects like Micron’s, manufacturing is coming back to America and places like Upstate New York. This is our Erie Canal moment and will add to Upstate New York’s semiconductor corridor from the Hudson Valley and Capital Region to the Mohawk Valley and Rochester to ensure the future is built in Upstate New York. This project will be a national blueprint for what investing in workers, the community, and environmental sustainability looks like – and it is because of the leadership of President Biden that we are now building America’s future here in Upstate New York.” – Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer“Over the past few years, U.S. consumers and companies have felt the crippling economic impact of overreliance on foreign companies for semiconductors and disruption of American supply chains. That’s why I fought hard to pass the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which is delivering billions in resources to build our domestic chip industry across the nation and helped solidify Micron's decision to bring their campus to Upstate New York. This tremendous investment will have a ripple effect across Central New York, creating as many as 50,000 well-paying jobs in our state. Thank you, President Biden for visiting Syracuse to celebrate these investments and for being a partner in our efforts to strengthen national security, create good-paying jobs, and pave the way for U.S. leadership in semiconductor technology. I look forward to working with Micron and Central New York to ensure our community has the tools and training to do this important work.” – U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand“I am honored to welcome Micron Technology to Central New York. Micron’s $100 billion investment will create good-paying jobs, jump-start our regional economy and transform Central New York into a hub for semiconductor manufacturing. This is a game-changer for our region, and I am proud to have worked in a bipartisan manner to make the dream of this investment a reality.” – U.S. Representative John Katko“The Central New York community continues to celebrate Micron’s announcement that it will invest up to $100 billion and create 9,000 direct jobs over the next two decades. However, it is the commitments Micron is making through the Community Investment Framework that make this historic deal one that is both transformative for all in Central New York, and the new standard for economic development nationwide. Micron’s investment ensures that this entire community will have the chance to benefit both now and in the decades to come. Micron’s commitment to work with local partners is unprecedented and will scale job-readiness programs, prepare our youngest community members for future careers, expand entrepreneurial and innovation programming, and connect MWBE suppliers to this project. As we work toward our organization’s mission to create a community where businesses thrive and all people prosper, we are exceptionally grateful to have Micron as a partner who shares our vision.” – Robert M. Simpson, President, CenterState CEO“We are honored to welcome President Biden, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and his team, and elected leaders from across our region, New York state, and the nation to the Onondaga Community College campus for today’s historic event. We are proud to be one of Micron’s education partners in their $100 billion investment and look forward to working closely with them as we transform our entire region. Preparing for the education process will include construction of a high-tech “cleanroom” on our campus where students can learn and prepare for rewarding careers in the semiconductor industry. We thank Gov. Kathy Hochul, SUNY Chancellor Deborah Stanley, and Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon for their support as we continue to transform our campus to meet the needs of our workforce partners. Onondaga Community College has come a long way since we opened our doors to students 60 years ago in an abandoned typewriter factory in downtown Syracuse. We are excited to be part of this project, which will transform our region for the next 60 years and beyond.” – Dr. Warren Hilton, Onondaga Community College President“In partnership with Micron, our team is rolling up our sleeves and getting to work. Already, we have several initiatives underway. These include the creation of the Syracuse University Future-Ready Workforce Innovation Consortium, efforts to ramp up Micron’s hiring of veterans and the further investment in the Future Professors Fellowship Program. Individually, these are great opportunities for our university and our community. Combined, they represent transformative and innovative ways to reimagine and reshape how we prepare the next generation of leaders, innovators and disruptors.” – Kent Syverud, Syracuse University Chancellor“The addition of Micron to the Central New York community will provide the Liverpool Central School District, as well as districts across the region, with numerous educational opportunities for students in grades K-12. Programs such as Chip Camp, Girls Going Tech and Careers in a High-Tech World will enhance Liverpool’s newly introduced career pathways that will prepare our students for their future careers. We look forward to working with Micron for years to come.” – Daniel G. Henner, Liverpool Central School District Superintendent of Schools“On behalf of the Central-Northern New York Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, I’m happy to welcome Micron to New York. Micron’s workforce development programs will harness the skills and hardworking nature of New Yorkers, especially those from underserved communities who may not have seen traditional career paths in their futures. The Project Labor Agreement between Micron and our local trade unions will support the representation of minorities, veterans and women in the project workforce while ensuring stability and cooperation with the talented union labor of our region throughout the project. From developing apprenticeship programs to intentionally selecting contractors, Micron is demonstrating its commitment to our community and the incredible potential of our workforce.” – Greg Lancette, New York State Pipe Trades Association PresidentFor more information, reference the New York Community and Workforce Investment fact sheet at Micron.com/NY.About Micron Technology, Inc.We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.

419,3691c89e-b138-3e93-816b-ea4e055e1ba1,YUM,2022-10-27,Yum Brands (YUM) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-yum-expected-beat-140202023.html,1666792922,STORY,"['YUMC', 'YUM']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Yum Brands (YUM) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.64 billion, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yum?For Yum, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.10%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Yum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yum would post earnings of $1.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.05, delivering a surprise of -2.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Yum appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Yum China Holdings (YUMC) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.32 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +45.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.73 billion, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Yum China has been revised 2.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -6.25%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Yum China will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

420,e2e4918f-4b03-3815-8fc2-a42042b718ef,AON,2022-10-27,AON to Report Q3 Earnings: Here's What You Should Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aon-report-q3-earnings-heres-145102967.html,1666795862,STORY,['AON'],"[Aon plc AON is set to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 28, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the leading risk management service provider reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.63, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57, due to solid contributions from Reinsurance Solutions and Health Solutions. Growth in core P&amp;C and an improvement in project-related work in Commercial Risk Solutions also benefited the results. However, the positives were partially offset by frail performance in Wealth Solutions and increased expenses.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of $2.01 has witnessed no movement in the past week. The estimated figure suggests an increase of 15.5% from the prior-year reported number. Our earnings estimate is pegged at $2.02 per share for the third quarter.Aon beat the consensus estimate in three of the prior four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 3.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:Aon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc price-eps-surprise | Aon plc QuoteBoth the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for third-quarter revenues are pegged at $2.8 billion, indicating a 3.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteCommercial Risk Solutions’ performance is likely to have gained from new business generation, robust retention and management of the renewal book portfolio. Increased travel-related spending is expected to have aided the Data &amp; Analytics Services business, which has become part of Commercial Risk Solutions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Commercial Risk Solutions line’s revenues is pegged at $1,584 million, suggesting an increase from the prior-year reported figure of $1,505 million. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $1,581 million for the third quarter.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Health Solutions line’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $518 million, suggesting an improvement from the year-ago period’s $497 million. Our estimate is pegged at $511.9 million. This potential upside might have stemmed from growth in the more discretionary portions of the business, led by an increase in project-related work and strength in voluntary benefits.The consensus mark for Reinsurance Solutions’ revenues is pegged at $372 million, indicating an increase from $353 million a year ago. Our estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $363.6 million. It is likely to have witnessed growth in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of consistent new business generation and growth in capital market transactions. All these factors are likely to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth.However, the consensus mark for organic revenue growth in AON’s Health Solutions business indicates a 57.3% year-over-year decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated organic revenue growth indicates a 48% year-over-year decline, which is concerning.Also, escalating expenses due to substantial investments in the priority areas for long-term growth and an increase in certain discretionary expenses are likely to have affected bottom-line growth, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AON this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -1.68%. The Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $1.98 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AON currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for AON, here are some companies from the broader Finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Axos Financial, Inc. AX has an Earnings ESP of +4.06% and is a Zacks #1 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Axos Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.13 per share, implying a 9.7% improvement from the year-ago figure. AX beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 10.1%.Atlas Corp. ATCO has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and a Zacks Rank of 1.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Atlas’ bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 40 cents per share, which witnessed one upward estimate revision and no downward movements in the past 30 days. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $436.8 million.Trean Insurance Group, Inc. TIG has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trean Insurance’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 9 cents per share, which remained stable over the past week.

That still beat estimates of $5.69 billion.The company's net income fell 8% to $1.98 billion, or $2.68 per share.

Company-operated margins were negatively impacted for both periods by the permanent restaurant closures in Russia and the temporary restaurant closures in Ukraine, as well as by inflationary cost pressures. The nine months also reflected an income tax benefit associated with global tax audit progression. 3 THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AS USED THROUGHOUT THIS RELEASEConstant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.Comparable sales are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities (including restaurants temporarily closed due to COVID-19, as well as those that remain closed in Ukraine). Restaurants in Russia were treated as permanently closed as of April 1, 2022 and therefore excluded from the calculation of comparable sales beginning in the second quarter of 2022. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyper-inflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This includes sales from digital channels, which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.RELATED COMMUNICATIONSThis press release should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K filing for supplemental information related to the Company's results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022.McDonald's Corporation will broadcast its investor earnings conference call live over the Internet at 7:30 a.m. (Central Time) on October 27, 2022.

(NYSE:PLD) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Prologis Prologis Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Lead Independent Director, Irving Lyons, sold US$7.3m worth of shares at a price of US$165 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$108. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In total, Prologis insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Prologis Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Prologis insiders own about US$106m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Prologis Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Prologis insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Prologis insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Be aware that Prologis is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is concerning...Of course Prologis may not be the best stock to buy.

NWL is expected to witness a year-over-year decline in the top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 28, before the opening bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 47 cents, which suggests a decline of 13% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. The consensus mark has moved down 11.3% in the past 60 days. For quarterly revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $2.3 billion, indicating a decline of 19% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based company delivered an earnings surprise of 21.3%. Its bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.5%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNewell Brands Inc. price-eps-surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNewell has been reeling under continued inflationary pressure, a challenging macro environment and fewer retail orders. The company has been witnessing significant inflation in ocean freight, and source finished goods and wages, which have been weighing on consumers’ spending preferences, particularly for the lower income levels.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management revised its outlook for third-quarter 2022. Sales were anticipated to be $2.21-$2.32 billion, down from the prior mentioned $2.39-$2.50 billion. Core sales were likely to decline 8-12% compared with the earlier stated 1-5% decrease. The bottom line was expected to be 46-51 cents, down from the last mentioned 50-54 cents. The normalized operating margin was forecast to be 8.7-9.4%, down from the previously communicated 10.7-11%.However, the company has been gaining from solid demand, product innovation and robust core sales growth. Continued positive momentum in the Writing unit, driven by strength across Sharpie, Paper Mate, Expo, Rubbermaid, Ball and Rubbermaid commercial products, remained key growth drivers. Pricing efforts and stringent overhead cost management bode well.Also, Newell has been on track to leverage its robust e-commerce capabilities, which have been performing well for some time now, owing to increased investments and better customer engagement. Some other notable efforts include buy online and pick up in stores as well as ship from store facilities in its Yankee Candle retail stores.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Newell this time around.

This takes the annual payment to 1.6% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for PACCAR PACCAR's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Before making this announcement, PACCAR was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 28.8% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 38% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.42 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.48. Its dividends have grown at less than 1% per annum over this time frame. Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. PACCAR has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 11% per annum. PACCAR definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.PACCAR Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for PACCAR that you should be aware of before investing.

For a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this and other information visit troweprice.com. Read it carefully.ETFs are bought and sold at market prices, not NAV. Investors generally incur the cost of the spread between the prices at which shares are bought and sold. Buying and selling shares may result in brokerage commissions which will reduce returns.1T. Rowe Price's equity ETFs are different from traditional ETFs. Traditional ETFs tell the public what assets they hold each day. T. Rowe Price's equity ETFs will not. This may create additional risks for your investment. For example:■You may have to pay more money to trade these ETF's shares. These ETFs will provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information.■ The price you pay to buy ETF shares on an exchange may not match the value of the ETF's portfolio. The same is true when you sell shares. These price differences may be greater for this ETF compared to other ETFs because it provides less information to traders.■ These additional risks may be even greater in bad or uncertain market conditions.■ These ETFs will publish on its website each day a ""Proxy Portfolio"" designed to help trading in shares of the ETF. While the Proxy Portfolio includes some of the ETF's holdings, it is not the ETF's actual portfolio.The differences between this ETF and other ETFs may also have advantages. By keeping certain information about the ETF secret, this ETF may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its investment strategy. This may improve the ETF's performance. If other traders are able to copy or predict the ETF's investment strategy, however, this may hurt the ETF's performance.All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. Fixed-income securities are subject to credit risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and interest-rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Investments in high-yield bonds involve greater risk of price volatility, illiquidity, and default than higher-rated debt securities. Derivatives may be riskier or more volatile than other types of investments because they are generally more sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions; risks include currency risk, leverage risk, liquidity risk, index risk, pricing risk, and counterparty risk. The Fund's investments in bank loans may at times become difficult to value and highly illiquid; they are subject to credit risk such as nonpayment of principal or interest, and risks of bankruptcy and insolvency. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.T.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide United Parcel Service with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Quickly Is United Parcel Service Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that United Parcel Service has managed to grow EPS by 31% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that United Parcel Service is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 4.5 percentage points to 14%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of United Parcel Service's forecast profits?Story continuesAre United Parcel Service Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since United Parcel Service has a market capitalisation of US$146b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$117m. This comes in at 0.08% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add United Parcel Service To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, United Parcel Service's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in United Parcel Service's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for United Parcel Service  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

You can skip our detailed discussion on foreign investments, and go directly to read 5 Best Foreign Stocks With Dividends. A Wall Street Journal report published earlier this year cited data from the United Nations and mentioned that foreign investments saw a 77% year-over-year growth in 2021 to $1.65 trillion. The report also highlighted that foreign direct investments (FDI) also reached their pre-pandemic levels, amounting to $1.5 trillion.Bill Bower, a manager of Fidelity Diversified International Fund, thinks that developing markets (DMs) offer great exposure to high-quality companies, which are also traded at lower prices when compared with the US. He further said that investors should focus on these exceptional companies irrespective of their location. A Fidelity report also mentioned that adjusted P/E ratios of non-US stocks were lower than those of the S&amp;P 500 in the second half of 2022, which means that foreign stocks are good value for money and can also offer attractive returns.As 40-year high inflation has taken a toll on global stock markets, analysts recommend investing in dividend companies as they endure periods of stagflation better than their peers. According to a report by JPMorgan, high-quality dividend companies with long tracks of dividend growth resist cutting their dividends in recognition of slow earnings. In this case, these companies are expected to report higher payout ratios during recessionary periods. However, payout ratios this year are currently at low levels as dividends have just recovered from the pandemic of 2020. Some notable dividend stocks that investors are paying attention to include American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). In this article however our focus we be dividend-paying companies headquarter outside of the US.10 Best Foreign Stocks With DividendsImage Source: ShutterstockStory continuesOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that are based outside of the US but are traded on US stock exchanges.

The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields, as of October 25.Best Foreign Stocks With Dividends10. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Dividend Yield as of October 25: 1.40%ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Netherland-based multinational semiconductor company that specializes in chip-making equipment. The company has shown strong results in the third quarter of 2022. It posted €8.9 billion in net bookings and generated €5.8 billion in revenues. The company also repurchased €1 billion worth of its common shares during the quarter.Though ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) does not hold any dividend growth track record, the company has been paying regular dividends to shareholders since 2013. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of €1.37 per share for a dividend yield of 1.40%, as of October 25.In October, JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) with a €690 price target, highlighting the company's recent quarterly earnings.As of the close of Q2 2022, 47 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), up from 46 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of over $3.6 billion.

(NASDAQ:ASML) is also gaining investors' attention in 2022.Baron Funds mentioned ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”9. Linde plc (NYSE:LIN)Dividend Yield as of October 25: 1.68%Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) is a global multinational chemical company, based in Dublin, Ireland. It is one of the world's largest industrial gas companies by market share.Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) reported an operating cash flow of $2.2 billion in Q2 2022, which showed a 17% growth from the same period last year.

These stakes have a total value of over $3.25 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The replacement of demand for Russian gas with green hydrogen positions Linde (NYSE:LIN) well. Green hydrogen, made by using renewable energy to split water into its basic elements, hydrogen and oxygen, and subsequently cleanly burn the hydrogen as fuel, is seen as key to lowering emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries such as steel and cement, as well as transport. In 2021 Linde announced a long-term agreement to provide European semiconductor maker Infineon (OTCQX:IFNNY) with onsite production and storage of green hydrogen for the company’s site in Villach, Austria. Securing a clean, domestic source of energy for semiconductor manufacturing appears strategic today amid heightened concerns of reliable supply from Taiwan.”8. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Dividend Yield as of October 25: 3.70%Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a London-based multinational oil and gas company that also specializes in petrochemicals. The company recently announced its 9.375% stake in QatarEnergy's 16 million metric tons/year North Field South liquefied natural gas project.

The company raised its dividends four times after the pandemic, coming through as one of the best foreign stocks.

The firm remained bullish on integrated oils and appreciated the company’s strategic properties.At the end of June 2022, 39 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned positions in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), with stakes valued at over $3.46 billion.Harding Loevner mentioned Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multi-national companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”7. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Dividend Yield as of October 25: 4.22%Another best foreign stock on our list is Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) which is a British multinational consumer goods company. In the past five years, the company has raised its dividends at a CAGR of 4.63%. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.4343 per share for a dividend yield of 4.22%, as of October 25.In September, Morgan Stanley initiated its coverage on Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) with an Equal Weight rating. The firm mentioned that analysts are increasingly favoring UL in the food sector and expect growth in its earnings in the coming quarters.In the second quarter of 2022, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) reported an operating cash flow of $8 billion and its free cash flow came in at €2.2 billion. The company's strong cash flow signals continuous shareholder return. Its payout ratio stands at 75.8%.At the end of Q2 2022, 21 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), compared with 23 in the previous quarter. These stakes hold a total value of over $813.3 million. Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q2.Polen Capital mentioned Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Multinational consumer goods company Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) showed robust price increases overall, with minimal impact on volume, resulting in faster-than-expected sales growth during the quarter. Indeed, higher inflation can be a positive change for companies with favorable brands like Unilever as these conditions make it easier for the biggest brands to raise prices, continue spending on advertising, and take share. We believe the appointment of an activist investor to Unilever’s board in June will help spur additional growth.”6. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)Dividend Yield as of October 25: 4.28%Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is a multinational pharmaceutical company, headquartered in Switzerland. The company is widely known for its oncology products and is also the leader in the field of generic drugs.Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) recently reported its third-quarter results and reported a 4% growth in its sales. The company generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow, up from $3.3 billion in the previous quarter.

In 2021, it paid $7.5 billion in dividends to its stakeholders.Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 25 years. It currently offers an annual dividend of CHF 3.10 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.28%, as of October 25. The company can be a good addition to dividend portfolios alongside Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).Kepler Cheuvreux upgraded Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) to Buy with a CHF 90 price target in September. The firm mentioned the company has reported strong sales but also needs to enhance its research and development abilities.At the end of June 2022, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), up from 21 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $1.76 billion.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.5%.Revenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, up 14.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.48% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Martin Marietta?For Martin Marietta, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.99%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Martin Marietta will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Martin Marietta would post earnings of $3.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.96, delivering a surprise of +6.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Analog Devices (ADI) earns a Zacks Rank #3 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 22, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.59 a share.Analog Devices' Earnings ESP sits at 0.32%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.59 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58.ADI is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. NetApp (NTAP) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.NetApp is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 29, 2022. NTAP's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.35 a share 34 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NetApp is $1.34, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.68%.Story continuesADI and NTAP's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zimmer?For Zimmer, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Zimmer will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zimmer would post earnings of $1.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.82, delivering a surprise of +11.66%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Zimmer doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Products industry, MacroGenics (MGNX) is soon expected to post loss of $0.49 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +43%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $22.74 million, up 45.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for MacroGenics has been revised 691.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 25.77%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that MacroGenics will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to loss of $0.06 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -66.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this provider of equipment and services to energy companies would post earnings of $0.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.02, delivering a surprise of -50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.FMC Technologies , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, posted revenues of $1.73 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.69%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.FMC Technologies shares have added about 80.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for FMC Technologies?While FMC Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for FMC Technologies: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.07 on $1.67 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.16 on $6.69 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Field Services is currently in the top 12% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.ProPetro Holding (PUMP), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 1.This oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +640%.

Total Company revenue of $1.7 billion was a solid achievement given the currency headwind experienced during the period. Adjusted EBITDA was $200 million with a margin of 11.5% when excluding foreign exchange loss. Subsea and Surface Technologies both achieved sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin in the period.""Pferdehirt added, ""In Subsea, inbound was $1.4 billion, with year-to-date orders now totaling $5.2 billion, exceeding the level achieved in all of last year. Our Subsea Opportunities list remains at a record level. This strong project pipeline and the active dialogue with our large and expanded customer base give us continued confidence that our full-year Subsea orders will approach $7 billion, up as much as 40 percent versus the prior year. Extending the outlook into 2023, we believe orders over the next five quarters will be at least $9 billion.""""In Surface Technologies, inbound increased sequentially by approximately 65% to $449 million, representing a book-to-bill of 1.4. The strong order activity benefited from the acceleration of orders from Aramco, which was a significant achievement in the period. A large portion of these awards will result in revenue in future periods, providing us with increased visibility for continued growth in our international revenue in 2023.""Pferdehirt continued, ""We continue to see the potential for strong growth in EBITDA, cash flow and financial returns, as evidenced by our stated objective to achieve more than $1 billion of Subsea EBITDA by 2025. Further demonstrating our confidence in this outlook, we announced a new $400 million share buyback program in July, which we quickly put into action with the repurchase of $50 million of our ordinary shares in the third quarter.""Pferdehirt concluded, ""The next leg of growth in oil and gas will be fueled by offshore and the Middle East. The bold steps we took more than five years ago to create TechnipFMC have resulted in a pure-play technology company that is uniquely levered to both of these markets. Our portfolio of innovative products, solutions and disruptive commercial models has further strengthened our leadership position, and we are now taking full advantage of the market growth that lies ahead.""Operational and Financial HighlightsSubseaFinancial HighlightsReconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in financial schedules.Three Months EndedChange(In millions)Sep. 30,2022Jun. 30,2022Sep. 30,2021SequentialYear-over-YearRevenue$1,415.0$1,414.6$1,312.10.0%7.8%Operating profit$105.0$97.1$23.58.1%346.8%Adjusted EBITDA$183.8$176.0$146.54.4%25.5%Adjusted EBITDA margin13.0%12.4%11.2%60 bps180 bpsInbound orders$1,400.8$1,928.0$1,116.0(27.3%)25.5%Backlog1,2,3$7,603.2$7,926.3$6,661.4(4.1%)14.1%Estimated Consolidated Backlog Scheduling(In millions)Sep. 30,20222022 (3 months)$9962023$3,7472024 and beyond$2,860Total$7,6031 Backlog as of Sep. 30, 2022 was reduced by a foreign exchange impact of $307 million.2 Backlog does not capture all revenue potential for Subsea Services.3 Backlog as of Sep. 30, 2022 does not include total Company non-consolidated backlog of $509 million.Subsea reported third quarter revenue of $1,415 million, flat sequentially versus the second quarter.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Pentair's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Pentair How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pentair is:22% = US$564m ÷ US$2.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.22.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Pentair's Earnings Growth And 22% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Pentair has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, Pentair's exceptional 23% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesWe then compared Pentair's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 8.6% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Pentair is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Pentair Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Pentair's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 31%, meaning the company retains 69% of its income. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Pentair is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Additionally, Pentair has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 20% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Pentair's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The reported figure matches the lower end of the adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 43-45 cents. The quarter’s adjustments included certain amortization expenses, intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestitures-related net charges, and restructuring charges among others.Reported EPS in the third quarter was 12 cents, a 57.1% drop from the year-ago quarter’s 28 cents per share.Revenues of $3.17 billion in the third quarter improved 8.1% year over year on a reported basis and 13.7% on an operational basis (at constant exchange rate or CER). Revenues grew 11.5% on an organic basis (adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations and certain recent acquisitions and divestments). The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%. The quarter’s top-line performance also exceeded the company’s projection of organic revenue growth of approximately 8-10%.Q3 Revenues in DetailIn the third quarter, revenues rose 12% in the United States on a reported basis (same operationally). Revenues were down 0.8% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region (up 15.2%) but rose 2.8% in the Asia Pacific zone (up 15.3%). Revenues increased 20.4% in Latin America and Canada (up 24.2%) and 28.1% in emerging markets (up 40%).Segmental AnalysisBoston Scientific recently reorganized its operational structure and aggregated its core businesses, each of which generates revenues from the sale of Medical Devices, into two reportable segments, MedSurg and Cardiovascular.The company generates maximum revenues from Cardiovascular. Sales from its sub-segments, Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions were $1.48 billion (up 12.8% year over year organically) and $479 million (up 12%), respectively, in the third quarter.Story continuesBoston Scientific Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteWithin MedSurg, Endoscopy generated revenues of $559 million, up 10.4% organically. Urology and Pelvic Health revenues were $433 million, reflecting organic growth of 12.6%. Neuromodulation within MedSurg reported $221 million in revenues, reflecting a 3.2% rise organically year over year.MarginsGross margin in the third quarter contracted 19 basis points (bps) year over year to 69.1%. There was an 8.8% rise in the cost of products sold to $979 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 6.2% to $1.13 billion. Research and development expenses rose 9.4% to $339 million. Royalty expenses of $11 million declined 21.4% year over year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 47 bps to 22.4% in the reported quarter.2022 GuidanceBoston Scientific updated full-year 2022 guidance and also provided guidance for the fourth quarter.Full-year net sales growth expectation has been narrowed to 6.5% (previously 6.5-7.5%) on a reported basis. However, net sales growth is now expected at 9% (previously 8-9%) on an organic basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $12.71 billion, indicating a 6.9% rise from the 2021 reported figure. The lower end of the full-year adjusted EPS was reduced to $1.71 to $1.74 ($1.74 to $1.77 expected previously). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 remains above the guided range.For the fourth quarter of 2022, revenue growth is projected in the range of approximately 2-4% on a reported basis (an increase of 7-9% organically). Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of 45-48 cents per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings and revenues is pegged at 48 cents and $3.31 billion, respectively.Our TakeBoston Scientific third quarter of 2022 adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same.  The company registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues.Organic revenues at each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter. However, mounting costs and expenses put pressure on the company’s margins.The updated 2022 guidance seems lackluster, indicating the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderBoston Scientific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the medical sector include Chimerix CMRX, McKesson MCK and Humana HUM.Chimerix currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

While quarterly earnings are expected to have witnessed a fall on a year-over-year basis, revenues are likely to have risen.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were affected by higher provisions for credit losses and an increase in operating expenses. Yet, a robust improvement in loan balances and higher interest rates aided net interest income (NII). Further decent consumer sentiments supported the credit card business and non-interest income.Capital One has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 9.41%. Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCapital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCapital One Financial Corporation price-eps-surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteKey Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3Net interest income (NII): In the third quarter, the demand for consumer loans was robust, which drove the loan balances. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total average earning assets of $406.6 billion indicates a 4.9% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. We project this metric to be $398.6 billion, implying 2.8% growth.Capital One’s efforts to strengthen its card operations are expected to have provided further support to loan growth. Along with the increase in loan balances, higher interest rates are expected to have positively impacted the company’s NII. The consensus estimate for NII of $6.77 billion indicates a 10% year-over-year improvement. Our estimate for NII stands at $6.67 billion, reflecting an increase of 8.3%.Fee income: Supported by the rise in card usage, Capital One’s interchange fee (constituting more than 60% of fee income) is likely to have been positively impacted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $1.14 billion, indicating an 11.6% growth on a year-over-year basis. We anticipate interchange fee to be $1.11 billion, suggesting an 8.8% improvement.The consensus estimate for service charges and other customer-related fees (constituting almost 20% of fee income) of $420 million suggests a 3.2% increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for other non-interest income is pegged at $213 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 12.3%. Our estimates for service charges and other customer-related fees, and other non-interest income are $430.7 million and 307.9 million, respectively.The consensus estimate for total non-interest income of $1.76 billion suggests a rise of 5.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. We expect the metric to grow 10.5% to $1.85 billion.Expenses: Capital One has been witnessing a persistent rise in expenses over the past several years because of higher marketing costs. The company’s investment in technology upgrades leads to higher costs. These, along with rising inflation, are expected to have resulted in an increase in operating expenses in the third quarter.Our estimate for total non-interest expenses stands at $4.94 billion, reflecting an increase of 18% year over year.Asset Quality: With the rise in loan balance and expectations of economic slowdown due to geopolitical and inflation concerns, Capital One is likely to have built reserves in the third quarter.Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $1.07 billion against a provision benefit of $342 million a year ago.Story continuesEarnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are low. This is because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is -1.76%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Capital One’s third-quarter earnings of $5.03 has been revised marginally lower over the past seven days. The figure indicates a plunge of 26.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for earnings per share of $5.12 suggests a 25.4% decline.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $8.60 billion, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 9.9%. We project this metric to be 8.52 billion, reflecting an 8.8% growth.Stocks That Warrant a LookA couple of other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:The Earnings ESP for First Citizens BancShares, Inc.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) share price is up 95% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 42% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 8.0%.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Ulta Beauty managed to grow its earnings per share at 24% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Ulta Beauty has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Ulta Beauty has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 8.0% in the last twelve months. However, that falls short of the 14% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Ulta Beauty better, we need to consider many other factors.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures may be useful for period-over-period comparisons of underlying business trends and our ongoing business performance, however, they should be used in conjunction with GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define similarly named measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. We utilize the following definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this release and have provided a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for each measure:Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAdjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude special charges, net of tax. We consider items recorded in special charges, such as enterprise-wide restructuring, certain asset impairment charges, and acquisition-related restructuring, integration and transaction costs, to be of a non-recurring nature that is not indicative of ongoing operations. The gain on disposition, net of tax is also excluded as it relates to a disposition in connection with our enterprise-wide restructuring plan, which resulted in the sale of the TRU Simulation + Training Canada Inc. business.Three Months EndedNine Months EndedOctober 2, 2021October 2, 2021Diluted EPSDiluted EPSAdjusted income from continuing operations - GAAP$185$0.82$540$2.37Add: Special charges, net of tax80.03150.07Less: Gain on business disposition, net of tax——(17)(0.08)Adjusted income from continuing operations - Non-GAAP$193$0.85$538$2.36Manufacturing Cash Flow Before Pension ContributionsManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions adjusts net cash from operating activities (GAAP) for the following:Deducts capital expenditures and includes proceeds from insurance recoveries and the sale of property, plant and equipment to arrive at the net capital investment required to support ongoing manufacturing operations;Excludes dividends received from Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and capital contributions to TFC provided under the Support Agreement and debt agreements as these cash flows are not representative of manufacturing operations;Adds back pension contributions as we consider our pension obligations to be debt-like liabilities. Additionally, these contributions can fluctuate significantly from period to period and we believe that they are not representative of cash used by our manufacturing operations during the period.While we believe this measure provides a focus on cash generated from manufacturing operations, before pension contributions, and may be used as an additional relevant measure of liquidity, it does not necessarily provide the amount available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations that are not deducted from the measure.Three Months EndedNine Months EndedOctober 1, 2022October 2, 2021October 1, 2022October 2, 2021Net cash from operating activities - GAAP$356$333$945$1,012Less: Capital expenditures(78)(76)(192)(204)Plus: Total pension contributions11113640Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment33213Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions - Non-GAAP$292$271$810$8512022 OutlookNet cash from operating activities - GAAP$1,404—$1,504Less: Capital expenditures(375)Add: Total pension contributions50Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment21Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions - Non-GAAP$1,100—$1,200View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221027005026/en/ContactsInvestor Contacts: Eric Salander – 401-457-2288Cameron Vollmuth – 401-457-2288Media Contact: Mike Maynard – 401-457-2362]"

Another cohort of major aerospace &amp; defense stocks like Textron Inc. TXT, Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC and L3Harris Technologies LHX are set to announce their earnings on Oct 27.Factors That Influenced Aerospace &amp; Defense StocksGrowing global air travel demand, driven by a steady recovery in the domestic space as well as improving trends observed in international air travel, is expected to significantly boost the Q3 results of aerospace and defense stocks, particularly those engaged in commercial aviation. Evidently, Boeing witnessed a solid year-over-year surge of 31.8% in its commercial shipments during the third quarter. With Boeing being the largest jet maker in the nation, we expect the Q3 results of the remaining aerospace majors to reflect a similar improvement in delivery trends. Such solid deliveries must have boosted the overall top-line growth of the Aerospace sector, which houses all aerospace and defense stocks.Stocks in this industry that are more focused on combat must have gained as a result of steady government support. Moreover, a steady order flow observed in the past couple of quarters, along with improving delivery trends in recent times, buoyed by recovering economic trends are projected to have bolstered Q3 revenues of aerospace and defense stocks.However, persistent headwinds like supply chain disruption along with some unfavorable project timing as the result of coronavirus might have an adverse impact on the Q3 bottom line of the industry.Q3 ProjectionsAerospace sector Q3 earnings are expected to slip 0.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure, while revenues are projected to improve 8.2%.  For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through the latest Earnings Preview.Story continuesAerospace &amp; Defense Stocks to WatchLet's take a look at three defense companies that are scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 27 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcements.Textron’s Q3 results are likely to reflect mixed segmental performance. Notably, a steady air travel trend has been boosting the commercial aviation market, which in turn must have bolstered TXT’s aviation segment’s Q3 performance, while lower revenues related to lower H-1 production are expected to have hurt the performance of the Bell segment.The addition of PIPISTREL, post its acquisition this April, must have also boosted Q3 revenue growth (read more: Will Mixed Segment Performance Aid Textron's Q3 Earnings?).According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

While an increase in restricted sales in the Networked Information Solutions business area and higher volumes on the Ground/Air Task-Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) and Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program must have boosted Mission Systems’ Q3 performance, lower volumes from manned aircraft and autonomous systems might have unfavorably impacted the revenue performance of the Aeronautics segment.Meanwhile, higher sales from the Launch &amp; Strategic Missiles and Space business areas are expected to bolster the Space Systems unit’s results.Northrop has an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and a Zacks Rank #4 (read more: Will Segmental Sales Benefit Northrop's Q3 Earnings?).Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNorthrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNorthrop Grumman Corporation price-eps-surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteL3Harris Technologies’ Q3 results are likely to reflect solid sales performance in the majority of its segments.

This compares to earnings of $3.07 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.16%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this defense contractor would post earnings of $2.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.75, delivering a surprise of 1.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.General Dynamics , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, posted revenues of $9.98 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.56%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $9.57 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.General Dynamics shares have added about 17.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for General Dynamics?While General Dynamics has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for General Dynamics: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.63 on $10.91 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $12.16 on $39.39 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Aerospace - Defense is currently in the bottom 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Textron (TXT), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.

The top line increased 17.22% year over year, with all key segments, including merchandise, intermodal and coal registering improvement in revenues. Revenue per unit rose 20% year over year, driven by higher fuel surcharges and pricing.Total volumes declined 2% year over year due to network challenges.Income from railway operations climbed 12% year over year to $1,271 million. Railway operating expenses shot up 21% on a year-over-year basis to $2,071 million, primarily due to higher fuel expenses and purchased services. Norfolk Southern’s operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated to 62% in the second quarter from 60.2% in the year-ago quarter due to higher costs.In the first nine months of 2022, NSC rewarded its shareholders with $3,165 million through dividends ($881 million) and share repurchases ($2,284 million).Segmental PerformanceMerchandise revenues climbed 13% year over year to $1,930 million.

UAL’s revenues increased more than 66% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand.

Moreover, these industry-leading companies are also favored because of their dividends and yields. Over the years, the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA have shown a strong correlation, however, their performances have branched off in the past. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, the Dow has slightly outperformed the broader market in the last 30 years ending June 2021.

Freeland noted that ​​The Bank of Canada's latest rate hikes to control rampant inflation will raise borrowing costs for businesses and consumers alike, which will send tremors of shock through the economy in the near-term. The Bank of Canada, like the United States' Federal Reserve, aims to target price stability and bring inflation down to 2%. This attempt by the central bank could trigger a recession in 2023. While the finance minister said that the government cannot possibly compensate every Canadian who is impacted by the skyrocketing inflation, the most vulnerable people will be helped so they can cover the rising costs of food and rent. Freeland highlighted the passage of Bill C-30, a government legislation to double the GST credit paid to low-income households for a while. Canadian consumer confidence fell to an all-time low apart from the last two economic crises, which increases the likelihood of a recession. Amid a chaotic market environment, notable equities listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange are trading at significant discounts. While investors usually pile into defensive names like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in a volatile market, it is a good idea to jump into some TSX stocks for broader exposure. Our Methodology We selected the best TSX stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong underlying business fundamentals, and future growth prospects once the market gains momentum. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continues10 Best TSX Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by buian_photos on UnsplashBest TSX Stocks To Buy Now10. Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) was founded in 1864 and is headquartered in Toronto, Canada. It is a diversified financial service company working worldwide, operating through Personal &amp; Commercial Banking, Wealth Management, Insurance, Investor &amp; Treasury Services, and Capital Markets segments. On October 4, Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) announced that it has acquired MDBilling.ca, a cloud-based platform that automates and simplifies medical billing for doctors in Canada. This acquisition advances RBC's existing medical billing firm portfolio.On September 29, Barclays analyst John Aiken reinstated coverage of Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) with an Overweight rating and a C$137 price target after the conclusion of the Brewin Dolphin acquisition. The purchase of the discretionary wealth manager places Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) in the top three asset managers in the U.K. and Ireland, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 12 hedge funds were long Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO), compared to 21 funds in the last quarter. D E Shaw held a notable position in the company, comprising 342,394 shares worth $33 million. In addition to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) is one of the best stocks to consider for a balanced portfolio. Here is what Gator Capital Management has to say about Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“We own a position in Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”) and are completing our due diligence on several other Canadian banks. Royal Bank is the #1 bank in Canada. It has a business mix similar to JP Morgan Chase (“JPM”) with strong retail and corporate banking businesses. It also has a significant investment banking and asset management business. From here, we believe Canadian bank stocks will generate attractive returns for shareholders in the medium and long term.Here is more detail on our investment thesis for Royal Bank of Canada: Bank with consistently high returns – RBC consistently posts Return on Tangible Common Equity (“ROTCE”) in the low 20%. In contrast, JPM has reported ROTCE between 12% and 19% over the last six years. We think this reflects the higher margins of the Canadian banking system. Leading bank in Canada – RBC is the leading bank in Canada. It has the highest returns, the highest market share, and the highest valuation of the five major Canadian banks. We believe other stock market investors will favor RBC when Canadian banks regain favor. Low relative valuation to US Banks – Canadian banks have had premium valuations compared to US banks for a few decades due to their higher and more consistent returns. Over the last 10 years, this valuation premium has almost disappeared. The chart below shows the price-to-tangible book ratio (“P/TB”) of RBC compared to JPM’s. As you can see, in 2011 RBC traded at 3x P/TB while JPM traded at 1x. Now, both banks trade at 2.5x P/TB. Strong growth at City National – RBC’s US Subsidiary, City National Bank, is growing very quickly. RBC purchased City National in 2015. City National was an LA-based bank focused on high-net-worth customers. At the time of the purchase, City National had already expanded and gained traction in San Francisco and New York. Now, City National has branches in Washington, DC, Atlanta, Miami, Dallas, Minneapolis, San Diego, and Las Vegas. City National has a banking strategy similar to that of First Republic and is growing at a comparable rate. We would note that First Republic trades at 26x 2021 estimated earnings.

Currently, the company’s earnings are depressed due to semiconductor supply constraints that are impacting the entire industry. We expect these constraints to prove transitory, and we’re confident that component shortages will be resolved in the coming years. Furthermore, we believe that OEMs are likely to rely heavily on third-party suppliers, like BorgWarner, to leverage R&amp;D expenses to enhance innovation and speed-to-market in an electrified world. For decades, we’ve been impressed with how BorgWarner management has successfully acquired and scaled fuel efficiency technologies for internal combustion engines. We see strong parallels and underappreciated potential in the acquisitions the company has made over the past 5+ years in key electric vehicle technologies. We believe the company is well-positioned to manufacture and integrate new propulsion systems and components to meet customer demands.”BorgWarner Inc.

492,3f8ef051-7bc0-350c-a0f5-8d88f991c85a,INCY,2022-10-27,Will Clovis Oncology (CLVS) Report Negative Q3 Earnings? What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clovis-oncology-clvs-report-negative-140202187.html,1666792922,STORY,['INCY'],"[The market expects Clovis Oncology (CLVS) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +25%.Revenues are expected to be $34.79 million, down 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.54% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Clovis?For Clovis, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.61%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Clovis will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Clovis would post a loss of $0.42 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.43, delivering a surprise of -2.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Clovis doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerIncyte (INCY), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.74 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -37.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $855.37 million, up 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Incyte has been revised 0.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -11.65%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Incyte will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Williams Companies Inc. WMB, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR, Incyte Corp. INCY, Hubbell Inc. HUBB and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. LW.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:A Bear Market Rally or Markets Forming a Solid Base? 5 PicksWall Street is witnessing a good rally in October after a horrible September. Historically, several major stock market crashes happened this month. However, this year, it looks like October will see a happy ending.Month to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite — have advanced 9.7%, 5.9% and 3.6%. On the other hand, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plummeted 13.3%, 20.3% and 30%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are in bear market territory. That is why, financial experts have characterized the ongoing October rally as a bear market rally or a relief rally, similar to the one we saw from mid-June to mid-August.Although market participants are yet to be convinced about bottoming out, October's rally has some positives. Let's discuss briefly.Are Markets Trying to Form a Base?U.S. stock markets have seen extreme intraday fluctuations in the past one month. The Dow has recorded around 600-700 points of intraday swing and the Nasdaq Composite has seen 300-400 points of intraday swing. The S&amp;P 500 has registered 50-60 points of intraday swing in the past month. If we consider, pre-market movements of index futures, intraday fluctuations of these three indexes will be much wider.This clearly shows that investors are unleashing both ""Sale on the Rise"" and ""Buy on the Dip"" strategies to strengthen their portfolios. Since the market is uncertain about the future movement of the interest rate and Fed's tightening, investors are taking a short-term view and selling stocks to book quick profits. At the same time, markets are no longer showing a secular downtrend. This means that some sort of sentiments is growing among investors regarding bottoming out.Story continuesWhen such a situation arises, the market seems to form a base on which it can ride for the long term growth trajectory. In U.S. stock markets, this type of scenario has been visible in the past month. From here the market can witness a steep rise if a minimum positive clue comes from the Fed. Other PositivesLast week, The Wall Street Journal reported that some Fed officials are skeptical about the continuation of the central bank's aggressive rate hike and tighter monetary control. The officials have already started to express their desire to slow down the pace of rate hikes soon and to stop raising rates altogether early next year. They want to reduce the risk of a hard landing of the economy caused by the policy interventions of the Fed.The Fed has already hiked the benchmark lending rate by 3% in 2022. The cumulative effect of a higher interest rate regime takes time to be visible in the economy. A section of market participants led by Ark Investment Management believes that the central bank should not take decisions about the future course of interest rate movement based on lag indicators like nonfarm payrolls and inflation rates.Instead, the Fed should take a decision on lead indicators like declining commodity prices (except food and energy), growing accumulation of inventories on the part of manufacturers and retailers, gradual slowdown of the ISM manufacturing PMI and a decline in the job openings rate. All these lead indicators point to the cooling down of the U.S. economy.Stock Selection ProcessAn upward EPS estimate revision for any stock for the rest of 2022 simply means that the market is expecting the company to do good business this year. A positive estimate revision within the last 30 days means that the market is thinking positively about the company.Therefore, a positive EPS estimate revision under growing threats of inflation highlights the solid business model and robust growth potential of a company. Investors can certainly take a look at these stocks that currently have strong earnings momentum.We have narrowed our search to five such large-cap U.S. companies with strong potential for the rest of 2022. These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Williams Companies Inc. operates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States. With U.S. natural gas demand projected to grow significantly in the long term, WMB seems well positioned to capitalize on the same owing to its impressive portfolio of large-scale value-creating projects.In particular, the company's existing and expansionary development projects associated with the massive Transco gas transmission system are expected to boost Williams' growth prospects. WMB's thriving deepwater transportation business is another positive.The Williams Companies has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.1% over the last seven days.Interactive Brokers Group Inc. operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. IBKR specializes in executing and clearing trades in securities, futures, foreign exchange instruments, bonds, and mutual funds.Interactive Brokers Group's efforts to develop proprietary software (including IBKR Lite), its low level of compensation expenses relative to net revenues and an increase in emerging market customers will likely continue aiding its financials. The acquisition of the retail unit of Folio Investments will strengthen IBKR's position in the online brokerage space.Interactive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 16.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.8% over the last seven days.Incyte Corp. focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of various therapeutics in the United States. lINCY's lead drug, Jakafi, higher royalty revenues and encouraging uptake of other recently approved drugs maintain momentum for the company. Jakafi's label expansion in additional indications is anticipated to further drive sales, and the company has raised the bottom end of full-year Jakafi net product revenue guidance.The recent FDA approval of ruxolitinib cream under the brand name Opzelura has diversified the portfolio of Incyte. The uptake of Pemazyre and other newly approved drugs like Monjuvi and Tabrecta is positive and should boost sales. The label expansion of these drugs is also positive and will generate incremental sales.Incyte has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.Hubbell Inc. is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of electrical and electronic products to commercial, industrial, utility and telecommunications markets.

494,e5d44818-4adf-3c29-896a-afd66d98ae29,WM,2022-10-27,Investors in Waste Management (NYSE:WM) have made a impressive return of 116% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-waste-management-nyse-wm-120051115.html,1666872051,STORY,['WM'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) share price is up 97% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 42% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 4.7% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Waste Management While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Waste Management managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Waste Management has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Waste Management, it has a TSR of 116% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Waste Management shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.7% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, that falls short of the 17% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Waste Management better, we need to consider many other factors.

For the quarter, the RiverPark Large Growth Fund (the “Fund”) lost 3.3% - a bit better than the S&amp;P 500 (-4.9% for the quarter) and about in line with the Russell 1000 Growth index (-3.6% for the quarter). Try to spare some time to check the fund's top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, RiverPark Large Growth Fund mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1983, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a Mountain View, California-based business software company with a $121.7 billion market capitalization. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) delivered a -32.83% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -29.01%. The stock closed at $432.08 per share on October 25, 2022.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""We took advantage of its 2022 price decline to add a small position in Intuit. INTU is a leading SaaS software solutions provider to small businesses, consumers, and professional accountants, best known for its QuickBooks accounting and TurboTax tax preparation platforms. INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp. The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for both businesses and consumers. Given its vast amount of valuable personal finance and tax customer data from its 100 million + customer installed base, the company can apply artificial intelligence to the data to generate actionable intelligence for customers, as well as a large cross-selling opportunity across its products.Given INTU’s less than 5% penetration of its $300 billion market, we believe the company can grow its top-line mid-teens, while improving its high-margin business model of greater than 80% gross margins and greater than 35% EBITDA margin, leading to high-teens EPS growth for the foreseeable future. At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.""Story continuesMajor Retailers and Services That Accept Bitcoin in 2018alphaspirit/Shutterstock.comOur calculations show that Intuit Inc.

502,f118bef8-273c-37ee-82be-deecebdc0695,SYK,2022-10-27,Earnings Preview: Owens & Minor (OMI) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-owens-minor-omi-140202143.html,1666792922,STORY,"['OMI', 'SYK']","[The market expects Owens &amp; Minor (OMI) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical supply distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -47.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.42 billion, down 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 43.06% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Owens &amp; Minor?For Owens &amp; Minor, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Owens &amp; Minor will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Owens &amp; Minor would post earnings of $0.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Owens &amp; Minor doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Products industry, Stryker (SYK) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.26 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +2.7%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Danaher Corp. DHR, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, Starbucks Corp. SBUX, The TJX Companies, Inc TJX and Stryker Corp. SYK.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Danaher, Comcast and StarbucksThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. In today's Research Daily, we provide the updated Q3 earnings season scorecard, in addition to featuring new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Danaher Corp., Comcast Corp. and Starbucks Corp.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding all of this morning's results, we now have Q3 results from 129 S&amp;P 500 members or 25.8% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -0.5% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues, with 73.6% beating EPS estimates and 64.3% beating revenue estimates.The Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace and the EPS beats percentage for this group of 129 index members is better than what we saw from this group in the preceding period. The revenue beats percentage for this group of 129 index members at 64.3% is modestly below the 66.7% for this group in 2022 Q2, but otherwise well within the historical range.This is a reassuring showing on the corporate earnings front that runs counter to pre-season fears of an impending earnings cliff that will result in companies overwhelmingly guiding lower. We have seen some of those. But for the most part, management teams have either guided higher, reaffirmed previous outlook or provided favorable qualitative commentary.Story continuesA case in point is this morning's UPS report whose reaffirmed guidance ran counter to what we had heard from FedEx a few weeks back. While 3M guided lower, Coke and GM provided favorable commentary.With respect to the coming periods, expectations are getting reset lower, as we have consistently been pointing out all along.S&amp;P 500 earnings for the last quarter of the year (2022 Q4) are currently expected to be up only +0.1% from the same period last year, which is down from +1.1% on October 19th and +2.5% on August 31st. Excluding contribution from the Energy sector, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index are currently expected to be down -4% from the year-earlier period, which is down from -3.6% on October 19th and -1.9% on August 31st.Full year 2023 expectations are similarly coming down.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Preview article &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here's What to Expect from Big Tech EarningsToday's Featured Research ReportsShares of Danaher have declined -17.7% over the past year against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry's decline of -25.4%. High raw material costs, and component shortages, due to supply chain issues, are weighing on the company's operations. Coronavirus-induced headwinds in China add to its woes. Adverse foreign currency movements are affecting Danaher's top line.However, strong segmental performances are driving Danaher's growth. Robust activity in bioprocessing and strength in instrument business are boosting the Life Sciences unit's performance. Robust growth in Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics is acting as a catalyst to the Diagnostics segment's growth. Inorganic activities are contributing to the company's top line growth. Danaher's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends are encouraging.(You can read the full research report on Danaher here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Comcast shares have declined -42.5% over the past year against the Zacks Cable Television industry's decline of -47.0%. The company is persistently suffering from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.Though Comcast is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base. Slowing broadband user base addition primarily due to reversal of pandemic trends and increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber are concerns.Nevertheless, Comcast's plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help the company in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors. Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Starbucks shares have underperformed against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-26.1% vs. -13.5%). The company's performance continues to be negatively impacted by dismal China results, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, increased costs and a tight labor market. The company believes that performance will be under massive pressure for the rest of the year.However, Starbucks has been benefiting from operating fundamentals such as a solid global footprint, successful innovations and digital offerings. North America comps continue to impress investors.For fiscal 2023 to 2025, Starbucks anticipates global and U.S. comparable store sales growth between 7% and 9% year over year. For fiscal 2023 to 2025, it expects its global store portfolio to increase approximately 7% annually, up from the prior estimate of 6%.(You can read the full research report on Starbucks here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The TJX Companies, Inc. and Stryker Corp..Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

506,d4f9d233-ab51-30e0-a4be-b9a8451539b9,WHR,2022-10-27,International Seaways and Whirlpool Corporation have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-seaways-whirlpool-corporation-highlighted-114311694.html,1666784591,STORY,"['WHR', 'BA', 'INSW', 'GD', 'TDY']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 26, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares International Seaways INSW as the Bull of the Day and Whirlpool Corporation WHR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Teledyne Technologies TDY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:International Seaways, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of this year's biggest market winners. INSW hit an all-time high in price this month in a sign of strength, all while most stocks hover in bear market territory. The company's longevity and continued stock price ascent speak to management's ability to adapt to the ever-changing market landscape. INSW sports a 'B' rating for our Zacks Momentum Style Score, indicating a strong likelihood that the stock propels higher on the powerful combination of positive earnings estimate revisions and stock price performance.International Seaways is part of the Zacks Transportation – Shipping industry, which is currently ranked in the top 16% out of over 250 industries. This group has widely outperformed the market with a 29% return year-to-date.Despite shipping rates coming down from their peak, companies within the shipping industry have continued to flourish. While an absence of high congestion has established a path to lower rates, any changes in China's Covid-zero policy or possible ceasefire agreements in the Russia-Ukraine war have the potential to lift rates again.Why has this group continued to shine despite lower shipping rates? Two reasons – accelerated earnings growth and relative undervaluation. Historical research has illustrated that roughly half of a stock's future price movement can be attributed to its industry group. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform over the next 3 to 6 months. By focusing on stocks within the top industries, we can provide a constant 'tailwind' to our investing success.Story continuesThe industry also boasts a large number of highly ranked stocks per our Zacks Rank, serving as another confirmation signal that this group is a great place to be. Let's take a deeper look at this leading stock.Company DescriptionInternational Seaways owns and operates a fleet of over 80 oceangoing vessels and is engaged in the global transportation of crude oil and petroleum products. INSW serves independent and state-owned oil companies, oil traders, refinery operators, and international government entities.As we saw in recent weeks with the release of September's CPI data, inflation is going to linger. While the Fed has gone into overdrive with rate hikes, even committee officials have acknowledged that they've done little to stem a 40-year high in inflation. That's good news for shipping companies, as they're able to charge higher rates and pass along the higher costs of doing business.Earnings Trends and Future Estimates INSW has surpassed earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters, delivering a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.31%. The shipping company most recently reported Q2 EPS back in August of $1.43/share, a 17.21% beat over the $1.22 consensus estimate. Consistently beating earnings estimates by a wide margin will generally help boost the stock price over time.Analysts have increased their EPS estimates for INSW across the board. For the third quarter, estimates have been revised upward by 13.85% in the past 30 days. The Q3 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $2.22 per share, translating to astonishing potential growth of 452.37% relative to the same quarter last year.What the Zacks Model Unveils The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) identifies companies that have recently witnessed positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that this more recent information can serve as a better predictor of the future, giving investors a leg up during earnings season. When combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better with a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time according to our 10-year backtest.With an Earnings ESP +3.34% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, another earnings beat may be in the cards for INSW investors when the company reports Q3 results on November 8th.Let's Get TechnicalINSW shares have advanced nearly 180% this year. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to make this type of price move while the market makes a series of lower lows. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages slope up and have acted as support this year throughout the bullish move. The stock has been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, INSW is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, International Seaways has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and INSW continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run. Cautious investors may feel hesitant about investing in a stock that has come this far, but the fact is this elite company is still outperforming.Bottom LineSolid institutional buying should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. With a robust earnings history and an improving future outlook, INSW represents a great opportunity. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is a compelling investment with strong price momentum.Healthy fundamentals combined with a strong technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. Backed by a leading industry group and a lengthy history of earnings beats, it's not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. If you're looking for a way to diversify your portfolio, make sure to put INSW on your shortlist.Bear of the Day:Whirlpool Corporation manufactures and markets home appliances and related products globally. The company's principal products include refrigerators, freezers, ice makers, water filters, laundry appliances, and dishwasher appliances. WHR distributes its products under well-known brands such as Maytag, KitchenAid, Whirlpool, Everydrop, and Royalstar brands. The company sells its products to retailers, distributors, dealers, builders, and directly to consumers.The Zacks RundownWHR has been severely underperforming the market over the past year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, WHR experienced a climax top in May of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The stock is hitting a series of 52-week lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market continues its volatile start to the year.Whirlpool is part of the Zacks Household Appliances industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 9% out of approximately 250 industries. Because this industry is ranked in the bottom half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. The industry has fallen nearly 49% this year, widely underperforming the market.While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in poor-performing industries, their industry association serves as a headwind for any potential rallies. Also note the unfavorable characteristics for this group below:Weak Foundation: Falling Short on Earnings and Deteriorating ForecastsEarnings misses have been a sore spot for WHR lately. The household appliances company most recently reported Q3 earnings results last week of $4.49/share, a -19.68% miss versus the $5.59 consensus estimate. Revenues of $4.78 billion also missed the mark by -8.62%, and WHR has missed on revenue projections for the last five quarters. Consistently missing expectations by a wide margin is a recipe for stock price underperformance.Analysts have revised Q4 earnings estimates down by -8.81% in the past week. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $5.38/share, reflecting negative growth of -12.38% relative to the same quarter last year. Revenues are seen slipping -6.98% to $5.41 billion. These are the types of negative trends that the bears like to see.Technical OutlookWHR stock has been steadily falling since last year and has now established a well-defined downtrend. Shares have declined nearly 40% in the past year, and the stock continues to trade below both moving averages.While not the most accurate indicator, WHR has also experienced what is known as a 'death cross,' wherein the stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. WHR would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock is making a series of lower lows – another good sign for the bears.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop shows that this stock doesn't deserve a spot in the household portfolio. The fact that WHR is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. Falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend.WHR is rated a 'C' in our Zacks Style Score Growth category, indicating more weakness ahead. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy.Additional content:What to Expect from Aerospace Q3 Earnings?The third-quarter 2022 earnings cycle has started for aerospace and defense stocks, with Lockheed Martin reporting better-than-expected earnings. Some major industry players like Boeing, General Dynamics and Teledyne Technologies are set to reveal their Q3 numbers tomorrow.Factors that Influenced Aerospace &amp; Defense StocksGrowing global air travel demand, driven by a steady recovery in the domestic space as well as improving trends observed in international air travel, is expected to significantly boost the Q3 results of aerospace and defense stocks, particularly those engaged in commercial aviation. Evidently, Boeing witnessed a solid year-over-year surge of 31.8% in its commercial shipments during the third quarter.With Boeing the largest jet maker in the nation, we expect the Q3 results of the remaining aerospace majors to reflect a similar improvement in delivery trends. Such solid deliveries must have boosted the overall top-line growth of the Aerospace sector, which houses all aerospace and defense stocks.Stocks in this industry that are more focused on combat must have gained as a result of steady government support. Moreover, a steady order flow observed in the past couple of quarters, along with improving delivery trends in recent times, buoyed by recovering economic trends are projected to have bolstered Q3 revenues of aerospace and defense stocks.However, persistent headwinds like supply chain disruption along with some unfavorable project timing as the result of coronavirus might have an adverse impact on the Q3 bottom line of the industry.Q3 ProjectionsAerospace sector Q3 earnings are expected to slip 0.7% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure, while revenues are projected to improve 8.2%. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through the latest Earnings Preview.Aerospace &amp; Defense Stocks to WatchLet's take a look at three defense companies that are scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 26 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcements.Boeing's third-quarter deliveries reflected a solid 31.8% surge in commercial shipments from the year-ago reported figure, while defense deliveries declined 2.7%. Such mixed delivery numbers from manufacturing companies like Boeing are likely to contribute moderately to the jet maker's overall third-quarter results.Strong cargo markets with several Boeing-converted freighter and materials management agreements must have added an impetus to the company's Q3 revenues. However, the discontinuation of an engine distribution agreement since the second quarter might have impacted BA's government service revenue profile, thereby partly hampering its overall performance in Q3 (read more: Rise in Aftermarket Service to Aid Boeing in Q3 Earnings?).According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boeing currently has an Earnings ESP of -1,900% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.General Dynamics' Q3 results are expected to reflect the solid performance of most of its segments. While increased air travel demand is projected to have boosted Aerospace unit's performance, increased demand volume for shipbuilding is expected to have benefited the Marine Systems segment. Increased revenues from U.S. Stryker wheeled combat vehicles are anticipated to have benefited the Combat Systems unit, while strong order activity might have boosted the performance of the Technologies segment.However, the shortage of chips may have continued to plague the company's ability to deliver certain products in the third quarter as well, thereby partly impacting overall results.General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of -0.41% and a Zacks Rank #3 (read more: Will Segment Sales Aid General Dynamics Q3 Earnings?).Teledyne's Q3 results are likely to reflect solid segmental performance from the majority of its business units. While higher sales of electronic tests and measurement instrumentation, marine instrumentation and environmental instrumentation are projected to have boosted the top line of the Instrumentation segment, the FLIR acquisition along with strong sales growth of the industrial and scientific sensors, cameras and X-ray products must have bolstered the Digital Imaging unit's revenues. Also, higher sales of energy systems amid lower sales of engineered products must have benefited Engineered Systems' performance.Nevertheless, the dual impact of inflation as well as supply-chain constraints might have adversely impacted TDY's soon-to-be-reported quarterly earnings.Teledyne currently has an Earnings ESP of -1.20% and a Zacks Rank #3 (read more: Will Strong Sales Momentum Boost Teledyne's Q3 Earnings?)Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of flow control and compression equipment is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.5%.Revenues are expected to be $1.45 billion, up 9.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.59% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ingersoll?For Ingersoll, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ingersoll will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ingersoll would post earnings of $0.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.54, delivering a surprise of +5.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ingersoll doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, Kadant (KAI) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.10 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +6.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $217.42 million, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Kadant has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.15%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kadant will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

511,00c4adf6-0f0c-3657-8694-ebe926b271aa,SRE,2022-10-27,Sempra (SRE) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sempra-sre-upgraded-buy-does-160004422.html,1666800004,STORY,['SRE'],"[Sempra (SRE) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Sempra basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Sempra imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for SempraThis natural gas and electricity provider is expected to earn $8.64 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2022, which represents a year-over-year change of 2.5%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Sempra. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.9%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Sempra to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

LYB is set to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 28, before the opening bell.LyondellBasell beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters while missing the same twice. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 1.1%, on average. The company posted an earnings surprise of around 4.4% in the last reported quarter. The company’s results in the third quarter are likely to have been impacted by weaker demand and higher energy and raw material costs.Shares of LyondellBasell have declined 14.7% in the past year compared with an 11.8% fall of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. What do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter consolidated sales for LyondellBasell is pegged at $13,279 million, suggesting an increase of around 4.6% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in LyondellBasell’s Olefins &amp; Polyolefins — Americas unit is currently pegged at $3,606 million, suggesting a decline of 18.2% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the Olefins &amp; Polyolefins — Europe, Asia, International segment is currently pegged at $3,151 million, which calls for a decrease of 8.9% year over year.The consensus estimate for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment is pegged at $1,292 million, suggesting a 0.5% year-over-year rise.The consensus mark for sales in the Intermediates and Derivatives segment is currently pegged at $3,413 million, indicating an increase of 17.9% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the Refining segment is currently at $3,253 million, which indicates an increase of 42.2% year over year.The consensus mark for sales in the Technology segment is currently pegged at $188 million, calling for a decline of 21% year over year.Factors at Play in Q3The company is likely to have benefited, in the third quarter, from strong demand for polymers in packaging in the Olefins &amp; Polyolefins — Americas unit. Performance in the Olefins &amp; Polyolefins — EAI unit is expected to have been impacted by softer demand. Pandemic-related lockdowns in China might have also affected results in the quarter.Margins in the Intermediates and Derivatives segment are likely to have hurt in the third quarter on weaker demand for durable goods. The recovery in the automotive market is expected to have supported results in the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. The Refining segment is likely to have benefited from higher demand for transportation fuels.The company is also expected to have witnessed headwinds stemming from higher feedstock and energy costs in the September quarter. Tight supply has led to a spike in energy costs, especially in Europe. Higher associated costs are expected to have exerted pressure on margins in the third quarter.Story continues LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Price and EPS Surprise LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

513,4d5119e2-f3e7-32ec-abaf-1482c3a4635c,VMC,2022-10-27,Vulcan Materials (VMC) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vulcan-materials-vmc-earnings-expected-140202121.html,1666792922,STORY,['VMC'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Vulcan Materials (VMC) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis construction materials company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11%.Revenues are expected to be $2 billion, up 31.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.15% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vulcan?For Vulcan, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.07%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vulcan will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Vulcan would post earnings of $1.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of -7.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Vulcan doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $2.73 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of gypsum wallboard and cement would post earnings of $2.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.82, delivering a surprise of 3.30%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Eagle Materials , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, posted revenues of $605.07 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $509.69 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Eagle Materials shares have lost about 26.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for Eagle Materials?While Eagle Materials has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Eagle Materials: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.30 on $543.56 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.77 on $2.16 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates is currently in the bottom 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Vulcan Materials (VMC), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 2.This construction materials company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Vulcan Materials' revenues are expected to be $2 billion, up 31.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But that can't change the reality that over the longer term (five years), the returns have been really quite dismal. Indeed, the share price is down 55% in the period. So is the recent increase sufficient to restore confidence in the stock? Not yet. But it could be that the fall was overdone.While the stock has risen 3.3% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, General Electric moved from a loss to profitability. On the other hand, it reported a trailing twelve months loss, suggesting it isn't reliably profitable. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.We don't think that the 0.4% is big factor in the share price, since it's quite small, as dividends go. It could be that the revenue decline of 10% per year is viewed as evidence that General Electric is shrinking. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for General Electric in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of General Electric, it has a TSR of -50% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that General Electric shareholders are down 32% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 9% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

The United States has ramped up exports sharply in recent years since the Obama administration ended a 40-year ban in 2015.""That export number is huge. It's the all-time record but that's no surprise"" because of the big discount for U.S. crude to international benchmark Brent, said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. Coming into Wednesday's trade, the discount on U.S. crude was more than $8 per barrel to Brent.Refinery crude runs fell by 114,000 bpd last week, EIA said, dropping refinery utilization rates by 0.6 percentage point to 88.9%.That figure is still seasonally strong, however, as refining facilities run at higher-than-usual levels to meet expected increase in heating oil demand and as overall U.S. capacity has dropped in the last two years. East Coast refiners were running at 102.5% of their stated capacity due to low inventories in the region ahead of the winter months.""East Coast refiners are moving heaven and earth to produce fuels, especially diesel,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York.Valero, the second-largest U.S. crude refiner, says it plans on operating its seven U.S. Gulf Coast refineries at about 95% of capacity through the fourth quarter due to tight supply.Demand was marginally lower this week overall, but gasoline, jet fuel and distillate demand all rose. Over the past four weeks, U.S. refiners are supplying 20.4 million bpd in supply, down 2% from the year-ago period.U.S. gasoline stocks fell by 1.5 million barrels in the week to 207.9 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 170,000 barrels.

527,ecd1c2c4-96fc-3f78-99a0-174d0ecb3825,VLO,2022-10-27,5 Low Leverage Stocks to Buy Amid an Upbeat Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-leverage-stocks-buy-123512152.html,1666787712,STORY,"['PBF', 'VLO', 'EQNR']","[U.S. stocks rallied on Oct 25 as hopes rose that the Federal Reserve might ease off plans for interest rate hikes. Britain’s new prime minister selection is also likely to have boosted investors’ confidence.Against this backdrop, an investor might feel encouraged to buy some stocks. However, before investing blindly in stocks that are offering high returns, one should be aware whether these returns are sustainable. To this end, we recommend stocks like Equinor EQNR, PBF Energy PBF, Amalgamated Financial AMAL, Warrior Met Coal HCC and Valero Energy VLO, which bear low leverage and therefore can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Story continuesAnalyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the third-quarter earnings cycle starting, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 24 stocks that made it through the screen.Equinor: It is one of the premier integrated energy companies in the world, with operations spreading across 30 countries.

UHS reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $2.54 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. However, the bottom line fell 4.9% year over year.UHS’ quarterly results benefited from higher patient admissions at its acute care and behavioral health care facilities. Despite seeing an uptrend, growth in patient volumes in the behavioral health care segment was partly offset by the issue of shortage of nurses and other medical personnel that continues to grapple most U.S. healthcare providers.Consequently, the margins of Universal Health took a hit as it had to incur elevated labor costs in the form of recruiting expensive temporary personnel or raising wages and benefits to attract and retain nurses and other clinical staff to counter the staffing scarcity.Universal Health Services, Inc.

Rick Galloway, Chief Financial Officer of LKQ’s Wholesale - North America and Self Service segments, was appointed as LKQ’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.2022 OutlookRick Galloway, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented: “The business continues to produce strong financial results in a difficult macro-economic environment. We anticipate the benefits associated with our operational excellence programs and capital allocation activities will be more than offset by the weak foreign exchange rates relative to the US dollar along with soft metals prices. Therefore, we have updated our guidance metrics to reflect these current market conditions, and also narrowed our guidance range for the balance of the year.”For 2022, management updated the outlook as set forth below: 2022 Previous Full Year Outlook2022 Updated Full Year OutlookOrganic revenue growth for parts and services4.5% to 6.5%4.75% to 5.75%Diluted EPS2$4.09 to $4.29$4.12 to $4.22Adjusted diluted EPS1,2$3.85 to $4.05$3.85 to $3.95Operating cash flow$1.3 billion$1.25 billionFree cash flow1 minimum $1.0 billionapprox. $1.0 billionFree cash flow conversion of EBITDA155% to 60%55% to 60%Our outlook for the full year 2022 is based on current conditions and recent trends, and assumes current U.S. federal tax legislation remains unchanged, the prices of scrap and precious metals hold near the September average, and no further deterioration due to the Ukraine/Russia conflict. We have applied foreign currency exchange rates near October spot levels, including $0.97 and $1.11 for the euro and pound sterling, respectively, for the balance of the year. Prior guidance issued on July 28, 2022 had currency exchange rate levels of $1.02 and $1.20 for the euro and pound sterling, respectively. Changes in these conditions may impact our ability to achieve the estimates. Adjusted figures exclude (to the extent applicable) the impact of restructuring and transaction related expenses; amortization expense related to acquired intangibles; excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based payments; losses on debt extinguishment; impairment charges; direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict (including provisions for and subsequent adjustments to reserves for asset recoverability and expenditures to support our employees and their families) and gains and losses related to acquisitions or divestitures (including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and the gain on the PGW Auto Glass sale).1 Non-GAAP measure.

537,cf6c3f25-b1d7-3d43-a7b4-d7f6a9daf221,EL,2022-10-27,Analysts Estimate Estee Lauder (EL) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-estee-lauder-el-140102016.html,1666792862,STORY,['EL'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Estee Lauder (EL) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis beauty products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -31.2%.Revenues are expected to be $3.95 billion, down 10.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.44% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Estee Lauder?For Estee Lauder, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Estee Lauder will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Estee Lauder would post earnings of $0.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.42, delivering a surprise of +31.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Estee Lauder doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ADP) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Automatic Data Processing has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Automatic Data Processing will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Automatic Data Processing's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Automatic Data Processing's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 16% gain to the company's bottom line. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 35% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.4% per year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Automatic Data Processing's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On Automatic Data Processing's P/EIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that Automatic Data Processing maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Plus, you should also learn about this   1 warning sign we've spotted with Automatic Data Processing.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

542,90eaf43a-c6f1-36ca-883b-f3a583faf032,PG,2022-10-27,Is The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Trading At A 34% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-company-nyse-pg-120109284.html,1666872069,STORY,['PG'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.9bUS$15.6bUS$16.4bUS$17.8bUS$18.7bUS$19.3bUS$19.9bUS$20.5bUS$21.0bUS$21.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.57%Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.7% US$13.2kUS$14.0kUS$13.9kUS$14.3kUS$14.1kUS$13.8kUS$13.5kUS$13.1kUS$12.7kUS$12.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$135bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (5.7%– 2.0%) = US$586bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$586b÷ ( 1 + 5.7%)10= US$336bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$471b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$132, the company appears quite good value at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Procter &amp; Gamble as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Procter &amp; Gamble, there are three fundamental aspects you should further research:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Procter &amp; Gamble .Future Earnings: How does PG's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

DJIA is down 13.13% year-to-date, but this decline is comparatively less severe than the 19.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of October 24. Some of the most prominent Dow stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The Dow has maintained its individuality by being the price-weighted index in the US stock market. Though the index tracks the performance of just 30 companies, investing in the Dow provides exposure to some of the best names in the market, providing value to beginner investors. Moreover, these industry-leading companies are also favored because of their dividends and yields. Over the years, the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA have shown a strong correlation, however, their performances have branched off in the past. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, the Dow has slightly outperformed the broader market in the last 30 years ending June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, while DJIA returned 11.16%.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:Nearly all companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are dividend players.

Freeland noted that ​​The Bank of Canada's latest rate hikes to control rampant inflation will raise borrowing costs for businesses and consumers alike, which will send tremors of shock through the economy in the near-term. The Bank of Canada, like the United States' Federal Reserve, aims to target price stability and bring inflation down to 2%. This attempt by the central bank could trigger a recession in 2023. While the finance minister said that the government cannot possibly compensate every Canadian who is impacted by the skyrocketing inflation, the most vulnerable people will be helped so they can cover the rising costs of food and rent. Freeland highlighted the passage of Bill C-30, a government legislation to double the GST credit paid to low-income households for a while. Canadian consumer confidence fell to an all-time low apart from the last two economic crises, which increases the likelihood of a recession. Amid a chaotic market environment, notable equities listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange are trading at significant discounts. While investors usually pile into defensive names like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in a volatile market, it is a good idea to jump into some TSX stocks for broader exposure.

It is a diversified financial service company working worldwide, operating through Personal &amp; Commercial Banking, Wealth Management, Insurance, Investor &amp; Treasury Services, and Capital Markets segments. On October 4, Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) announced that it has acquired MDBilling.ca, a cloud-based platform that automates and simplifies medical billing for doctors in Canada. This acquisition advances RBC's existing medical billing firm portfolio.On September 29, Barclays analyst John Aiken reinstated coverage of Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) with an Overweight rating and a C$137 price target after the conclusion of the Brewin Dolphin acquisition. The purchase of the discretionary wealth manager places Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) in the top three asset managers in the U.K. and Ireland, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 12 hedge funds were long Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO), compared to 21 funds in the last quarter. D E Shaw held a notable position in the company, comprising 342,394 shares worth $33 million. In addition to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) is one of the best stocks to consider for a balanced portfolio. Here is what Gator Capital Management has to say about Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY.TO) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“We own a position in Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”) and are completing our due diligence on several other Canadian banks. Royal Bank is the #1 bank in Canada. It has a business mix similar to JP Morgan Chase (“JPM”) with strong retail and corporate banking businesses. It also has a significant investment banking and asset management business. From here, we believe Canadian bank stocks will generate attractive returns for shareholders in the medium and long term.Here is more detail on our investment thesis for Royal Bank of Canada: Bank with consistently high returns – RBC consistently posts Return on Tangible Common Equity (“ROTCE”) in the low 20%. In contrast, JPM has reported ROTCE between 12% and 19% over the last six years. We think this reflects the higher margins of the Canadian banking system. Leading bank in Canada – RBC is the leading bank in Canada. It has the highest returns, the highest market share, and the highest valuation of the five major Canadian banks. We believe other stock market investors will favor RBC when Canadian banks regain favor. Low relative valuation to US Banks – Canadian banks have had premium valuations compared to US banks for a few decades due to their higher and more consistent returns. Over the last 10 years, this valuation premium has almost disappeared. The chart below shows the price-to-tangible book ratio (“P/TB”) of RBC compared to JPM’s. As you can see, in 2011 RBC traded at 3x P/TB while JPM traded at 1x. Now, both banks trade at 2.5x P/TB. Strong growth at City National – RBC’s US Subsidiary, City National Bank, is growing very quickly. RBC purchased City National in 2015. City National was an LA-based bank focused on high-net-worth customers. At the time of the purchase, City National had already expanded and gained traction in San Francisco and New York. Now, City National has branches in Washington, DC, Atlanta, Miami, Dallas, Minneapolis, San Diego, and Las Vegas. City National has a banking strategy similar to that of First Republic and is growing at a comparable rate. We would note that First Republic trades at 26x 2021 estimated earnings.

If you want to see more of the best global dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Given several decades of rising globalization, many leading American companies do business around the world. Leading companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) sell Windows in the United States, Europe, and China, for example.The leading companies have gone global to try to increase their market sizes. With larger market sizes, companies have more potential consumers, and more potential revenue opportunities. With more potential revenue, there's potential for more profits.Helping with this process is that many markets enjoy close ties with the United States. Major countries in Europe, for example, have been allies with the United States for many decades. Even countries like China have had strong relations with the United States such that trade between the two country amounted to almost $560 billion in total two way trade in 2020. The close ties makes doing business easier and helps facilitate the flow of capital.Another reason for many American companies doing business globally is the U.S. dollar. Given the U.S dollar is the dominant global reserve currency, many emerging countries want it to develop and the U.S. dollar generally goes further in terms of purchasing power as a result in the emerging countries. As a result, leading U.S. companies that expand in emerging markets can often do it more cheaply because the U.S. dollar has more purchasing power.Lastly, many leading U.S. companies go global because there is often less competition in emerging markets than in the U.S. market. With less competition, it's easier to gain market share and to make profits.2022 has been a challenging year in the markets given the higher inflation, the interest rate hikes by the Fed, and the Ukraine Russian war. As a result of the headwinds, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 19.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has fallen 29.3% year to date.Story continuesGiven the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the dividend sector, here are 10 stocks that are global in terms of their operations and that also have an attractive dividend to consider.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now, we took 10 stocks with substantial earnings power that had global operations and also paid a dividend.

(NYSE:PFE) is also a dividend stock as well. If Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) exceeds expectations in terms of innovation, both the world and stock holders could benefit.Alongside Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also a global dividend stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the second quarter.9.

(NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is also pretty global given it sells its pharmaceuticals in the U.S., EU, Japan, China, and elsewhere.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has also been a pretty strong performer in terms of its stock. While the broader market has declined substantially in 2022, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stock has risen over 27% year to date. Shares are near an all time high as analysts expect Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) earnings per share to grow substantially in the future. If EPS grows, the company's dividend could grow too.

Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”8.

(NYSE:NKE)'s recent headwinds in a Q3 2022 letter,“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) (-18.4%): The company spent most of the quarter trading about in line with the overall market. But on the last day of the quarter, they reported earnings that demonstrated strong consumer demand, but a series of geographic and product level inventory level issues. Given the start-stop nature of their production during COVID, strained global supply chains, and China consumers popping in and out of lockdowns, the company ended up with too much apparel inventory and announced they’d be slashing prices on certain items to reset inventory to appropriate levels quickly.”While NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has headwinds, the stock nevertheless has potential earnings growth potential in the future given the increasing global population and rising global wealth.As of 10/25, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares have a dividend yield of 1.33% and a payout ratio of 33.2%. With the relatively low payout ratio, NIKE, Inc.

A Fidelity report also mentioned that adjusted P/E ratios of non-US stocks were lower than those of the S&amp;P 500 in the second half of 2022, which means that foreign stocks are good value for money and can also offer attractive returns.As 40-year high inflation has taken a toll on global stock markets, analysts recommend investing in dividend companies as they endure periods of stagflation better than their peers. According to a report by JPMorgan, high-quality dividend companies with long tracks of dividend growth resist cutting their dividends in recognition of slow earnings. In this case, these companies are expected to report higher payout ratios during recessionary periods. However, payout ratios this year are currently at low levels as dividends have just recovered from the pandemic of 2020. Some notable dividend stocks that investors are paying attention to include American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).

It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”9.

Green hydrogen, made by using renewable energy to split water into its basic elements, hydrogen and oxygen, and subsequently cleanly burn the hydrogen as fuel, is seen as key to lowering emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries such as steel and cement, as well as transport. In 2021 Linde announced a long-term agreement to provide European semiconductor maker Infineon (OTCQX:IFNNY) with onsite production and storage of green hydrogen for the company’s site in Villach, Austria.

Here is what the firm has to say:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multi-national companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”7. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Dividend Yield as of October 25: 4.22%Another best foreign stock on our list is Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) which is a British multinational consumer goods company. In the past five years, the company has raised its dividends at a CAGR of 4.63%.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Multinational consumer goods company Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) showed robust price increases overall, with minimal impact on volume, resulting in faster-than-expected sales growth during the quarter. Indeed, higher inflation can be a positive change for companies with favorable brands like Unilever as these conditions make it easier for the biggest brands to raise prices, continue spending on advertising, and take share. We believe the appointment of an activist investor to Unilever’s board in June will help spur additional growth.”6.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned -0.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which P&amp;G falls in, has lost 1.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.58 per share, indicating a change of -4.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.5%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.27 indicates a change of +7.3% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&amp;G is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate of $20.65 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.4%. The $79.71 billion and $82.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.6% and +4.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. EPS of $1.57 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.77%. The EPS surprise was +1.29%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Analysts had expected the figure to dip by 2.8%.A similar decrease was recently seen by Reckitt's peers Procter&amp;Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Nestle (OTC:NSRGY), potentially suggesting that a spike in inflation is leading many consumers to rein in expenditures.""We expect investors to focus on any further signs of weakening in discretionary spend across the portfolio,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.Despite these worries, Reckitt still saw like-for-like net revenues expand by 7.4% to £3.7B, above consensus expectations for growth of 6.1%. Reckitt attributed the increase to a 12% improvement in price/mix, which helps gauge the impact of price rises across its various products.Meanwhile, the company also narrowed its guidance range for annual like-for-like net revenue to 6% - 8%, down from its previous band of 5% to 8%.

This increase was primarily attributable to growth in revenue from Same-Store communities and past accretive external growth investments.""Blended lease rate growth of 13.1 percent in the third quarter drove strong sequential same-store revenue growth of 4.7 percent on a straight-line basis and further builds our foundation of embedded growth in 2023,"" said Mike Lacy, UDR’s Senior Vice President of Operations. ""Focusing on rate growth and accepting a higher rate of turnover and slightly lower occupancy reflects our strategy to strengthen our rent roll. Although expenses are pressured by inflation and the typical seasonality of market rents has returned in the fourth quarter thus far, traffic remains high and the financial health of our residents remains strong. This has enabled us to keep occupancy high at 96.7 percent while capturing October blended lease rate growth in the high-single-digits, which remains materially above pre-COVID averages.""With stronger collections in recent periods, the Company now expects current resident collections to range between 98.2 percent and 98.6 percent in 2022, compared to prior expectations of 98.0 percent to 98.5 percent. For the third quarter 2022, the Company recorded a residential bad debt reserve of $11.7 million, including $0.6 million for the Company’s share from unconsolidated joint ventures, a decrease of $1.1 million versus the Company’s bad debt reserve as of the end of the second quarter 2022. This compares to a quarter-end accounts receivable balance of $20.8 million, a decrease of $2.0 million versus the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of the end of the second quarter 2022.In the table below, the Company has presented YOY Same-Store results by region, with concessions accounted for on both cash and straight-line bases.Summary of Same-Store Results in Third Quarter 2022 versus Third Quarter 2021RegionRevenueGrowthExpenseGrowthNOIGrowth% of Same-StorePortfolio(1)PhysicalOccupancy(2)YOY Change inOccupancyWest9.3%5.8%10.6%33.7%96.7%(0.8)%Mid-Atlantic8.7%6.3%9.8%20.8%96.8%(0.4)%Northeast16.5%3.0%25.6%18.1%97.1%(0.1)%Southeast18.1%10.7%22.0%12.9%96.7%(1.2)%Southwest14.9%15.6%14.5%9.0%96.7%(1.2)%Other Markets9.4%8.7%9.7%5.5%96.8%(1.0)%Total (Cash)12.2%7.2%14.6%100.0%96.8%(0.7)%Total (Straight-Line)12.7%7.2%15.5%---(1)Based on 3Q 2022 Same-Store NOI.

As a result, the Company purchased the loan from the lender pursuant to a contract entered into with the lender at the time UDR made its initial investment, and initiated foreclosure proceedings.

""Third quarter net debt-to-EBITDAre of 6.0x declined more than a full turn versus a year ago, and we continue to expect that year-end net debt-to-EBITDAre and fixed charge coverage should further improve to the mid-5x range.""During the quarter, the Company settled approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock under its previously announced forward equity sales agreements at a weighted average net share price, after adjustments, of $57.00 for proceeds of approximately $99.8 million.Additionally, during the quarter, the Company repurchased 685 thousand shares of its common stock at a weighted average price per share of $41.46 for total consideration of approximately $28.4 million.

AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO enables investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not always be comparable to AFFO calculated by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. A reconciliation from net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders to AFFO is provided on Attachment 2.Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items as Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items divided by total consolidated interest, excluding the impact of costs associated with debt extinguishment, plus preferred dividends.Management considers Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation of the components that comprise Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items as Consolidated EBITDAre – adjusted for non-recurring items divided by total consolidated interest, excluding the impact of costs associated with debt extinguishment.Management considers Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation of the components that comprise Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items as total consolidated debt net of cash and cash equivalents divided by annualized Consolidated EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items. Consolidated EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items is defined as EBITDAre excluding the impact of income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities, adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures and other non-recurring items including, but not limited to casualty-related charges/(recoveries), net of wholly owned communities.Management considers Consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation between net income/(loss) and Consolidated EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Controllable Expenses: The Company refers to property operating and maintenance expenses as Controllable Expenses.Controllable Operating Margin: The Company defines Controllable Operating Margin as (i) rental income less Controllable Expenses (ii) divided by rental income. Management considers Controllable Operating Margin a useful metric as it provides investors with an indicator of the Company’s ability to limit the growth of expenses that are within the control of the Company.Development Communities: The Company defines Development Communities as those communities recently developed or under development by the Company, that are currently majority owned by the Company and have not achieved stabilization as of the most recent quarter.Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre): The Company defines EBITDAre as net income/(loss) (computed in accordance GAAP), plus interest expense, including costs associated with debt extinguishment, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, plus other depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) income tax provision/(benefit), net, (minus) plus net gain/(loss) on the sale of depreciable real estate owned, plus impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus the adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the Nareit definition, or that interpret the Nareit definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre was approved by the Board of Governors of Nareit in September 2017.Management considers EBITDAre a useful metric for investors as it provides an additional indicator of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt, and enables investors to assess our performance against that of its peer REITs. EBITDAre should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the Company’s activities in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAre does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. A reconciliation between net income/(loss) and EBITDAre is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth: The Company defines Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth as the combined proportional growth as a result of Effective New Lease Rate Growth and Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth. Management considers Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth a useful metric for investors as it assesses combined proportional market-level, new and in-place demand trends.Effective New Lease Rate Growth: The Company defines Effective New Lease Rate Growth as the increase in gross potential rent realized less concessions for the new lease term (current effective rent) versus prior resident effective rent for the prior lease term on new leases commenced during the current quarter.Management considers Effective New Lease Rate Growth a useful metric for investors as it assesses market-level new demand trends.Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth: The Company defines Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth as the increase in gross potential rent realized less concessions for the new lease term (current effective rent) versus prior effective rent for the prior lease term on renewed leases commenced during the current quarter.Management considers Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth a useful metric for investors as it assesses market-level, in-place demand trends.Estimated Quarter of Completion: The Company defines Estimated Quarter of Completion of a development or redevelopment project as the date on which construction is expected to be completed, but it does not represent the date of stabilization.Attachment 15(B)UDR, Inc.Definitions and ReconciliationsSeptember 30, 2022(Unaudited)Funds from Operations as Adjusted (""FFO as Adjusted"") attributable to common stockholders and unitholders: The Company defines FFO as Adjusted attributable to common stockholders and unitholders as FFO excluding the impact of other non-comparable items including, but not limited to, acquisition-related costs, prepayment costs/benefits associated with early debt retirement, impairment write-downs or gains and losses on sales of real estate or other assets incidental to the main business of the Company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses, casualty-related expenses and recoveries, severance costs and legal and other costs.Management believes that FFO as Adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other REITs. FFO as Adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO as Adjusted. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures and, accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not always be comparable to FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures calculated by other REITs. FFO as Adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity. A reconciliation from net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO as Adjusted is provided on Attachment 2.Funds from Operations (""FFO"") attributable to common stockholders and unitholders: The Company defines FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders as net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the Company or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are directly attributable to decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the Company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and the Company’s share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust's definition issued in April 2002 and restated in November 2018. In the computation of diluted FFO, if OP Units, DownREIT Units, unvested restricted stock, unvested LTIP Units, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive, they are included in the diluted share count.Management considers FFO a useful metric for investors as the Company uses FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the Company's activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. A reconciliation from net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO is provided on Attachment 2.Held For Disposition Communities: The Company defines Held for Disposition Communities as those communities that were held for sale as of the end of the most recent quarter.Joint Venture Reconciliation at UDR's weighted average ownership interest:In thousands3Q 2022YTD 2022Income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities$10,003$4,186Management fee6271,680Interest expense3,92111,351Depreciation7,45722,570General and administrative57168Variable upside participation on DCP, net-(10,622)Developer Capital Program (excludes Menifee and Riverside)(13,274)(28,627)Other (income)/expense136301Realized (gain)/loss on real estate technology investments, net of tax365(1,987)Unrealized (gain)/loss on real estate technology investments, net of tax1,08030,786Total Joint Venture NOI at UDR's Ownership Interest$10,372$29,806Net Operating Income (""NOI""): The Company defines NOI as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental income represents gross market rent and other revenues less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense, which is calculated as 3.25% of property revenue, and land rent. Property management expense covers costs directly related to consolidated property operations, inclusive of corporate management, regional supervision, accounting and other costs.Management considers NOI a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporate-level expense allocations, general and administrative costs, capital structure and depreciation and amortization and is a widely used input, along with capitalization rates, in the determination of real estate valuations.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. ACR, UDR, Inc. UDR, Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. BNL and Seabridge Gold Inc. SA.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Gain from Stubbornly High InflationConsumer prices in the United States advanced to a 40-year high last month. Elevated inflation, thus, continues to squeeze household outlays and adversely impact economic growth. In fact, the core consumer price index (CPI), which eliminates food and energy prices climbed 6.6% in September from the year-ago period, its highest 12-month jump since 1982, per the U.S. Labor Department.By the way, the CPI accelerated 8.2% last month on a year-over-year basis. This marks a slight dip from the peak of about 9% in June. Yet, it continues to hover near the highest levels since the 1980s.To top it, wholesale prices too climbed northward despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame the relentless rise in prices of indispensable goods and services. The producer price index (PPI) increased 0.4% month over month in September, while the core PPI too advanced by 0.4%.No doubt, multiple causes can be attributed to the current high inflation rate. Initially, during the pandemic, consumers were spending less and saving more. However, once the pandemic eased, consumers started to spend more. But companies couldn't fulfill such household demand amid supply chain disruptions caused due to the pandemic.As a result, prices of a wide range of commodities and services jacked up. Additionally, geopolitical issues, including the Russia-Ukraine war coupled with a strong labor market, led to an increase in the inflation rate.Now, high inflation has compelled the Fed to adopt aggressive monetary measures. The Fed hiked interest rates considerably to curb inflation, a move that doesn't bode well for the broader economy vis-à-vis the stock market. But it's also true that there are some stocks that actually tend to gain from high inflation.Story continuesPrimarily, property prices scale upward with an increase in inflation. Moreover, as the value of the property increases, rent levied by landlords increases over time. Similarly, gold doesn't seem to lose its value amid inflationary pressures. Demand for gold, including other precious metals, improves when inflation rises.From an investment perspective, thus, real estate can be purchased by investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT), while gold can be acquired by investments in gold mining stocks. Hence, stocks such as ACRES Commercial Realty Corp., UDR, Inc, Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. and Seabridge Gold Inc. are poised to gain from a rise in inflation. These stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

561,9d123150-8af8-3abd-86d4-e27c271189df,ETN,2022-10-27,Emerson Electric (EMR) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/emerson-electric-emr-reports-next-140202811.html,1666792922,STORY,"['EMR', 'ETN']","[Emerson Electric (EMR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of process controls systems, valves and analytical instruments is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.9%.Revenues are expected to be $5.34 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.36% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Emerson Electric?For Emerson Electric, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.81%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Emerson Electric will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Emerson Electric would post earnings of $1.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.38, delivering a surprise of +6.98%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Emerson Electric appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerEaton (ETN), another stock in the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.01 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +14.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.32 billion, up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Eaton has been revised 0.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.38%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eaton will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The project also adds four new rail spurs at the existing manufacturing site and leaves another 200,000 square feet available for future expansion at the distribution site.The Sherwin-Williams Company Logo (PRNewsfoto/The Sherwin-Williams Company)""Today marks an important milestone for Sherwin-Williams in continuing to serve our customers and investing in our employees,"" said John G. Morikis, Sherwin-Williams Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""This project will support our growth for years to come. We are proud to be a part of the community here and grateful for the partnership we have with the local and state officials.""State, county and local public officials, Sherwin-Williams employees, as well as project contractors and partners attended the ceremonial groundbreaking to celebrate the beginning of the project, which is expected to be complete by the end of 2024.Together, the facility upgrades will add millions of gallons of annual manufacturing capacity and sizable pallet storage capacity to support the Company in meeting increasing demand for its architectural paint and coatings products. Sherwin-Williams plans to invest a minimum of $300 million in the project and add more than 180 full-time jobs at the site over the next three years, which would essentially double the existing workforce.The Company announced in February that it signed an agreement with the state of North Carolina, Iredell County and the City of Statesville to significantly expand its architectural paint and coatings manufacturing capacity and establish a larger distribution facility in Statesville, North Carolina.Sherwin-Williams looked at multiple locations for potential expansion opportunities in a competitive vetting process before selecting the Statesville facility. The Statesville facility was chosen for its transportation infrastructure, the strength of the current workforce and depth of the local talent pool, the facility's ability to handle additional capacity, and a location that provides for the centralization of existing distribution opportunities for the Company's regional operations.Story continues""This project in Statesville adds to North Carolina's reputation as a top workforce location for modern manufacturing,"" said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. ""With more than 2,400 full-time Sherwin-Williams employees in our state and more coming, our state is committed to the education and training that will create success for years to come.""Additionally, Sherwin-Williams will receive approximately $30 million in state, county and local government incentives toward the project. This investment reflects the strength of the public-private partnership between Sherwin-Williams and the state of North Carolina, Iredell County and the City of Statesville and underscores the Company's confidence in the region and its people.""We are thrilled Sherwin-Williams, a company that has been an integral part of our community since 1993, chose to make a significant investment in Statesville for both its manufacturing and distribution facilities,"" said City of Statesville Mayor Costi Kutteh. ""The decision to expand their footprint here represents the largest paint manufacturing operation for the company in North America based upon total gallon capacity and the largest single investment in the history of our city.""ABOUT THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANYFounded in 1866, The Sherwin-Williams Company is a global leader in the manufacture, development, distribution, and sale of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial, and retail customers.

However, the bottom line fell 4.9% year over year.UHS’ quarterly results benefited from higher patient admissions at its acute care and behavioral health care facilities. Despite seeing an uptrend, growth in patient volumes in the behavioral health care segment was partly offset by the issue of shortage of nurses and other medical personnel that continues to grapple most U.S. healthcare providers.Consequently, the margins of Universal Health took a hit as it had to incur elevated labor costs in the form of recruiting expensive temporary personnel or raising wages and benefits to attract and retain nurses and other clinical staff to counter the staffing scarcity.Universal Health Services, Inc.

In 2018 Freeport handed 51% of Grasberg to state-owned miner PT Inalum, ending years of fractious negotiations as Jakarta pushed for greater control over its mineral wealth, but remaining the mine's operator.""We are working with the Indonesian government about potentially extending our rights to operate Grasberg beyond 2041,"" Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told Reuters on the sidelines of the LME Week conference in London.""These are early stage discussions, but we have a long term view,"" he added.Freeport, which pledged a $14 billion investment in the mine in 2018, is in the process of building a copper smelter in the country and is expanding the mine in what is becoming the world's largest underground mining complex.Despite copper prices falling 20% this year so far, demand for the metal is expected to be strong in the long term due to the green energy transition. Freeport last week posted a sharp drop in quarterly profit that nevertheless beat Wall Street's weak expectations as copper demand stayed strong.""Demand has continued, but prices have declined anticipating that it will fall off,"" Adkerson said.Uncertainty about the global economy, driven in part by the Russia-Ukraine war and an energy crisis in Europe drove Freeport to drop capital expenditure by well over 10% for the year.As part of its effort to mitigate the financial impact of declining copper prices, Phoenix-based Freeport is looking at what projects it should prioritize, President Kathleen Quirk said in the interview. ""We are not cancelling things, but the time might shift,"" she said.Adkerson and Quirk reiterated long-standing comments that Freeport does not need to buy a rival to grow, pointing to expansion plans in the United States and Grasberg.

Here's what the firm said:“We had the opportunity to purchase BorgWarner for a high single-digit multiple of our estimate of normal earnings due to elevated cyclical concerns and uncertainty about the longer term impact of powertrain electrification on the business. Currently, the company’s earnings are depressed due to semiconductor supply constraints that are impacting the entire industry. We expect these constraints to prove transitory, and we’re confident that component shortages will be resolved in the coming years. Furthermore, we believe that OEMs are likely to rely heavily on third-party suppliers, like BorgWarner, to leverage R&amp;D expenses to enhance innovation and speed-to-market in an electrified world. For decades, we’ve been impressed with how BorgWarner management has successfully acquired and scaled fuel efficiency technologies for internal combustion engines. We see strong parallels and underappreciated potential in the acquisitions the company has made over the past 5+ years in key electric vehicle technologies. We believe the company is well-positioned to manufacture and integrate new propulsion systems and components to meet customer demands.”BorgWarner Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PepsiCoIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo Beverages North America, Kirk Tanner, sold US$2.4m worth of shares at a price of US$175 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$178, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 13% of Kirk Tanner's holding.PepsiCo insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like PepsiCo better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.PepsiCo Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at PepsiCo. In total, insiders dumped US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of PepsiCoFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. PepsiCo insiders own about US$348m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PepsiCo Insiders?Insiders sold PepsiCo shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since PepsiCo is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PepsiCo. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with PepsiCo and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Of course PepsiCo may not be the best stock to buy.

The Quest Diagnostics Foundation and Green Bronx Machine are providing a group of children the opportunity to share in that experience with a donation of the Tower Gardens® aeroponic growing system for growing and harvesting their own food.Students at Westbrooke Village Elementary School in Trotwood, Ohio, will grow, care for, harvest, and prepare delicious, wholesome food while learning about (and addressing) food insecurity, food access, and healthy living in their own communities.

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 3.19%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.58%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Cisco Systems as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 16, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.84, up 2.44% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $13.32 billion, up 3.28% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.53 per share and revenue of $54.08 billion, which would represent changes of +5.06% and +4.89%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Cisco Systems should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Cisco Systems is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Cisco Systems currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.56. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 17.25, so we one might conclude that Cisco Systems is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that CSCO has a PEG ratio of 1.93 right now.
