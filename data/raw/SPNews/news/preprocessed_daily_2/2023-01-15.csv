However, the report presented a skeptical view on global growth due to the re-emergence of Covid in China and the ongoing natural gas crisis in Europe. In the current market situation, investors expect defensive value stocks to hold the reins this year as recession fears will continue to haunt the stock market.Over the years, high-quality growth stocks outperformed value equities. However, with the tech sell-off last year, value investing gained traction among investors. In Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in the first week of January 2023, 54% of respondents mentioned that they are inclined to invest more in value stocks this year, up from 39% three months ago. Another survey by CNBC revealed that 72% of the participants will prefer value over growth this year. Last year’s returns also showed the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In 2022, the Russell 1000 Value Index fell by 7.5%, compared with a much harsh decline of 29.1% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Analysts expect the value investing trend to continue this year as well. Sarah Ketterer, a chief executive of Causeway Capital Management, spoke to The Street about the investment outlook in 2023. She asserted that stable interest rates would bode well for value stocks. She also mentioned that while investing in value stocks, investors should also consider the return on capital like dividends and buybacks.Dividend stocks also reported strong performance in 2022 as investors preferred income-generating stocks. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed over $561 billion in dividends last year, up from $511.2 billion in 2021, as reported by Wall Street Journal.

1,58036b2b-08b3-38c2-8fd6-dd96e61d2364,TMO,2023-01-15,Thermo Fisher Scientific's (NYSE:TMO) five-year earnings growth trails the splendid shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientifics-nyse-tmo-120026043.html,1673784026,STORY,['TMO'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 173% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 13% gain in the last three months. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 11% in 90 days).After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Thermo Fisher Scientific achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 25% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 22% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Thermo Fisher Scientific's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Thermo Fisher Scientific the TSR over the last 5 years was 177%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Thermo Fisher Scientific returned a loss of 1.6% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 15%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 23%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Undervalued Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy.Mid-cap companies are some of the most attractive investment vehicles that have proven their mettle over the past few years. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, the S&amp;P MidCap 400 index has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 index for most of the past 20 years through 2015. The report says that mid-cap companies sit at a sweet spot between small caps and large caps. These companies are out of the volatility faced by small caps but have the growth potential that large caps lack. The report said that small-cap stocks have consistently outperformed large-cap stocks for most of the time frames discussed in the study, except July 1991 to March 2000, when the performance spread was negligible.Another important report by Wespath discussed the outperformance of mid-cap stocks. The report quotes a research paper by Nobel economics laureate Eugene Fama and co-author Ken French. These experts studied equities for a period starting from 1926 through 1992. The results of this research showed that over long term, small- and mid-cap stocks “consistently” outperform large-cap stocks.The Wespath report also talks about the reasons of the outperformance of small- and mid-cap stocks. Why these stocks outperform large-cap stocks over a long-term time window? Part of the reason could be the type of industries these companies operate in. Most of the mid- and small-cap companies operate in high-growth areas like software, biotech and robotics.The report also quoted an important paper published by AQR Capital Management in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2018. This paper analyzed stock returns posted in 1926 through 2012. The research found the outperformance of mid- and small-cap stocks exists especially when controlling for quality. Quality here is defined by financial data such as earnings stability, profitability, profit growth and low debt levels. That’s why in this article we will talk about some quality mid-cap stocks that are undervalued and have long-term growth potential.Story continuesOther key advantage investors enjoy while investing in mid-cap stocks is their affordable price. Since mid-cap companies have market caps between $2 billion to $10 billion, these companies don’t have exorbitantly high stock prices, as you will see in this article. These companies, if chosen wisely, offer higher upside and growth potential when compared to large-cap stocks which have, in many cases, already rewarded their early investors.Our MethodologyFor this article, we first screened for stocks that have a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion, PE ratio under 15 and PEG ratio under 1 as of January 12.

One of the most recent, startling headlines in this category came from Goldman Sachs, which predicted that even the eurozone would not suffer a recession this year. If the eurozone, which has been hit with far worse inflationary shocks than the U.S., is worried about a huge war near its border and has an unemployment rate that is close to double America’s is not going to experience a recession, I can’t understand how the U.S. is going to have one.Also in the shocking category was a prediction by Morgan Stanley’s Chief Economist that the American economy would grow by 0.5% this year. That’s pretty amazing because it seems that the most famous, current prognosticator of doom and gloom on the Street is Morgan Stanley’s Chief U.S. Equity Strategist, Mike Wilson. So even a colleague of the Street’s foremost bear is calling for the American economy to expand this year.

BODY is very well-positioned to benefit from that trend.Story continuesMoreover, the stock’s valuation is exceptionally tiny, as the shares are trading for just 0.2 times the company’s trailing sales. And finally, the Street was apparently very pleasantly surprised by the company’s recent reiteration of its fourth-quarter guidance, as BODY stock responded to the news by rocketing 25% higher on Jan. 10.For Q4, the company expects its revenue to come in at $140 million to $150 million.In a comprehensive review of Beachbody’s 645, at-home fitness program, SI.com wrote that it will ” help you strengthen your lower body, upper body and core, it aims to build muscle and improve mobility throughout your entire bod as one big unit, preparing you for those daily life tasks that rely so heavily on functionality.”The website added that the program is fun, and SI.com did not have any major criticisms of the offering.MGM (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comIn several recent articles, I’ve recommended MGM (NYSE:MGM) stock, contending that the casino owner is very well-positioned to benefit from Las Vegas’ current and upcoming popularity.On Jan. 6, investment bank Stifel expressed similar sentiments about Las Vegas and MGM stock, as the firm upgraded its rating on MGM stock to “buy” from “hold.”The investment bank stated that “At this point we believe the LV Strip momentum should easily continue through 2023 and into 2024 and we see more value with Macau/LV Strip operators versus pure play regional gaming operators.”Like me, the firm expects MGM to get a major boost from increased business travel to the city this year. Other positive catalysts for the stock include the reopening of MGM’s casinos in China and its superior customer data, Stifel contended.Moreover, as I’ve pointed out previously, MGM expects its sports betting venture, BetMGM, to start generating positive EBITDA this year.And MGM stock currently has momentum on its side, as the shares jumped 9.3% in the five trading days that ended on Jan. 10.EVgo (EVGO)EVgo fast charging stationSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSome may oppose my decision to include electric-vehicle charger operator EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) on this list of seven consumer discretionary stocks to buy. However, buying EVs, which tend to be more expensive than their gasoline-powered counterparts, is definitely a discretionary decision, and chargers are often used on long trips, many of which are discretionary. As a result, I decided to incorporate EVGO into this column.I’ve long believed that the company, which says it has “more than 850 fast-charging statins” in the U.S., would get a big boost from the rapid proliferation of EVs. As a result, I bought the stock in 2021.And the company — which has established a close partnership with emerging EV powerhouse General Motors (NYSE:GM) — reported that its revenue jumped 70% year-over-year last quarter to $10.5 million, as it gained “approximately 54,000 new customer accounts” and the amount of electricity it provided soared 51% year-over-year.But the stock tumbled from $12.75 in March 2022 to below $4 at the end of last year.However, in a recent note to investors, investment bank MKM Partners indicated that the plunge of EVGO stock is not based on fundamentals.The firm says that a “wall of worry” among investors has been heavily weighing on the stocks of companies that, like EVgo, merged with SPACs. As a result, many names that became public by combining with stocks, including EVGO, are undervalued, MKM contended, adding that EVGO stock is ” a can’t miss.”I agree with MKM’s points, and so did many other investors, apparently, as the shares shot up 23% following the publication of the firm’s note.Moreover, 33% of EVGO’s shares are being sold short, making it an excellent candidate for a short squeeze.DoorDash (DASH)Close up of Doordash (DASH) logo and symbol displayed at the entrance to one of their officesSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIn a December note to investors, Goldman Sachs reported that food delivery had become “more normative” during the pandemic and that the trend could expand further going forward.It identified DoorDash (NYSE:DASH), the largest, pure-play food delivery company, as one of the names that could benefit significantly from the proliferation of the food delivery phenomenon.In addition, it is worth noting is that, in the third quarter, despite the curtailment of the pandemic, DoorDash’s revenue soared 34% year-over-year, while its total orders climbed 27% YOY and its cash flow from operations came in at an impressive $199 million, nearly double the $107 million of cash flow from operations that it generated during the same period a year earlier.DASH trades at a relatively low forward price-sales ratio of just 2.3 times, and nearly 9% of the shares are sold short, making it a relatively good candidate for a short squeeze going forward.Booking Holdings (BKNG)a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphoneSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comAnother key post-pandemic trend is increased spending on travel, Goldman Sachs wrote in its December note. The travel companies that are able to effectively use marketing to promote their travel offerings will probably gain the most market share, the firm predicted.That should leave Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), which owns many of the most popular online travel agencies, very well-positioned going forward. That’s because many travel companies will probably spend a great deal of money on their websites to exploit the travel boom.And as I noted in a December column, “in the third quarter, the number of hotel rooms rented through [BKNG] climbed about 8% versus Q3 of 2019, while the value of its gross bookings soared 27% versus the same period in 2019.” Moreover, George Soros, the highly successful billionaire investor, purchased 10,000 shares of the stock in Q3.BKNG has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 18.6 times.General Motors (GM)Image of the new GM logo on a smartphone with cars in the background.Source: Formatoriginal / Shutterstock.comAfter U.S. gasoline prices fell tremendously in the last few months, I believe that General Motors (NYSE:GM) is benefiting from “revenge buying” of SUVs and pickup trucks in the country.Moreover, the number of vehicles that it sold in the U.S. soared 41% year-over-year to 623,000 last year. Interestingly, last year GM sold more vehicles than any other automaker in the U.S. last year.And as Seeking Alpha explained, the automaker “credited full-size pickups and full-size SUV segments for the strong performance as these categories made up over half of the total sales for the full year.GM noted that it is now selling nine EV models, giving it the opportunity to expand its market share in the category.Furthermore, GM sold a record 16,266 EVs in Q4, and its EV sales should greatly increase this year as it produces 70,000 of its popular Bolt EVs, launches additional EV models, such as the electric version of its Silverado pickup, and consumers become more familiar with its other, existing EV offerings, including the Hummer and the Cadillac Lyriq.Shake Shack (SHAK)A Shake Shack (SHAK) restaurant in Tokyo, Japan.Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.comA very popular U.S. gourmet hamburger chain, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), reported its preliminary fourth quarter and full-year results on Jan. 10.The company stated that its sales had jumped to $238.5 million. Moreover, its same-store sales climbed 5.1% last quarter and 7.8% in the full year.Meanwhile, SHAK believes that its restaurant-level operating margin came in at a very strong 19% last quarter.Speaking on CNBC yesterday, the channel’s contributor, Josh Brown, who’s also an investment manager, stated that SHAK’s strong Q4 results show that it’s pleasing its customers. And I agree with that assessment.Additionally, I believe that the company is benefiting from a post-pandemic boom in restaurant spending and much stronger middle-class and upper-class consumer spending than Wall Street expects.Finally, every time I’ve gone to Shake Shack restaurants, they have been very crowded.SHAK stock has a rather low trailing price-sales ratio of 2.1 times.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in MGM and EVGO.

This comes despite headwinds such as a stall in those talks and competition from discounted Russian crude.Energy consultant SVB International said Iran's crude exports in December averaged 1.137 million barrels per day, up 42,000 bpd from November and the highest 2022 figure SVB has reported based on estimates given earlier.""In comparison to the Trump administration, there hasn't been any serious crackdown or action against Iran's oil exports,"" said Sara Vakhshouri of SVB.

The Treasury Department imposed sanctions late last year on an oil smuggling ring linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).Story continuesConsultant Petro-Logistics, which tracks oil supply, said it was also seeing an upward trend in Iranian crude exports which, in its view, in December reached their highest level since March 2019.Kpler, a data intelligence firm, put Iranian crude exports at 1.23 million bpd in November, the highest since August 2022 and almost on a par with April 2019's rate of 1.27 million bpd, although they slipped to just below 1 million bpd in December.The Iranian oil ministry did not respond to a request for comment on exports. Iran's draft state budget is based on even higher shipments of 1.4 million bpd, the semi-official Fars news agency reported this week.China is Iran's biggest customer. To evade sanctions, most of Iran's crude exports to China are rebranded as crude from other countries, according to analysts including FGE. Iran in the past has said documents were forged to hide the origin of Iranian cargoes.Also, Iran last year expanded its role in Venezuela, also under U.S. sanctions, sending supplies of light oil for refining and diluents to produce exportable crude grades.MORE TO CHINAThere is no definitive figure for Iranian oil exports and estimates often fall into a wide range. Tanker-tracking companies use various methods to track the flows, including satellite data, port loading data and human intelligence. Iran generally does not release figures.According to another analyst, Vortexa, China's December imports of Iranian oil hit a new record of 1.2 million bpd, up 130% from a year earlier.""Most of these shipments found home in Shandong, where independent refiners have turned to discounted grades since the second half of 2022 amid sluggish domestic demand and depressed refining margins,"" the company said.The press department of China's Foreign Ministry, in response to a request for comment, said: ""The legitimate and reasonable cooperation between China and Iran under the international legal framework deserves respect and protection,"" without directly addressing Reuters query on China's record Iranian oil purchases.Vortexa said supply of Russian Urals, the main competing grade to Iranian oil, fell in December - when a price cap on Russian crude exports and European Union ban created uncertainty for buyers.A revived nuclear deal would allow Iran to boost sales to former buyers like South Korea and Europe.Still, talks have been at a stalemate since September, and Washington's special envoy for Iran said in November Tehran's crackdown on anti-government protesters and the sale of drones to Russia have turned Washington's focus away from the deal.Following Trump's removal of the United States from the nuclear deal and reimposition of sanctions, Iran's crude exports fell back to as little as 100,000 bpd at times in 2020 from over 2.5 million bpd in 2018, according to tanker trackers.(Reporting by Alex Lawler; Additional reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin, Chen Aizhu and Timothy Gardner; Editing by David Evans)]"

Finally, in late September, SSR was given the green light to restart operations.While this was certainly an unwelcome event, the operating team was proactive and used the downtime to conduct site maintenance that would have resulted in idle time later in the year. Moreover, the projection for next year looks promising, and gold — which has been flat this year — is returning to form as the US dollar gives back some previous gains.Supporting SSRM’s thesis is a solid balance sheet, a history of strong revenue growth, and even a modest dividend. It has one of the longest mine life cycles in the industry, and a handful of low-cost assets scattered across Türkiye, Canada, the US, and Argentina.These operating mines have upside development opportunities and exploration potential too. SSR’s executive team is attempting to make the most of these development and exploration sites by consolidating its land base with the acquisitions of Taiga Gold in Canada and Lidya Mining’s stake in Çöpler.In 2017, I was fortunate enough to be invited to Çöpler and to see the development firsthand; the scale of what they achieved is truly impressive. Though staff certainly erred with the cyanide spill in June, this is the first significant operational misstep I can recall since we became interested in the name nearly a decade ago.Story continuesThe company also has a strong operating team, having completed the Çöpler development project on time and under budget years ago. These underlying strengths, plus restarting operations at Çöpler and gold’s potential to rally, should bode well for SSRM owners in 2023.See also: Top Picks 2023: Intel Corp. (INTC)This outlook has risks along with it too, however, which is why SSRM is my speculative pick for 2023. Gold, for example, may not pan out as I am projecting. Türkiye, where the Çöpler mine is based, faces many economic and socio-political challenges, and insiders (the people most in the know) have been net sellers of stock over the past year.

16,ce1058b0-c1c3-3c5c-8137-c57c62d40a54,FE,2023-01-15,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-043911345.html,1673757551,STORY,"['GC=F', 'NG=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com - Even John Arnold, the first trader to make billions off the volatility in natural gas, might be stunned with what’s happened with the heating fuel’s prices in just over a month.From a December 1 peak above $7 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units, the front-month gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub hit a 19-month low of $3.417 on Friday, settling down 52% from that peak six weeks ago. Prior to that, gas hit a 14-year high of $10 in August.Arnold, who started at Enron and exited that energy trading firm just before it blew up in a gigantic accounting fraud, formed Centaurus in 2002, a hedge fund that ran as much as $5 billion at one point in natural gas.Over the next decade, he made so much money trading natural gas - reports say about $3 billion - as the market plunged from a record high above $15 per mmBtu in December 2005 to around $6 by September 2006, that he was grilled at a congressional hearing, in the aftermath of the 2008/9 financial crisis.Since retiring in 2012 at the age of 38, Arnold has barely commented on the gas market, staying true to his cause as a philanthropist and as his Twitter account says “eternally fighting status quo bias”.While Arnold had seen the greatest peaks in gas prices in his time, the market’s volatility then seemed a little more measured than now.Point in case: It took nine months for that December 2005 record high of above $15 to achieve a 60% swing-down to around $6 by September 2006. Compared to that, the Henry Hub lost 65% from mid-August 2022 to below $3.50 by mid-January this year: a plunge that only took five months. In fact, from above $7 in December, the market dove 52% in just six weeks.After explosive upward price action for most of 2022 from weather extremities and a supply squeeze caused by political and other disruptions to Russian gas output in the aftermath of the Ukraine invasion, natural gas futures suddenly collapsed last month. The change has been attributed primarily to unseasonably warm winter temperatures that have left both the U.S. and European heating markets sufficiently supplied.Story continuesFriday’s leg lower on the Henry Hub came after the Energy Information Administration reported an 11-bcf (billion cubic feet) build in gas storage for the week ended Jan. 6. It was the first ever gas storage build during a January month.The increase in gas inventories, which came during what is being described as the warmest start to a winter in 20 years, was at the higher end of forecasts by some industry analysts, who expected a build of under 10 bcf last week. Some 14 analysts polled by Reuters had, meanwhile, predicted a draw of 15 bcf on the average from storage last week.Exports of LNG, or liquefied natural gas, have also been tamped down since June with the shutdown of the Freeport liquefaction facility in Texas. The Freeport outage has idled about 2 bcf of gas per day, or a cumulative 60 bcf a month. That is independent of what’s happening on the weather front.“Until there are better agreements among all the significant weather forecast models on the February outlook, the gas market will likely view any winter outbreaks with skepticism,” Houston-based energy trading consultancy Gelber&amp;Associates said in a note on Friday to its clients in natural gas.Some readers might actually wonder if the pivot toward greater cold is already happening. Today’s temperatures, for instance, are among the coldest for this year, dropping to 29 degrees Fahrenheit (-1.7 Celsius) in New York. Gelber said “early-bird market estimates” for next week’s gas storage data is a build between 69 and 75 bcf for the week ended Jan. 13.Some contend that the plunge in gas prices has nothing to do with fundamentals but more of a “collusion or price fixing” by big hedge fund managers.Among the reader feedback I got this week was that the weather was colder in Canada, and the Northern and Eastern United States versus the moderate temperatures experienced elsewhere on the continent. I was told the current pricing was not sustainable as it was pretty much at break-even point with production costs. Any lower the market goes, supply will cease, was the warning I was given. Also, short sellers need higher prices to initiate their shorts and prices will soon be pushed upwards again, was what I heard.My response was that gas was already overpriced for months, with inventories trending flat year-on-year even as the Henry Hub traded twice higher. As December dawned, it became obvious that the so-called storage squeeze was not going to materialize and Europe wasn't so much at Vladimir Putin's mercy (it was the other way round, actually; the Russian president was at the mercy of the weather gods). Thus, the market collapse of the past six weeks.If indeed, “collusion or price fixing” had brought the market down, then the higher-and-higher prices leading to the $10 peak of August had little in the way of fundamentals too — except perhaps Putin’s ominous voice.Natural Gas: Market Settlements and Activity Henry Hub’s front-month February gas contract did a final trade at $3.481 per mmBtu, after officially settling Friday’s session at $3.419 - down 27.60 cents, or 7.5%, on the day. February gas earlier hit a session bottom at $3.417 - its lowest since June 25, 2021.February gas rose a combined 1.5% on Wednesday and Thursday before ending the week down 8%. Cumulatively, warm winter weather has erased 52% of the market’s value over just six weeks.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity The softening inflation game in the United States is helping oil bulls out, though rising crude prices on their own might ultimately lead to higher inflation.New York-traded WTI, or West Texas Intermediate, crude for February delivery did a final trade of $80.07 on Friday, after settling the official session up $1.47, or 1.9%, at $79.86 per barrel, following a session high at $79.85. The U.S. crude benchmark rose 8.4% gain on the week, completely erasing losses from a week ago.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $85.49 on Friday, after settling the session at $85.28, up $1.25, or 1.5%, on the day. The intraday peak for Brent was $85.34. For the week, the global crude benchmark gained 8.5%, making up for all of the previous week's drop, like WTI.Inflation, as indicated by the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, rose by 6.5% in the 12 months to December, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the slowest annual advance for the CPI since October 2021 and indicated smaller rate hikes ahead by the Federal Reserve, which raised rates aggressively last year to curb price pressures.Adding to the Labor Department data, the University of Michigan's closely-watched survey of consumers said on Friday that year-ahead inflation expectations among Americans has fallen for a fourth straight month in January, dipping to 4.0% from 4.4% in December. It was the lowest reading for price pressures since April 2021, the survey said.The lower inflation readings are bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep to smaller rate hikes this year which would greatly assist businesses in the country, after the aggressive increases last year that sent tremors across markets. Those expectations have bolstered risk appetite in most forms this week, including in oil.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold neared a nine-month high on Friday, approaching the key $1,950-an-ounce resistance, as softening U.S. inflation and rate hike expectations boosted contrarian safe-haven trades.Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade at $1,923.35 an ounce, after officially settling the session at $1,921.70 - up $22.90, or 1.2%, on the day. Its session high of $1,925.25 was the loftiest for a front-month contract in Comex gold since the April 25 peak of $1,935.50.U.S. gold futures contracts have risen 5% since 2023 began, extending its near 4% gain from December and 7% from November.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,920.13 - up $23.22, or 1.2%, on the day. Spot gold’s intraday peak was $1,921.97- also the highest since April 25.Gold has rallied over the past three months as receding inflation drove bond yields and the dollar lower on expectations that the Federal Reserve will be a lot less aggressive with rate hikes this year versus 2022, and might even wrap its monetary tightening well before the end of 2023.“Gold prices are rising as Wall Street grows confident that the Fed is almost done with raising rates,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Non-interest bearing gold is loving the slide in bond yields and that could continue as earnings come in softer-than-expected.”The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note was at 3.49% on Friday, versus the October peak of 4.34%. The Dollar Index, which pits the greenback against six competing major currencies that include the euro and yen, steadied at just above 102, after tumbling from September’s highs of above 107.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesU.S. climate envoy Kerry outlines carbon offset initiative for developing nationsThunberg joins march on German village in protest against coal mine expansion]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.33bUS$1.59bUS$1.84bUS$2.02bUS$2.16bUS$2.28bUS$2.38bUS$2.46bUS$2.54bUS$2.61bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Est @ 6.84%Est @ 5.38%Est @ 4.36%Est @ 3.65%Est @ 3.15%Est @ 2.80% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$1.2kUS$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.0%) = US$44bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$44b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$20bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$34b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$684, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TransDigm Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.013. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TransDigm GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

To be sure, plenty of headwinds exist, including historically high inflation and concerns about monetary policy. That said, it’s doubtful that every single enterprise will fail. Therefore, amid last year’s fallout, contrarians should consider certain compelling discounts.Primarily, the best bargain stocks to buy center on the necessities. As well, they target social trends that investors can reliably bank on. However, other market ideas simply offer a great deal based on their underlying fundamentals. And because 2022 was so awful, plenty of bargains exist, as you can see below.UMCUnited Microelectronics$7.44INTCIntel$29.85KRKroger$45.61PSXPhillips 66$101.42BHPBHP Group$67.30TSNTyson Foods$65.81LPXLouisiana-Pacific$64.57InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUnited Microelectronics (UMC)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockFounded as Taiwan’s first semiconductor firm, United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) enjoys a rich history. Unfortunately, this geographic angle makes it a bit of a tricky narrative among the best bargain stocks to buy. With tensions rising between Taiwan and China – and because of U.S. support of the small breakaway island – drama is the last thing UMC needs.Therefore, it’s not a shocker that UMC dropped 37% of equity value in the trailing year. However, the near-term momentum for shares has been impressive. In the trailing five days, UMC gained 11% of market value. In the trailing six months, the stock boomed by nearly 14%. Yet despite this dynamic, UMC trades hands at 6.9 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 16.6 times.Also, UMC is priced at 8.35 times forward earnings. Here, this metric ranks lower than 90% of the industry. In addition, the company features solid revenue growth and excellent profitability margins. Once the global economy normalizes, UMC could move significantly higher, making it one of the best bargain stocks to buy.Story continuesIntel (INTC)blue graphic of person's face made of binary code and microchip lines PGY stock.Source: shutterstock.com/PeshkovaOnce one of the standard bearers of the technology ecosystem, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) lost some of its shine in recent years. From competitive pressures to some unforced errors, Intel admittedly looked sloppy. At the same time, many hope that the innovative spirit that guided INTC all these years still remains. For speculators, INTC could be one of the best bargain stocks to buy.Indeed, the tech giant made some big news last week, announcing the launch of the world’s fastest mobile processor. The disclosure occurred during the CES tech industry tradeshow. While the flagship Intel Core i9 may be overkill for most users, the processor targets two viable segments: hardcore gamers and professional users. With video games representing a burgeoning market, INTC appears worthy as one of the best bargain stocks to buy.Also, Intel’s objectively cheap. Currently, the market prices INTC at just over 9 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median is 16.6 times.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the case for Kroger (NYSE:KR) as one of the best bargain stocks to buy really sells itself. Let’s look at it this way. No matter what happens in the economy, people must eat. Therefore, Kroger largely benefits from the trade-down effect, whereby consumers seek out cheaper alternatives until reaching a quality/price equilibrium.In Kroger’s case, people will give up eating out at fancy restaurants. Moreover, they’ll quit food-delivery services as well if finances force the trade down. Eventually, though, you’d figure that most people will trade down to Kroger for their culinary needs. Therefore, even with KR down about 4% in the trailing year, it’s worth picking up. Predictably, people will go through those doors.Financially as well, Kroger is one of the best bargain stocks to buy. At the moment, the market prices KR at 10.8 times forward earnings. For comparison, the industry’s forward price-earnings ratio stands at 16.7 times.Phillips 66 (PSX)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comWhen you think about Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) as one of the best bargain stocks to buy, investors shouldn’t just focus on the company, which specializes in downstream (refining and marketing) energy services. Rather, they should look to Disney (NYSE:DIS) and specifically its reappointed CEO Bob Iger. Trust me, this will make sense.According to an email obtained by CNBC, Iger wants Disney’s hybrid employees to return to the office for four days a week. The change will officially take place on March 1. Fundamentally, this announcement and probably similar ones to come should bode well for the gig economy. After all, people like working from home. But more than likely, most will toe the line, especially under present economic conditions.You know what that means, don’t you? You got it, an increase in the vehicle miles traveled. I’d say that the spike will be significant. Of course, such a framework translates to more fuel consumption, bolstering PSX as one of the best bargain stocks to buy.BHP Group (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockFor forward-looking investors, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) makes for an enticing case for the best bargain stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the mining specialist focuses on the commodities of tomorrow. For instance, its copper projects should increase in demand for many years to come. As you probably know, copper is a crucial component of electric vehicles.Not surprisingly, BHP did very well in 2022, a sharp contrast to other public entities. In the trailing year, BHP gained over 16%. Better yet, shares have maintained their positive momentum in the near term. For instance, during the past five sessions, BHP returned over 7% of the value. And in the trailing month, it’s up nearly 6%.Per data from Gurufocus.com, the market prices BHP at 5.5 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the underlying industry median stands at 12 times. As well, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet and high business quality as reflected by its return on equity of 65%. This latter stat beats out 98% of the competition.Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comOne of the largest food processors, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) fundamentally offers an indispensable service. Nevertheless, it’s fair to point out that TSN did not enjoy a strong showing last year. For instance, shares slipped 28% in the trailing 365 days. A tough environment due to food supply chains along with some unnecessary drama negatively affected sentiment.Still, people must eat. And when you have a critical service like Tyson Foods, much will be forgiven. There’s no other choice, really. On a lighter note, Tyson’s one of the best bargain stocks to buy based on traditional valuation metrics. According to Gurufocus.com, TSN trades at 7.35 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 17.5 times.If that wasn’t convincing enough, the market prices TSN at 9.8 times forward earnings. For the industry, the median forward PE ratio stands at 16.1 times. Also, the company benefits from a stable balance sheet and a high ROE of 17.2%, reflecting a superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits.Louisiana-Pacific (LPX)A photo of a person in a neon green vest holding blueprints and standing behind a white table covered with supplies like pencils, a computer, a ruler and two wooden house shapes.Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.comAn American building materials manufacturer, Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX) may be somewhat of a mixed bag. With global recession fears rising, the narrative for Louisiana-Pacific may encounter significant challenges. However, some room for optimism exists. Mainly, initiatives under the Biden administration to rebuild infrastructure may boost the company’s profile.Of course, it might take some convincing from the broader market. In the trailing year, LPX stock dropped over 17% in equity value. Still, the bulls may counter that near-term momentum favors LPX. For instance, during the past half-year period, shares gained 8%. This might reflect the early stages of a recovery effort.Even though LPX enjoys its core group of supporters, it remains one of the best bargain stocks to buy. Currently, shares trade at under 4-times trailing earnings. This compares favorably to the industry’s PE ratio of 13 times. Also, the company features a stable balance sheet (particularly a high cash-to-debt ratio) and outstanding profitability margins.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This was when the federal reserve was pursuing aggressive contractionary monetary policies. During this time, gold had also trended lower with high interest rates aimed at curbing inflation.However, the dollar index currently trades at around 103 and has been trending lower. In general, a weak dollar is positive for precious metals. I believe that the dollar will continue to weaken in 2023. The reason is that the world is staring at a potential recession. In such a scenario, aggressive contractionary monetary policy seems unlikely. On the contrary, policymakers globally might shift to expansionary policies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSome of the best gold stocks have been depressed last year for reasons explained. With the potential reversal in monetary policy, it’s a good time to look at some gold stocks to buy. In addition to the potential for capital gains, these gold stocks also offer an attractive dividend yield.Let’s discuss four fundamentally strong gold stocks to buy for 2023 and beyond.NEMNewmont Corporation$52.46GOLDBarrick Gold$19.22KGCKinross Gold$4.56AUAngloGold Ashanti$22.01Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is among the top gold stocks to buy.In the last 12 months, NEM stock has declined by 15%. This is understandable as the federal reserve pursued aggressive contractionary policies in 2022. The stock looks undervalued and is poised for a reversal rally.Newmont has 96 million ounces of gold reserves. Additionally, the company has 68 million ounces of copper and silver reserves. With a robust reserve base, the company expects to sustain steady production in the coming years.Newmont is also attractive considering the cash flow potential. Even with the depressed gold price, the company reported operating cash flow of $466 million for Q3 2022. If gold trades above $1,800 an ounce, the company is well-positioned to deliver annual operating cash flows in excess of $2 billion.Story continuesWith an investment-grade balance sheet, Newmont is also positioned to make sustained investments and pursue potential acquisitions. A dividend yield of 4.2% also makes NEM stock attractive.Barrick Gold (GOLD)How to Play Barrick Gold Stock Ahead of Today's EarningsSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comWith the recovery in the gold price, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) stock has trended higher by 17% in the last six months. However, the 2.1% dividend yield stock remains attractive at current levels for long-term exposure.Barrick Gold also has a strong asset base with 69 million ounces in proven and probable reserves. Last year, the company replaced its depletion of gold mineral reserves by 150%. Robust replacement on a sustained basis positions Barrick for steady cash flows in the coming decade.For the first nine months of 2022, Barrick Gold reported a healthy operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. Assuming a scenario where gold trades around $2,000 an ounce, Barrick is likely to deliver OCF in excess of $4 billion.Considering the cash flow potential, GOLD stock is an attractive dividend growth stock to consider. Barrick has an investment-grade balance sheet and ended Q3 2022 with cash and equivalents of $5.2 billion. This positions Barrick for aggressive exploration activity to further boost its proven reserves.Kinross Gold (KGC)Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAmong the relatively smaller names, Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) stock looks attractive. Kinross had a difficult last year with the company selling Russian assets at a steep discount. This translated into a revision of production guidance for 2023 and beyond.However, the worst seems to be over and KGC stock has already moved higher by 8% in the last month. I expect this uptrend to sustain with Kinross having guided for steady production for the next few years. The company has also guided for sustained free cash flows.It’s also worth noting that Kinross reported a liquidity buffer of $2 billion as of Q3 2022. Strong financial flexibility implies that dividends are safe. Kinross is already pursuing a $450 million share buyback program.I also believe that asset acquisition is likely considering a strong liquidity buffer and positive free cash flows. Any upward revision in the company’s production guidance can translate into a meaningful rally.AngloGold Ashanti (AU)Person holding cellphone with logo of South African mining company AngloGold Ashanti Limited on screen in front of website. AU stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockAngloGold Ashanti (NYSE:AU) stock has been the best-performing gold stock in the last six months. During this period, the stock has surged by almost 52%. Even after the big rally, AU stock looks undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.6. As gold trends higher, I expect the positive momentum to sustain.One reason for the stock moving higher is the company’s focus on cost control. As an example, AngloGold reported an all-in-sustaining cost of $1,284 an ounce for Q3 2022 as compared to $1,362 an ounce in Q3 2021.With gold trading at $1,840 an ounce, AngloGold is positioned for healthy cash flows. For the last quarter, the company reported free cash flow of $169 million. With a higher realized price, it’s likely that the annualized FCF will be around $1 billion.AngloGold also has a quality balance sheet. As of Q3 2022, the company reported a gearing ratio of 0.41. With $2.5 billion in liquidity buffer, the company is well positioned to invest in exploration projects.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Indeed, it was the only segment in the S&amp;P 500 that rose in 2022. While the S&amp;P 500 lost 19.44% of its value in 2022, energy stocks shot up a massive 59%. As a result, I think that these dividend-paying energy stocks to buy will be popular with investors again this year, which could be another difficult period Given the uncertain outlook in 2023, investors should look to buy defensive stocks, lesser-known names, and blue-chip stalwarts in the energy sector this year. These three stocks pay dividends, making them particularly attractive to investors looking for income. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNEENextEra$85FANGDiamondback Energy$142.60CVXChevron$175NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) has a lot going for it that makes it a strong pick going into 2023. The company has two main businesses, both of which can grow significantly moving forward. NextEra Energy owns Florida Power &amp; Light which is the largest electric utility in the U.S., providing electricity to 5.8 million people in Florida. FP&amp;L is also the world’s largest generator of renewable energy and owns nuclear power plants in three states. Three quarters of NextEra Energy’s $6.719 billion of revenues in Q3 were generated by its utility business. And that means NEE stock has some defensive characteristics which will make it attractive in 2023. However, it should be noted that NE’s renewable energy segment has much higher margins and provides roughly 60% more profit than the utility unit despite generating only one-third as much revenue. The growth of renewable energy in the U.S. bodes well for the firm both in terms of top-line growth and bottom-line profitability. Finally, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.1%. Diamondback Energy (FANG)diamondback energy logo on its website to represent oil stocksSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comStory continuesDiamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) is an oil company that had a solid but not exceptional 2022 as its share price increased from $123 to $136. Although FANG stock didn’t perform as strongly as a number of other names in the sector, there’s reason to believe that it’ll be a solid choice in 2023.Worth noting is that the majority of analysts give FANG stock a “buy” rating and that the average rating on it is “overweight.” And analysts’ average price target on the name is  $181. That’s encouraging since its shares currently trade for $142.60. Aside from that, Diamondback Energy is a particularly attractive investment because its expenses are lower than those of its competitors. Its low-cost operations will continue to attract investors to its shares in 2023 amid continued high inflation. The company generated $1.2 billion of cash flow in Q3, 75% of which was returned to investors in the form of stock repurchases. FANG also paid out $402 million of dividends. Those factors should make Diamondback Energy a clear winner in the energy sector this year. Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) had an excellent year in 2022, causing its stock to appreciate more than 43%. Chevron’s revenue jumped 65% year-over-year to $181.2 billion through the first nine months of 2022. Its net income nearly tripled last year to $29.11 billion. Chevron delivered great financial results in 2022. That might logically cause some investors to unload CVX stock in 2023. But Chevron will continue to be largely the same company in 2023 that it was in 2022. Analysts, on average,  expect CVX to appreciate in price modestly this year. And the company, which hasn’t cut its dividend since 1988, has a dividend yield of 3.25%. Chevron recently released its capital expenditure budget for 2023. That budget is 25% bigger than its 2022 capex. At the same time, the company intends to more than double its lower-carbon capital expenditures this year to $2 billion. It is embracing a lower-carbon future while continuing to expand its main business that produced a banner year in 2022. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To be sure, plenty of headwinds exist, including historically high inflation and concerns about monetary policy. That said, it’s doubtful that every single enterprise will fail. Therefore, amid last year’s fallout, contrarians should consider certain compelling discounts.Primarily, the best bargain stocks to buy center on the necessities. As well, they target social trends that investors can reliably bank on. However, other market ideas simply offer a great deal based on their underlying fundamentals. And because 2022 was so awful, plenty of bargains exist, as you can see below.UMCUnited Microelectronics$7.44INTCIntel$29.85KRKroger$45.61PSXPhillips 66$101.42BHPBHP Group$67.30TSNTyson Foods$65.81LPXLouisiana-Pacific$64.57InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUnited Microelectronics (UMC)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockFounded as Taiwan’s first semiconductor firm, United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) enjoys a rich history. Unfortunately, this geographic angle makes it a bit of a tricky narrative among the best bargain stocks to buy. With tensions rising between Taiwan and China – and because of U.S. support of the small breakaway island – drama is the last thing UMC needs.Therefore, it’s not a shocker that UMC dropped 37% of equity value in the trailing year. However, the near-term momentum for shares has been impressive. In the trailing five days, UMC gained 11% of market value. In the trailing six months, the stock boomed by nearly 14%. Yet despite this dynamic, UMC trades hands at 6.9 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 16.6 times.Also, UMC is priced at 8.35 times forward earnings. Here, this metric ranks lower than 90% of the industry. In addition, the company features solid revenue growth and excellent profitability margins. Once the global economy normalizes, UMC could move significantly higher, making it one of the best bargain stocks to buy.Story continuesIntel (INTC)blue graphic of person's face made of binary code and microchip lines PGY stock.Source: shutterstock.com/PeshkovaOnce one of the standard bearers of the technology ecosystem, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) lost some of its shine in recent years. From competitive pressures to some unforced errors, Intel admittedly looked sloppy. At the same time, many hope that the innovative spirit that guided INTC all these years still remains. For speculators, INTC could be one of the best bargain stocks to buy.Indeed, the tech giant made some big news last week, announcing the launch of the world’s fastest mobile processor. The disclosure occurred during the CES tech industry tradeshow. While the flagship Intel Core i9 may be overkill for most users, the processor targets two viable segments: hardcore gamers and professional users. With video games representing a burgeoning market, INTC appears worthy as one of the best bargain stocks to buy.Also, Intel’s objectively cheap. Currently, the market prices INTC at just over 9 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median is 16.6 times.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the case for Kroger (NYSE:KR) as one of the best bargain stocks to buy really sells itself. Let’s look at it this way. No matter what happens in the economy, people must eat. Therefore, Kroger largely benefits from the trade-down effect, whereby consumers seek out cheaper alternatives until reaching a quality/price equilibrium.In Kroger’s case, people will give up eating out at fancy restaurants. Moreover, they’ll quit food-delivery services as well if finances force the trade down. Eventually, though, you’d figure that most people will trade down to Kroger for their culinary needs. Therefore, even with KR down about 4% in the trailing year, it’s worth picking up. Predictably, people will go through those doors.Financially as well, Kroger is one of the best bargain stocks to buy. At the moment, the market prices KR at 10.8 times forward earnings. For comparison, the industry’s forward price-earnings ratio stands at 16.7 times.Phillips 66 (PSX)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comWhen you think about Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) as one of the best bargain stocks to buy, investors shouldn’t just focus on the company, which specializes in downstream (refining and marketing) energy services. Rather, they should look to Disney (NYSE:DIS) and specifically its reappointed CEO Bob Iger. Trust me, this will make sense.According to an email obtained by CNBC, Iger wants Disney’s hybrid employees to return to the office for four days a week. The change will officially take place on March 1. Fundamentally, this announcement and probably similar ones to come should bode well for the gig economy. After all, people like working from home. But more than likely, most will toe the line, especially under present economic conditions.You know what that means, don’t you? You got it, an increase in the vehicle miles traveled. I’d say that the spike will be significant. Of course, such a framework translates to more fuel consumption, bolstering PSX as one of the best bargain stocks to buy.BHP Group (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockFor forward-looking investors, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) makes for an enticing case for the best bargain stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the mining specialist focuses on the commodities of tomorrow. For instance, its copper projects should increase in demand for many years to come. As you probably know, copper is a crucial component of electric vehicles.Not surprisingly, BHP did very well in 2022, a sharp contrast to other public entities. In the trailing year, BHP gained over 16%. Better yet, shares have maintained their positive momentum in the near term. For instance, during the past five sessions, BHP returned over 7% of the value. And in the trailing month, it’s up nearly 6%.Per data from Gurufocus.com, the market prices BHP at 5.5 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the underlying industry median stands at 12 times. As well, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet and high business quality as reflected by its return on equity of 65%. This latter stat beats out 98% of the competition.Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comOne of the largest food processors, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) fundamentally offers an indispensable service. Nevertheless, it’s fair to point out that TSN did not enjoy a strong showing last year. For instance, shares slipped 28% in the trailing 365 days. A tough environment due to food supply chains along with some unnecessary drama negatively affected sentiment.Still, people must eat. And when you have a critical service like Tyson Foods, much will be forgiven. There’s no other choice, really. On a lighter note, Tyson’s one of the best bargain stocks to buy based on traditional valuation metrics. According to Gurufocus.com, TSN trades at 7.35 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 17.5 times.If that wasn’t convincing enough, the market prices TSN at 9.8 times forward earnings. For the industry, the median forward PE ratio stands at 16.1 times. Also, the company benefits from a stable balance sheet and a high ROE of 17.2%, reflecting a superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits.Louisiana-Pacific (LPX)A photo of a person in a neon green vest holding blueprints and standing behind a white table covered with supplies like pencils, a computer, a ruler and two wooden house shapes.Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.comAn American building materials manufacturer, Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX) may be somewhat of a mixed bag.

In the trailing year, LPX stock dropped over 17% in equity value. Still, the bulls may counter that near-term momentum favors LPX. For instance, during the past half-year period, shares gained 8%. This might reflect the early stages of a recovery effort.Even though LPX enjoys its core group of supporters, it remains one of the best bargain stocks to buy. Currently, shares trade at under 4-times trailing earnings. This compares favorably to the industry’s PE ratio of 13 times. Also, the company features a stable balance sheet (particularly a high cash-to-debt ratio) and outstanding profitability margins.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

36,608b8406-4609-3181-9ae9-7c2760a1c5cd,MA,2023-01-15,Is Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) Potentially Undervalued?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-incorporated-nyse-ma-potentially-120039367.html,1673784039,STORY,['MA'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Mastercard’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Mastercard Is Mastercard Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Mastercard seems to be fairly priced at around 14.43% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Mastercard today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $328.18, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Mastercard’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Mastercard?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 51% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Mastercard. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MA’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MA, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

However, the report presented a skeptical view on global growth due to the re-emergence of Covid in China and the ongoing natural gas crisis in Europe. In the current market situation, investors expect defensive value stocks to hold the reins this year as recession fears will continue to haunt the stock market.Over the years, high-quality growth stocks outperformed value equities. However, with the tech sell-off last year, value investing gained traction among investors. In Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in the first week of January 2023, 54% of respondents mentioned that they are inclined to invest more in value stocks this year, up from 39% three months ago. Another survey by CNBC revealed that 72% of the participants will prefer value over growth this year. Last year’s returns also showed the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In 2022, the Russell 1000 Value Index fell by 7.5%, compared with a much harsh decline of 29.1% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Analysts expect the value investing trend to continue this year as well. Sarah Ketterer, a chief executive of Causeway Capital Management, spoke to The Street about the investment outlook in 2023. She asserted that stable interest rates would bode well for value stocks. She also mentioned that while investing in value stocks, investors should also consider the return on capital like dividends and buybacks.Dividend stocks also reported strong performance in 2022 as investors preferred income-generating stocks. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed over $561 billion in dividends last year, up from $511.2 billion in 2021, as reported by Wall Street Journal. Among these companies, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) remained popular among investors as these companies have shown solid dividend growth over the years.Story continues11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy NowPhoto by buian_photos on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below have raised their dividends for 25 years or more.

41,ebe951a7-53c9-3fca-b0a0-5681dc5a8ecd,JNJ,2023-01-15,7 Hot Healthcare Stocks to Watch in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-hot-healthcare-stocks-watch-180637851.html,1673460397,STORY,"['LLY', '^GSPC', 'UNH', 'JNJ', 'PFE', 'MRNA', 'MRK', 'HUM']","[While it has not produced the big gains seen among other sectors such as energy, healthcare has been a quiet outperformer over the past year. The S&amp;P 500 Healthcare Index is essentially flat over the past 12 months. While that might not sound great, it is a lot better than the 16% decline of the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index during the same period. The stocks of several pharmaceutical companies have increased more than 30% in the last year, driven higher by a combination of strong sales and a pipeline of promising, new medications. Healthcare stocks have also proven to be resilient in the wake of inflation, rising interest rates, and a volatile economy. That is because medications and health insurance are viewed as necessary staples rather than discretionary items. As we embark on a New Year, we offer the following list of seven promising healthcare stocks for 2023.UNHUnited Health$490.50MRNAModerna$185LLYEli Lilly$356.20HUMHumana$488PFEPfizer$47.30MRKMerck$110JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$173.30UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comFor a solid, long-term investment, look to UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). The Minnesota-based company specializes in both individual and group health insurance, and it is the largest healthcare company by revenue and the largest insurance company by net premiums in the world. UnitedHealth Group is also the world’s seventh biggest company with annual revenues approaching $300 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGiven the nature of its business, UnitedHealth Group is a great stock to own during a recession. Businesses and, to a lesser extent, consumers,  are likely to prioritize paying their health insurance premiums even during an economic downturn. That helps to explain why UNH stock has risen 4.5% over the past 12 months, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index that has fallen 16% in the same time period.Over the last five years, UNH stock has gained 115%, making it a great investment to hold over the long term. And despite its recent outperformance, 23 analysts who cover the company have a median price target on the stock of $600,  23% above its current levels.Story continuesModerna (MRNA)The Moderna (MRNA) logo surrounded by syringes, pills and disposable face masks.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comBoston-based biopharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is winning back investors with its robust pipeline of new medications, including a promising vaccine that would simultaneously protect people against both Covid-19 and influenza, as well as several cancer treatments.While still below the highs reached during the pandemic when its vaccine against Covid-19 was one of the first to be approved by the FDA, MRNA stock has risen 40% in the past three months, and is now up nearly 4% over the last five trading days.At around $185 a share and with a price-earnings ratio of only 6.7, MRNA stock looks cheap when compared to many other pharmaceutical stocks. The company has also continued to report strong earnings due to the global sales of its Covid-19 vaccine, which generated $18.4 billion of revenue for it in 2022.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) might have the blockbuster medication of the next decade on its hands with its obesity drug, Tirzepatide. While not yet commercially available, Tirzepatide has been granted “fast track” designation by the FDA.If approved, Tirzepatide could help more than 2 billion adults worldwide who struggle with their weight. Some analysts are forecasting that Tirzepatide could be the best-selling drug ever produced. The hype surrounding the weight-loss medication has propelled LLY stock 38% higher over the past year, making it a top performer in the S&amp;P 500 index.Of course, Tirzepatide would not be the first blockbuster medication from Indiana-based Eli Lilly. The company also produces Prozac that’s used to treat depression and Cialis for erectile dysfunction. Those medications, and others, have powered Eli Lilly to annual sales of more than $30 billion.Humana (HUM)A Humana (HUM) office buildingSource: Shutterstock.comAnother promising healthcare stock for 2023 is insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM). The Kentucky-based company, which is the third-largest health insurance provider in America, had a very good 2022. In the last 12 months, HUM stock has risen 23% to $488 a share.Most analysts expect the stock to climb further going forward. The 23 analysts who cover the company have a median price target on the name of $625, which is nearly 30% higher than where it currently trades.The reason everyone seems bullish on HUM stock is the company’s growth potential. Humana currently insures more than 22 million people. And its Medicare Advantage customer base is forecast to grow an average of 14.7% annually through the next five years.While the company’s dividend looks skimpy with a yield of only 0.65%, its dividend payout ratio is currently 12%, enabling the company to deliver strong annual dividend increases of 15% or more over the next five to ten years.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) remains a solid, blue-chip pharmaceutical stock. The company has produced many blockbuster drugs over the years, with its Covid-19 vaccine being the latest global bestseller. The New York City-based company sold $36.7 billion worth of Covid-19 vaccines in 2021.The company has predicted that it sold $54.5 billion of Covid-19 vaccines last year, including booster shots, in 2022. Yet for all its success, PFE stock has fallen 17% in the last 12 months, matching the decline of the S&amp;P 500 index. The company’s P/E ratio is a modest 9.17, suggesting the stock is cheap at its current levels.Additionally, investors who buy PFE stock get a quarterly dividend that yields 3.4%. Pfizer also has in its pipeline a Covid-19 treatment called Paxlovid that some analysts say could be the company’s newest blockbuster medication. Investors should buy the dip of this stock.Merck &amp; Co. (MRK)Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comAnother healthcare stock that has been a winner over the last year and looks promising in 2023 is Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK). The firm’s rapid earnings growth and its strong pipeline of products helped push MRK stock up 36% in the last year. The stock now trades at $110 and could gain even more in  the coming months.MRK stock really took off last autumn after its medication, Keytruda, was approved for the treatment of certain cancers. The company is also working with Moderna on a medication to treat skin cancer that has shown promising results. Finally, Merck has a robust Animal Health unit that makes leading veterinary pharmaceuticals.The company’s P/E ratio of 18 is about average among the stocks of pharma companies, and its dividend yield of 2.64% is significant, making MRK stock more attractive.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a steady stock. It doesn’t post spectacular gains, but it motors along at a decent clip. And investors who are worried about inflation and a possible recession should be attracted to its diverse line of consumer health products that include everything from Tylenol and Sudafed to Band-Aids and Polysporin.Of course, Johnson &amp; Johnson also produces vaccines and medications used to treat illnesses ranging from cancer to cardiovascular disease and hypertension. The company is preparing to spin off its consumer health segment into a separate company that will be called “Kenvue.” Investors may want to look into buying shares of that company once it is publicly traded.JNJ stock rose 2% over the past year. That’s not overly inspiring, but it represents a huge outperformance compared to the overall stock market. In the past five years, the stock has gained 20%. Shareholders also benefit from a decent dividend yield of 2.58%.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

It offers more sophisticated technologies. This accelerates the time to market its products. As a result, customers receive faster value sooner.Story continuesAmdocs is quick to respond to changing production environments.

Managed services grew by 12% in the fourth quarter.The company has a 12-month backlog. The solid pipeline will cushion the business from any unlikely slowdowns.

Moreover, with economists pointing toward the probability of a recession this year, investors are preferring monthly or quarterly dividend stocks to generate stable regular income.Dividend stocks tend to perform well during periods of slow economic growth. According to a recent report by Franklin Templeton, stocks with strong dividend growth track records are at their best during inflationary periods. The firm is also positive on dividend growth because many companies have the tendency to raise their payouts this year despite slow earnings growth. Another report published by BMO Capital revealed that dividend stocks delivered an annual average return of 7.8% from January 1998 to January 2013, compared to 2.4% return recorded for non-dividend companies in the same period. During this period, the S&amp;P/TSX returned 4.3%, showing the dominance of dividend stocks over other asset classes.As companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed a record amount in dividends in 2022, analysts expect the pattern to continue this year as well. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, mentioned in his recent Wall Street Journal interview that dividends are expected to notch another record this year as investors are gravitating toward dividend-paying equities. He further mentioned that corporate balance sheets are stable despite elevated interest rates and higher inflation.Quality companies like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 Healthcare Index is essentially flat over the past 12 months. While that might not sound great, it is a lot better than the 16% decline of the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index during the same period. The stocks of several pharmaceutical companies have increased more than 30% in the last year, driven higher by a combination of strong sales and a pipeline of promising, new medications. Healthcare stocks have also proven to be resilient in the wake of inflation, rising interest rates, and a volatile economy. That is because medications and health insurance are viewed as necessary staples rather than discretionary items. As we embark on a New Year, we offer the following list of seven promising healthcare stocks for 2023.UNHUnited Health$490.50MRNAModerna$185LLYEli Lilly$356.20HUMHumana$488PFEPfizer$47.30MRKMerck$110JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$173.30UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comFor a solid, long-term investment, look to UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). The Minnesota-based company specializes in both individual and group health insurance, and it is the largest healthcare company by revenue and the largest insurance company by net premiums in the world. UnitedHealth Group is also the world’s seventh biggest company with annual revenues approaching $300 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGiven the nature of its business, UnitedHealth Group is a great stock to own during a recession. Businesses and, to a lesser extent, consumers,  are likely to prioritize paying their health insurance premiums even during an economic downturn. That helps to explain why UNH stock has risen 4.5% over the past 12 months, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index that has fallen 16% in the same time period.Over the last five years, UNH stock has gained 115%, making it a great investment to hold over the long term. And despite its recent outperformance, 23 analysts who cover the company have a median price target on the stock of $600,  23% above its current levels.Story continuesModerna (MRNA)The Moderna (MRNA) logo surrounded by syringes, pills and disposable face masks.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comBoston-based biopharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is winning back investors with its robust pipeline of new medications, including a promising vaccine that would simultaneously protect people against both Covid-19 and influenza, as well as several cancer treatments.While still below the highs reached during the pandemic when its vaccine against Covid-19 was one of the first to be approved by the FDA, MRNA stock has risen 40% in the past three months, and is now up nearly 4% over the last five trading days.At around $185 a share and with a price-earnings ratio of only 6.7, MRNA stock looks cheap when compared to many other pharmaceutical stocks. The company has also continued to report strong earnings due to the global sales of its Covid-19 vaccine, which generated $18.4 billion of revenue for it in 2022.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) might have the blockbuster medication of the next decade on its hands with its obesity drug, Tirzepatide. While not yet commercially available, Tirzepatide has been granted “fast track” designation by the FDA.If approved, Tirzepatide could help more than 2 billion adults worldwide who struggle with their weight. Some analysts are forecasting that Tirzepatide could be the best-selling drug ever produced. The hype surrounding the weight-loss medication has propelled LLY stock 38% higher over the past year, making it a top performer in the S&amp;P 500 index.Of course, Tirzepatide would not be the first blockbuster medication from Indiana-based Eli Lilly. The company also produces Prozac that’s used to treat depression and Cialis for erectile dysfunction. Those medications, and others, have powered Eli Lilly to annual sales of more than $30 billion.Humana (HUM)A Humana (HUM) office buildingSource: Shutterstock.comAnother promising healthcare stock for 2023 is insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM). The Kentucky-based company, which is the third-largest health insurance provider in America, had a very good 2022. In the last 12 months, HUM stock has risen 23% to $488 a share.Most analysts expect the stock to climb further going forward. The 23 analysts who cover the company have a median price target on the name of $625, which is nearly 30% higher than where it currently trades.The reason everyone seems bullish on HUM stock is the company’s growth potential. Humana currently insures more than 22 million people. And its Medicare Advantage customer base is forecast to grow an average of 14.7% annually through the next five years.While the company’s dividend looks skimpy with a yield of only 0.65%, its dividend payout ratio is currently 12%, enabling the company to deliver strong annual dividend increases of 15% or more over the next five to ten years.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) remains a solid, blue-chip pharmaceutical stock. The company has produced many blockbuster drugs over the years, with its Covid-19 vaccine being the latest global bestseller. The New York City-based company sold $36.7 billion worth of Covid-19 vaccines in 2021.The company has predicted that it sold $54.5 billion of Covid-19 vaccines last year, including booster shots, in 2022. Yet for all its success, PFE stock has fallen 17% in the last 12 months, matching the decline of the S&amp;P 500 index. The company’s P/E ratio is a modest 9.17, suggesting the stock is cheap at its current levels.Additionally, investors who buy PFE stock get a quarterly dividend that yields 3.4%. Pfizer also has in its pipeline a Covid-19 treatment called Paxlovid that some analysts say could be the company’s newest blockbuster medication. Investors should buy the dip of this stock.Merck &amp; Co. (MRK)Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comAnother healthcare stock that has been a winner over the last year and looks promising in 2023 is Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK). The firm’s rapid earnings growth and its strong pipeline of products helped push MRK stock up 36% in the last year. The stock now trades at $110 and could gain even more in  the coming months.MRK stock really took off last autumn after its medication, Keytruda, was approved for the treatment of certain cancers. The company is also working with Moderna on a medication to treat skin cancer that has shown promising results. Finally, Merck has a robust Animal Health unit that makes leading veterinary pharmaceuticals.The company’s P/E ratio of 18 is about average among the stocks of pharma companies, and its dividend yield of 2.64% is significant, making MRK stock more attractive.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a steady stock. It doesn’t post spectacular gains, but it motors along at a decent clip. And investors who are worried about inflation and a possible recession should be attracted to its diverse line of consumer health products that include everything from Tylenol and Sudafed to Band-Aids and Polysporin.Of course, Johnson &amp; Johnson also produces vaccines and medications used to treat illnesses ranging from cancer to cardiovascular disease and hypertension. The company is preparing to spin off its consumer health segment into a separate company that will be called “Kenvue.” Investors may want to look into buying shares of that company once it is publicly traded.JNJ stock rose 2% over the past year. That’s not overly inspiring, but it represents a huge outperformance compared to the overall stock market. In the past five years, the stock has gained 20%. Shareholders also benefit from a decent dividend yield of 2.58%.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

If you want to see more stocks with the biggest buybacks, go directly to 5 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.When they generate a profit, companies can choose to keep the profits on their balance sheet, invest the profits back into the company, use the profits to buy other companies, or return the profits back to shareholders.In terms of returning profits back to shareholders, the two main ways companies return capital back to shareholders is through stock buybacks and dividends.When it comes to whether companies should return capital through buybacks or through dividends, both have their advantages and disadvantages.Whereas many shareholders would not be happy if a company were to cut its regular dividend, most investors don't expect companies to buy back their stock regularly. As a result, stock buybacks offer management more flexibility than dividends. Stock buybacks have historically also been taxed less than dividends as well although different investors have different tax rates.Stock buybacks can add value if done correctly as they can increase earnings per share if a company maintains its profits. If a company earns $1 per share, for instance, and the company buys back half of its stock and doesn't issue new shares, that company would then earn $2 per share. If that company's P/E valuation stays the same, its stock could potentially rise substantially as a result and generate a total return of potentially more than if the same company were to return the same amount of capital through a dividend.Stock buybacks can also destroy value if done incorrectly. If a company's management buys back its stock at too high of a price, shareholders would have been better off if management had paid a dividend instead.Given the advantages and disadvantages of stock buybacks and dividends, many companies have chosen to return capital through both. In terms of recent years, however, companies in the S&amp;P 500 in aggregate have returned more capital through stock buybacks than through dividends.Story continuesBuybacksIn terms of recent buybacks versus dividends, total aggregate buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 for Q3 2022 were $210.8 billion, down 10.1% from Q3 2021's $234.6 billion. By comparison total Q3 2022 dividends paid were $140.3 billion, up from $130 billion in Q3 2021.In Q3 2022, 319 companies in the S&amp;P 500 bought back stock of at least $5 million in the quarter, up from 309 in Q3 2021.In terms of taxes, 2023 is a new year with new rules when it comes to stock buybacks.As a result of the inflation reduction act of 2022, there will be a 1% excise tax on the repurchases of stocks after December 31, 2022.Many believe there could be slightly less buybacks and potentially more dividends as a result.Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMethodologyFor our list of 10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks, we used preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data for Q3 2022 from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we ranked them based on their Q3 2022 buybacks.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database of 920 funds that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks10. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,697 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Given the Russia Ukraine war, oil and gas prices have increased from 2021 levels and many big oil companies have benefited with bigger profits. In the third quarter of 2022, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) adjusted earnings surged to $10.8 billion versus adjusted earnings of $5.7 billion in Q3 2021 as a result.Given the profit increases and substantial free cash flow, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) paid dividends of $2.7 billion and also repurchased around $3.7 billion of shares in the quarter. Considering strong earnings in Q2 2022, the company in July boosted the top end of its annual share repurchase guidance range to $15 billion. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s previous annual buyback guidance was $5 billion to $10 billion.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a stock that is owned by many hedge funds in our database that repurchased a lot of shares in Q3.9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,779 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Given the company doesn't have a substantial dividend yield, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has returned most of its excess capital through buybacks in recent years. Considering its profits have increased substantially given demand growth for GPUs, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) board of directors in May of 2022 increased and extended the company's repurchase program to up to $15 billion through December 2023. With the buyback authorization, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) bought back nearly $3.8 billion worth of shares in Q3, ranking the company #9 on our list of 10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.Baron Funds commented on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in a Q3 investor letter,“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”8. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,908 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) bought back over $3.9 billion worth of its own shares in the third quarter as it completed its $15 billion return of capital commitment in October utilizing proceeds from its Speedway divestiture. In 2021, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) sold Speedway to 7-Eleven for an estimated $16.5 billion of after-tax cash proceeds. As a result of its buyback program, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) repurchased around 30% of its outstanding shares. After completing its $15 billion return of capital commitment, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) has approximately $5 billion remaining available under its current share repurchase authorizations.7. Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,999 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) has one of the biggest buyback authorizations among retailers after its board of directors announced a $15 billion buyback authorization with no expiration date. The company also still has $6.4 billion left on its previous buyback program as of December 2022. As far as buybacks go, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) bought back a lot of stock in Q3, with repurchases of nearly $4 billion. If it can increase earnings and not issue any new shares, the buybacks could help increase EPS for Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in the long term.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $4,000 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69While it is more famous for its dividend given the consumer staple's long history of increasing it every year, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has also returned a lot of capital back to shareholders through share repurchases.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Waters Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$707.4mUS$762.0mUS$852.6mUS$894.8mUS$928.0mUS$957.7mUS$984.7mUS$1.01bUS$1.03bUS$1.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 3.71%Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.83%Est @ 2.57%Est @ 2.40%Est @ 2.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$657US$657US$683US$666US$642US$615US$587US$560US$532US$506(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.1bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$19bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$19b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$9.1bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$15b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$339, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waters as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.945. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for WatersStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Life Sciences industry.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

53,376576ff-e2d7-3462-af03-eb5f6810a9d3,GM,2023-01-15,7 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy if You Don’t Think a Recession Is Coming,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-consumer-discretionary-stocks-buy-130638406.html,1673528798,STORY,"['GS', 'GM', 'SHAK', 'MGM', 'DASH']","[Every few days, I read or hear the news that strongly indicates that the U.S. is not going to undergo a recession in 2023. One of the most recent, startling headlines in this category came from Goldman Sachs, which predicted that even the eurozone would not suffer a recession this year. If the eurozone, which has been hit with far worse inflationary shocks than the U.S., is worried about a huge war near its border and has an unemployment rate that is close to double America’s is not going to experience a recession, I can’t understand how the U.S. is going to have one.Also in the shocking category was a prediction by Morgan Stanley’s Chief Economist that the American economy would grow by 0.5% this year. That’s pretty amazing because it seems that the most famous, current prognosticator of doom and gloom on the Street is Morgan Stanley’s Chief U.S. Equity Strategist, Mike Wilson. So even a colleague of the Street’s foremost bear is calling for the American economy to expand this year. Anyway, if, like me, you don’t want to ignore all of the signs that fears of a U.S. recession are way overdone, here are seven consumer discretionary stocks to buy now:TickerCompanyPriceBODYBeachbody$0.67MGMMGM$38.58EVGOEVgo$5.24DASHDoorDash$51.80BKNGBooking Holdings$2,224.81GMGeneral Motors$37.82SHAKShake Shak$53.72InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBeachbody (BODY)The Beachbody (BODY) app is displayed on an iPhone screen.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comBeachbody (NYSE:BODY) is “a health and wellness platform that provides fitness, nutrition, and stress-reducing programs.” It offers digital information on fitness and wellness, along with nutrition products and supplements. Among its products are workout videos and eating plans.As I’ve written previously, the pandemic made Americans more health-conscious, as it became more apparent to many during that time that obesity and a lack of exercise can be life threatening. BODY is very well-positioned to benefit from that trend.Story continuesMoreover, the stock’s valuation is exceptionally tiny, as the shares are trading for just 0.2 times the company’s trailing sales. And finally, the Street was apparently very pleasantly surprised by the company’s recent reiteration of its fourth-quarter guidance, as BODY stock responded to the news by rocketing 25% higher on Jan. 10.For Q4, the company expects its revenue to come in at $140 million to $150 million.In a comprehensive review of Beachbody’s 645, at-home fitness program, SI.com wrote that it will ” help you strengthen your lower body, upper body and core, it aims to build muscle and improve mobility throughout your entire bod as one big unit, preparing you for those daily life tasks that rely so heavily on functionality.”The website added that the program is fun, and SI.com did not have any major criticisms of the offering.MGM (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comIn several recent articles, I’ve recommended MGM (NYSE:MGM) stock, contending that the casino owner is very well-positioned to benefit from Las Vegas’ current and upcoming popularity.On Jan. 6, investment bank Stifel expressed similar sentiments about Las Vegas and MGM stock, as the firm upgraded its rating on MGM stock to “buy” from “hold.”The investment bank stated that “At this point we believe the LV Strip momentum should easily continue through 2023 and into 2024 and we see more value with Macau/LV Strip operators versus pure play regional gaming operators.”Like me, the firm expects MGM to get a major boost from increased business travel to the city this year. Other positive catalysts for the stock include the reopening of MGM’s casinos in China and its superior customer data, Stifel contended.Moreover, as I’ve pointed out previously, MGM expects its sports betting venture, BetMGM, to start generating positive EBITDA this year.And MGM stock currently has momentum on its side, as the shares jumped 9.3% in the five trading days that ended on Jan. 10.EVgo (EVGO)EVgo fast charging stationSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSome may oppose my decision to include electric-vehicle charger operator EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) on this list of seven consumer discretionary stocks to buy. However, buying EVs, which tend to be more expensive than their gasoline-powered counterparts, is definitely a discretionary decision, and chargers are often used on long trips, many of which are discretionary. As a result, I decided to incorporate EVGO into this column.I’ve long believed that the company, which says it has “more than 850 fast-charging statins” in the U.S., would get a big boost from the rapid proliferation of EVs. As a result, I bought the stock in 2021.And the company — which has established a close partnership with emerging EV powerhouse General Motors (NYSE:GM) — reported that its revenue jumped 70% year-over-year last quarter to $10.5 million, as it gained “approximately 54,000 new customer accounts” and the amount of electricity it provided soared 51% year-over-year.But the stock tumbled from $12.75 in March 2022 to below $4 at the end of last year.However, in a recent note to investors, investment bank MKM Partners indicated that the plunge of EVGO stock is not based on fundamentals.The firm says that a “wall of worry” among investors has been heavily weighing on the stocks of companies that, like EVgo, merged with SPACs. As a result, many names that became public by combining with stocks, including EVGO, are undervalued, MKM contended, adding that EVGO stock is ” a can’t miss.”I agree with MKM’s points, and so did many other investors, apparently, as the shares shot up 23% following the publication of the firm’s note.Moreover, 33% of EVGO’s shares are being sold short, making it an excellent candidate for a short squeeze.DoorDash (DASH)Close up of Doordash (DASH) logo and symbol displayed at the entrance to one of their officesSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIn a December note to investors, Goldman Sachs reported that food delivery had become “more normative” during the pandemic and that the trend could expand further going forward.It identified DoorDash (NYSE:DASH), the largest, pure-play food delivery company, as one of the names that could benefit significantly from the proliferation of the food delivery phenomenon.In addition, it is worth noting is that, in the third quarter, despite the curtailment of the pandemic, DoorDash’s revenue soared 34% year-over-year, while its total orders climbed 27% YOY and its cash flow from operations came in at an impressive $199 million, nearly double the $107 million of cash flow from operations that it generated during the same period a year earlier.DASH trades at a relatively low forward price-sales ratio of just 2.3 times, and nearly 9% of the shares are sold short, making it a relatively good candidate for a short squeeze going forward.Booking Holdings (BKNG)a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphoneSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comAnother key post-pandemic trend is increased spending on travel, Goldman Sachs wrote in its December note. The travel companies that are able to effectively use marketing to promote their travel offerings will probably gain the most market share, the firm predicted.That should leave Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), which owns many of the most popular online travel agencies, very well-positioned going forward. That’s because many travel companies will probably spend a great deal of money on their websites to exploit the travel boom.And as I noted in a December column, “in the third quarter, the number of hotel rooms rented through [BKNG] climbed about 8% versus Q3 of 2019, while the value of its gross bookings soared 27% versus the same period in 2019.” Moreover, George Soros, the highly successful billionaire investor, purchased 10,000 shares of the stock in Q3.BKNG has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 18.6 times.General Motors (GM)Image of the new GM logo on a smartphone with cars in the background.Source: Formatoriginal / Shutterstock.comAfter U.S. gasoline prices fell tremendously in the last few months, I believe that General Motors (NYSE:GM) is benefiting from “revenge buying” of SUVs and pickup trucks in the country.Moreover, the number of vehicles that it sold in the U.S. soared 41% year-over-year to 623,000 last year. Interestingly, last year GM sold more vehicles than any other automaker in the U.S. last year.And as Seeking Alpha explained, the automaker “credited full-size pickups and full-size SUV segments for the strong performance as these categories made up over half of the total sales for the full year.GM noted that it is now selling nine EV models, giving it the opportunity to expand its market share in the category.Furthermore, GM sold a record 16,266 EVs in Q4, and its EV sales should greatly increase this year as it produces 70,000 of its popular Bolt EVs, launches additional EV models, such as the electric version of its Silverado pickup, and consumers become more familiar with its other, existing EV offerings, including the Hummer and the Cadillac Lyriq.Shake Shack (SHAK)A Shake Shack (SHAK) restaurant in Tokyo, Japan.Source: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.comA very popular U.S. gourmet hamburger chain, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), reported its preliminary fourth quarter and full-year results on Jan. 10.The company stated that its sales had jumped to $238.5 million. Moreover, its same-store sales climbed 5.1% last quarter and 7.8% in the full year.Meanwhile, SHAK believes that its restaurant-level operating margin came in at a very strong 19% last quarter.Speaking on CNBC yesterday, the channel’s contributor, Josh Brown, who’s also an investment manager, stated that SHAK’s strong Q4 results show that it’s pleasing its customers. And I agree with that assessment.Additionally, I believe that the company is benefiting from a post-pandemic boom in restaurant spending and much stronger middle-class and upper-class consumer spending than Wall Street expects.Finally, every time I’ve gone to Shake Shack restaurants, they have been very crowded.SHAK stock has a rather low trailing price-sales ratio of 2.1 times.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in MGM and EVGO.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Snap-on:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$6.8b - US$994m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, Snap-on has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Machinery industry average of 11%.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Undervalued Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy.Mid-cap companies are some of the most attractive investment vehicles that have proven their mettle over the past few years. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, the S&amp;P MidCap 400 index has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 index for most of the past 20 years through 2015. The report says that mid-cap companies sit at a sweet spot between small caps and large caps. These companies are out of the volatility faced by small caps but have the growth potential that large caps lack. The report said that small-cap stocks have consistently outperformed large-cap stocks for most of the time frames discussed in the study, except July 1991 to March 2000, when the performance spread was negligible.Another important report by Wespath discussed the outperformance of mid-cap stocks. The report quotes a research paper by Nobel economics laureate Eugene Fama and co-author Ken French. These experts studied equities for a period starting from 1926 through 1992. The results of this research showed that over long term, small- and mid-cap stocks “consistently” outperform large-cap stocks.The Wespath report also talks about the reasons of the outperformance of small- and mid-cap stocks. Why these stocks outperform large-cap stocks over a long-term time window? Part of the reason could be the type of industries these companies operate in. Most of the mid- and small-cap companies operate in high-growth areas like software, biotech and robotics.The report also quoted an important paper published by AQR Capital Management in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2018. This paper analyzed stock returns posted in 1926 through 2012. The research found the outperformance of mid- and small-cap stocks exists especially when controlling for quality. Quality here is defined by financial data such as earnings stability, profitability, profit growth and low debt levels. That’s why in this article we will talk about some quality mid-cap stocks that are undervalued and have long-term growth potential.Story continuesOther key advantage investors enjoy while investing in mid-cap stocks is their affordable price. Since mid-cap companies have market caps between $2 billion to $10 billion, these companies don’t have exorbitantly high stock prices, as you will see in this article. These companies, if chosen wisely, offer higher upside and growth potential when compared to large-cap stocks which have, in many cases, already rewarded their early investors.Our MethodologyFor this article, we first screened for stocks that have a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion, PE ratio under 15 and PEG ratio under 1 as of January 12.

62,596010a9-75d0-32b9-8052-117d3468a43d,NVDA,2023-01-15,10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-biggest-buybacks-165255288.html,1673715175,STORY,"['NVDA', '^GSPC', 'PG', 'CVX', 'GOOGL', 'MPC', 'LOW']","[In this article, we take a look at 10 stocks with the biggest buybacks. If you want to see more stocks with the biggest buybacks, go directly to 5 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.When they generate a profit, companies can choose to keep the profits on their balance sheet, invest the profits back into the company, use the profits to buy other companies, or return the profits back to shareholders.In terms of returning profits back to shareholders, the two main ways companies return capital back to shareholders is through stock buybacks and dividends.When it comes to whether companies should return capital through buybacks or through dividends, both have their advantages and disadvantages.Whereas many shareholders would not be happy if a company were to cut its regular dividend, most investors don't expect companies to buy back their stock regularly. As a result, stock buybacks offer management more flexibility than dividends. Stock buybacks have historically also been taxed less than dividends as well although different investors have different tax rates.Stock buybacks can add value if done correctly as they can increase earnings per share if a company maintains its profits. If a company earns $1 per share, for instance, and the company buys back half of its stock and doesn't issue new shares, that company would then earn $2 per share. If that company's P/E valuation stays the same, its stock could potentially rise substantially as a result and generate a total return of potentially more than if the same company were to return the same amount of capital through a dividend.Stock buybacks can also destroy value if done incorrectly. If a company's management buys back its stock at too high of a price, shareholders would have been better off if management had paid a dividend instead.Given the advantages and disadvantages of stock buybacks and dividends, many companies have chosen to return capital through both. In terms of recent years, however, companies in the S&amp;P 500 in aggregate have returned more capital through stock buybacks than through dividends.Story continuesBuybacksIn terms of recent buybacks versus dividends, total aggregate buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 for Q3 2022 were $210.8 billion, down 10.1% from Q3 2021's $234.6 billion. By comparison total Q3 2022 dividends paid were $140.3 billion, up from $130 billion in Q3 2021.In Q3 2022, 319 companies in the S&amp;P 500 bought back stock of at least $5 million in the quarter, up from 309 in Q3 2021.In terms of taxes, 2023 is a new year with new rules when it comes to stock buybacks.As a result of the inflation reduction act of 2022, there will be a 1% excise tax on the repurchases of stocks after December 31, 2022.Many believe there could be slightly less buybacks and potentially more dividends as a result.Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMethodologyFor our list of 10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks, we used preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data for Q3 2022 from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we ranked them based on their Q3 2022 buybacks.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database of 920 funds that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks10. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,697 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Given the Russia Ukraine war, oil and gas prices have increased from 2021 levels and many big oil companies have benefited with bigger profits. In the third quarter of 2022, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) adjusted earnings surged to $10.8 billion versus adjusted earnings of $5.7 billion in Q3 2021 as a result.Given the profit increases and substantial free cash flow, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) paid dividends of $2.7 billion and also repurchased around $3.7 billion of shares in the quarter. Considering strong earnings in Q2 2022, the company in July boosted the top end of its annual share repurchase guidance range to $15 billion. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s previous annual buyback guidance was $5 billion to $10 billion.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a stock that is owned by many hedge funds in our database that repurchased a lot of shares in Q3.9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,779 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Given the company doesn't have a substantial dividend yield, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has returned most of its excess capital through buybacks in recent years. Considering its profits have increased substantially given demand growth for GPUs, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) board of directors in May of 2022 increased and extended the company's repurchase program to up to $15 billion through December 2023. With the buyback authorization, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) bought back nearly $3.8 billion worth of shares in Q3, ranking the company #9 on our list of 10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.Baron Funds commented on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in a Q3 investor letter,“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”8. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,908 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) bought back over $3.9 billion worth of its own shares in the third quarter as it completed its $15 billion return of capital commitment in October utilizing proceeds from its Speedway divestiture. In 2021, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) sold Speedway to 7-Eleven for an estimated $16.5 billion of after-tax cash proceeds. As a result of its buyback program, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) repurchased around 30% of its outstanding shares. After completing its $15 billion return of capital commitment, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) has approximately $5 billion remaining available under its current share repurchase authorizations.7. Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,999 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) has one of the biggest buyback authorizations among retailers after its board of directors announced a $15 billion buyback authorization with no expiration date. The company also still has $6.4 billion left on its previous buyback program as of December 2022. As far as buybacks go, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) bought back a lot of stock in Q3, with repurchases of nearly $4 billion. If it can increase earnings and not issue any new shares, the buybacks could help increase EPS for Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in the long term.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $4,000 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69While it is more famous for its dividend given the consumer staple's long history of increasing it every year, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has also returned a lot of capital back to shareholders through share repurchases.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Is Seagate Technology Holdings Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$848.0mUS$1.28bUS$1.45bUS$1.60bUS$1.77bUS$1.89bUS$1.99bUS$2.08bUS$2.15bUS$2.22bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.85%Est @ 5.39%Est @ 4.37%Est @ 3.65%Est @ 3.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 13% US$753US$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$998US$977US$927US$868US$805US$741US$679(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.8bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 13%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (13%– 2.0%) = US$21bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$21b÷ ( 1 + 13%)10= US$6.5bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$15b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$57.3, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Seagate Technology Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 13%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.513. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Seagate Technology HoldingsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

However, the report presented a skeptical view on global growth due to the re-emergence of Covid in China and the ongoing natural gas crisis in Europe. In the current market situation, investors expect defensive value stocks to hold the reins this year as recession fears will continue to haunt the stock market.Over the years, high-quality growth stocks outperformed value equities. However, with the tech sell-off last year, value investing gained traction among investors. In Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in the first week of January 2023, 54% of respondents mentioned that they are inclined to invest more in value stocks this year, up from 39% three months ago. Another survey by CNBC revealed that 72% of the participants will prefer value over growth this year. Last year’s returns also showed the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In 2022, the Russell 1000 Value Index fell by 7.5%, compared with a much harsh decline of 29.1% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Analysts expect the value investing trend to continue this year as well. Sarah Ketterer, a chief executive of Causeway Capital Management, spoke to The Street about the investment outlook in 2023. She asserted that stable interest rates would bode well for value stocks. She also mentioned that while investing in value stocks, investors should also consider the return on capital like dividends and buybacks.Dividend stocks also reported strong performance in 2022 as investors preferred income-generating stocks. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed over $561 billion in dividends last year, up from $511.2 billion in 2021, as reported by Wall Street Journal. Among these companies, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) remained popular among investors as these companies have shown solid dividend growth over the years.Story continues11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy NowPhoto by buian_photos on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below have raised their dividends for 25 years or more.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Largest Orthopedic Companies in the World.The orthopedic industry has staged a comeback in the last two years following a dismal 2020 due to the lockdowns and restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021, the orthopedic industry saw its annual top line increase by 12.8% year-over-year (YoY) or $6.1 billion to $53.6 billion. The orthopedic industry has also faced supply-chain-related challenges. However, experts still anticipate YoY growth of 3.2% in 2022 to take the orthopedic industry sales to $55.3 billion. The growth rate for 2022 is in-line with the historical growth before the COVID-19 pandemic.It must be noted that the top 25 largest orthopedic companies in the world account for 80% of the industry’s top line. Amongst the top 25 companies, there is a significant variance as Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) leads the industry with annual revenue of $8.9 billion. Meanwhile, SeaSpine occupies the position of the 25th largest orthopedic company in the world, with an annual top line of $191 million. The global orthopedic industry comprises more than 1,000 companies. The industry can be broken down into five key segments, namely joint replacement, ortho biologics, spine, sports medicine, and trauma. Amongst these segments, joint replacement is the biggest, with total revenue of $19.42 billion in 2021. The top 25 companies have an 87.8% market share in this segment. Meanwhile, the smallest segment in the orthopedic industry is the ortho biologics segment, with a total top line of $5.22 billion as of 2021. The top 25 companies have a 59.8% market share in this segment.The recovery of the orthopedic industry hinges on important market forces. The first market force is related to hospital staffing issues. The COVID-19 pandemic created a shortage of healthcare resources, dampening the road to recovery for the orthopedic industry. Another key market force is the global supply chain challenges, while the third market force is the slow decline in the procedure backlog. Experts anticipate the procedure backlog to ease in late 2022 and early 2023 as the challenges related to hospital staffing and supply chain ease. Some of the largest orthopedic companies in the world include Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), and Smith &amp; Nephew plc (NYSE:SNN).Story continues15 Largest Orthopedic Companies in the Worldegyjanek/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyIn this article, we will discuss the 15 largest orthopedic companies in the world based on their orthopedic revenue in 2021.

(NASDAQ:VRSN) Worth US$214 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verisign-inc-nasdaq-vrsn-worth-142307643.html,1673706187,STORY,['VRSN'],"[Does the January share price for VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for VeriSign The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$858.0mUS$940.8mUS$1.01bUS$1.05bUS$1.11bUS$1.16bUS$1.20bUS$1.24bUS$1.27bUS$1.31bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.23%Est @ 3.56%Est @ 3.08%Est @ 2.75%Est @ 2.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$793US$804US$800US$769US$752US$724US$693US$660US$627US$594(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.2bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$21bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$21b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$9.7bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$17b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$214, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at VeriSign as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.035. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for VeriSignStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

However, the report presented a skeptical view on global growth due to the re-emergence of Covid in China and the ongoing natural gas crisis in Europe. In the current market situation, investors expect defensive value stocks to hold the reins this year as recession fears will continue to haunt the stock market.Over the years, high-quality growth stocks outperformed value equities. However, with the tech sell-off last year, value investing gained traction among investors. In Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in the first week of January 2023, 54% of respondents mentioned that they are inclined to invest more in value stocks this year, up from 39% three months ago. Another survey by CNBC revealed that 72% of the participants will prefer value over growth this year. Last year’s returns also showed the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In 2022, the Russell 1000 Value Index fell by 7.5%, compared with a much harsh decline of 29.1% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Analysts expect the value investing trend to continue this year as well. Sarah Ketterer, a chief executive of Causeway Capital Management, spoke to The Street about the investment outlook in 2023. She asserted that stable interest rates would bode well for value stocks. She also mentioned that while investing in value stocks, investors should also consider the return on capital like dividends and buybacks.Dividend stocks also reported strong performance in 2022 as investors preferred income-generating stocks. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed over $561 billion in dividends last year, up from $511.2 billion in 2021, as reported by Wall Street Journal.

If you want to see more stocks with the biggest buybacks, go directly to 5 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.When they generate a profit, companies can choose to keep the profits on their balance sheet, invest the profits back into the company, use the profits to buy other companies, or return the profits back to shareholders.In terms of returning profits back to shareholders, the two main ways companies return capital back to shareholders is through stock buybacks and dividends.When it comes to whether companies should return capital through buybacks or through dividends, both have their advantages and disadvantages.Whereas many shareholders would not be happy if a company were to cut its regular dividend, most investors don't expect companies to buy back their stock regularly. As a result, stock buybacks offer management more flexibility than dividends. Stock buybacks have historically also been taxed less than dividends as well although different investors have different tax rates.Stock buybacks can add value if done correctly as they can increase earnings per share if a company maintains its profits. If a company earns $1 per share, for instance, and the company buys back half of its stock and doesn't issue new shares, that company would then earn $2 per share. If that company's P/E valuation stays the same, its stock could potentially rise substantially as a result and generate a total return of potentially more than if the same company were to return the same amount of capital through a dividend.Stock buybacks can also destroy value if done incorrectly. If a company's management buys back its stock at too high of a price, shareholders would have been better off if management had paid a dividend instead.Given the advantages and disadvantages of stock buybacks and dividends, many companies have chosen to return capital through both. In terms of recent years, however, companies in the S&amp;P 500 in aggregate have returned more capital through stock buybacks than through dividends.Story continuesBuybacksIn terms of recent buybacks versus dividends, total aggregate buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 for Q3 2022 were $210.8 billion, down 10.1% from Q3 2021's $234.6 billion. By comparison total Q3 2022 dividends paid were $140.3 billion, up from $130 billion in Q3 2021.In Q3 2022, 319 companies in the S&amp;P 500 bought back stock of at least $5 million in the quarter, up from 309 in Q3 2021.In terms of taxes, 2023 is a new year with new rules when it comes to stock buybacks.As a result of the inflation reduction act of 2022, there will be a 1% excise tax on the repurchases of stocks after December 31, 2022.Many believe there could be slightly less buybacks and potentially more dividends as a result.Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMethodologyFor our list of 10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks, we used preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data for Q3 2022 from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we ranked them based on their Q3 2022 buybacks.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database of 920 funds that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks10. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,697 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Given the Russia Ukraine war, oil and gas prices have increased from 2021 levels and many big oil companies have benefited with bigger profits. In the third quarter of 2022, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) adjusted earnings surged to $10.8 billion versus adjusted earnings of $5.7 billion in Q3 2021 as a result.Given the profit increases and substantial free cash flow, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) paid dividends of $2.7 billion and also repurchased around $3.7 billion of shares in the quarter. Considering strong earnings in Q2 2022, the company in July boosted the top end of its annual share repurchase guidance range to $15 billion. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s previous annual buyback guidance was $5 billion to $10 billion.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a stock that is owned by many hedge funds in our database that repurchased a lot of shares in Q3.9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,779 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Given the company doesn't have a substantial dividend yield, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has returned most of its excess capital through buybacks in recent years. Considering its profits have increased substantially given demand growth for GPUs, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) board of directors in May of 2022 increased and extended the company's repurchase program to up to $15 billion through December 2023. With the buyback authorization, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) bought back nearly $3.8 billion worth of shares in Q3, ranking the company #9 on our list of 10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.Baron Funds commented on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in a Q3 investor letter,“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”8. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,908 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) bought back over $3.9 billion worth of its own shares in the third quarter as it completed its $15 billion return of capital commitment in October utilizing proceeds from its Speedway divestiture.

However, the report presented a skeptical view on global growth due to the re-emergence of Covid in China and the ongoing natural gas crisis in Europe. In the current market situation, investors expect defensive value stocks to hold the reins this year as recession fears will continue to haunt the stock market.Over the years, high-quality growth stocks outperformed value equities. However, with the tech sell-off last year, value investing gained traction among investors. In Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in the first week of January 2023, 54% of respondents mentioned that they are inclined to invest more in value stocks this year, up from 39% three months ago. Another survey by CNBC revealed that 72% of the participants will prefer value over growth this year. Last year’s returns also showed the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In 2022, the Russell 1000 Value Index fell by 7.5%, compared with a much harsh decline of 29.1% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Analysts expect the value investing trend to continue this year as well. Sarah Ketterer, a chief executive of Causeway Capital Management, spoke to The Street about the investment outlook in 2023. She asserted that stable interest rates would bode well for value stocks. She also mentioned that while investing in value stocks, investors should also consider the return on capital like dividends and buybacks.Dividend stocks also reported strong performance in 2022 as investors preferred income-generating stocks. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed over $561 billion in dividends last year, up from $511.2 billion in 2021, as reported by Wall Street Journal. Among these companies, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) remained popular among investors as these companies have shown solid dividend growth over the years.Story continues11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy NowPhoto by buian_photos on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below have raised their dividends for 25 years or more.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) share price is up 94% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 37% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 17%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals managed to grow its earnings per share at 33% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 14% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 17% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 14% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals .Story continuesWe will like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals better if we see some big insider buys.

As a result, customers receive faster value sooner.Story continuesAmdocs is quick to respond to changing production environments. For example, it brought a product to market after closely monitoring what its customers needed. In managed services, Amdocs is pushing out products that customer renewal rates are high. Managed services grew by 12% in the fourth quarter.The company has a 12-month backlog. The solid pipeline will cushion the business from any unlikely slowdowns. Customers might delay signing agreements as they look for lower spending.

Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares recently indicated a double-bottom support pattern on the chart at $25. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the high single digits, markets are discounting the chip giant’s prospects.PC sales cratered in the last few quarters. Demand peaked during the pandemic, after which consumers and corporations stopped upgrading machines. Intel is unfazed. It is investing heavily in manufacturing around the world. Eventually, the chip cycle will recover and demand will exceed supply. For example, the company is building a factory in Germany. Although it delayed those plans, it wants more subsidies to lower costs.At Computer Electronics Show 2013, Intel introduced a mobile processor that has 24 cores and runs at 5.6GHz. This solidifies Intel’s dominance in the laptop market. The company also debuted processors that support endurance gaming.Intel’s Movidius vision processing unit will support artificial intelligence-heavy tasks that professional workers demand.

It produces potash and nitrogen fertilizer. Last week, fertilizer prices sank to almost two-year lows, alongside the drop in natural gas prices.NTR stock pays a 48-cent quarterly dividend. It rewards income investors while allocating the rest of its cash flow to expand potash production. In 2022, a compressed planting season distorted potash demand. Still, inventory levels fell. The company expects the sector to replenish inventories, especially in North America and Brazil.Farmers purchased fewer Nutrien products due to unfavorable prices. As prices come down, they will step up to accumulate the fertilizer. That way, they have more than enough material to fulfill their application season.Nutrien expects to ramp up production to around 18 million tons by 2025. It is highly convinced it will sell the increased volumes as demand more than exceeds supply.NTR stock trades at a P/E of around 4 times.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) continued to innovate its mobile chip offering.

Since October 2022, the stock fell below $110 only to bounce back. Wall Street analysts are bracing for an earnings-per-share (EPS) growth rate in the low- to mid-single digits in the next three to five years.Last year, smartphone demand fell. Consumers are sensitive to inflationary pressures which hurt their disposable income. The market’s anticipation of slow smartphone sales is hurting Qualcomm’s share price. Value investors may take advantage of the discount by accumulating the stock in the next few months.To broaden its market beyond phones, Qualcomm announced Snapdragon AR2 for augmented reality glasses. The platform uses 50% less power than the previous generation XR2 Gen 1 platform. In addition, it has 250% more artificial intelligence performance.
