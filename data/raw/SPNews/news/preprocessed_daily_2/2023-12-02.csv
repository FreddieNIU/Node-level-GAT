Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Looking at Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Texas Instruments is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.27 = US$7.7b ÷ (US$32b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 27%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 11%."", ' View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Texas Instruments compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""When we looked at the ROCE trend at Texas Instruments, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 42% where it was five years ago. Given the business is employing more capital while revenue has slipped, this is a bit concerning. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased."", ""From the above analysis, we find it rather worrisome that returns on capital and sales for Texas Instruments have fallen, meanwhile the business is employing more capital than it was five years ago. But investors must be expecting an improvement of sorts because over the last five yearsthe stock has delivered a respectable 93% return. In any case, the current underlying trends don't bode well for long term performance so unless they reverse, we'd start looking elsewhere."", ""Texas Instruments does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those can't be ignored..."", ""If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here."", 'Have feedback on this article?

ARE have rallied 11.8% over the past month compared with the industry's growth of 7.5%.Alexandria owns Class A/A+ properties in the AAA innovation cluster locations of North America, with significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and the Research Triangle.These locations are highly appealing to life science, agtech and technology companies seeking tenancy. Moreover, they are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants and a limited supply of available space."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Given the booming demand for life-science assets on the back of the increasing need for drug research and innovation, the company continues to witness healthy demand and maintain high occupancy levels.', 'In the third quarter, total leasing activity aggregated 867,582 RSF of space, of which lease renewals and re-leasing of space amounted to 396,334 RSF. Rental rate growth was 28.8% or 19.7% on a cash basis.The occupancy of operating properties in North America remained high at 93.7% as of Sep 30, 2023. For 2023, we expect Alexandria’s same-store occupancy to be 94.1%With artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools being implemented in this industry, AI-focused life science companies require a significant lab footprint to generate the immense biological and chemical datasets needed to train AI-ML models effectively. This is likely to emerge as a key demand driver for Alexandria’s life-science assets in the upcoming period.Alexandria enjoys a solid tenant base of around 825 diversified high-quality companies ranging from multinational pharmaceutical companies, public and private biotechnology companies, manufacturers of complex medicines and top-tier investment-grade companies and institutions as well as technology entities.These tenants mainly rely on a central lab-based infrastructure to optimize their research capabilities and workflow, making it difficult for them to switch locations frequently. Notably, in the last 12 months, 80% of ARE’s leasing activity was generated from its existing client base.As a result, the company is generally able to command high rents at its properties, aiding steady revenues over the long term. We estimate rental income to increase 9.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2023.Alexandria’s acquisition, development and redevelopment of new Class A/A+ properties in AAA locations to enhance its operating platform bode well for long-term growth. Its pipeline of current and near-term projects is expected to generate annual incremental net operating income of $580 million through the third quarter of 2026, which is encouraging.In addition, as part of the company’s capital-recycling efforts, it aims to achieve dispositions and sales of partial interests target of $1.65 billion in 2023 and is well on track.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company maintains a robust balance sheet position, supporting its growth endeavors. This has enabled it to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. It exited the third quarter of 2023 with $6.9 billion of liquidity. It has no debt maturities prior to 2025 and its weighted-average remaining term was 13.1 years.Moreover, in September and October 2023, ARE received reaffirmations on its credit ratings of Baa1/Stable and BBB+/Positive from Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings, respectively. This renders access to the debt market at favorable costs.For 2023, expecting to benefit from the flourishing life-science market, the company revised its 2023 guidance for AFFO per share to $8.97-$8.99 from $8.93-$8.99 estimated earlier, representing a 2-cent increase at the midpoint to $8.98. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $8.97, within expectations.Nonetheless, Alexandria’s substantial active development and redevelopment pipeline, although encouraging for long-term growth, increases the risks related to cost overruns and lease-up concerns amid the current macroeconomic scenario and a high interest rate environment.Further, with high interest rates in place, the company may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are EastGroup Properties EGP, Stag Industrial STAG and Park Hotels & Resorts PK, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

With a history that spans over 170 years, Unum Group has established a reputation for reliability and service, catering to millions of customers worldwide."", ""The recent sale by Puneet Bhasin of 8,188 shares has added to a pattern of insider trading activity at Unum Group. Over the past year, Bhasin has sold a total of 22,797 shares and has not made any purchases. This one-sided transaction history could suggest a lack of confidence in the company's short-term growth prospects or simply a personal financial decision by the insider.When examining the broader insider trends at Unum Group, there has been a predominance of selling over buying, with 10 insider sells and only 1 insider buy over the past year. This trend could be interpreted in various ways; however, it often raises questions among investors about the internal perspective on the company's valuation and future performance."", ""On the day of Bhasin's recent sale, Unum Group's shares were trading at $42.39, giving the company a market cap of $8.402 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 6.96, which is lower than both the industry median of 10.87 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This could indicate that the stock is undervalued based on earnings, potentially offering an attractive entry point for value investors.However, with a price of $42.39 and a GuruFocus Value of $35.21, Unum Group has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.2, suggesting that the stock is modestly overvalued based on its GF Value. The GF Value is a proprietary intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, which takes into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates from analysts."", ""The relationship between insider selling and stock price is complex and not always directly correlated. While insider sales can sometimes lead to negative market sentiment, they do not necessarily predict a decline in stock price. In the case of Unum Group, the stock's modest overvaluation according to the GF Value may be a factor in the insider's decision to sell, but it is also important to consider the broader market conditions and company fundamentals when assessing the potential impact on the stock price."", ""The insider trading activity of Puneet Bhasin at Unum Group, particularly the recent sale of 8,188 shares, is a development that warrants attention from investors. While the insider's actions may raise questions about the stock's valuation and future prospects, it is essential to analyze these moves within the context of the company's overall financial health and market conditions. As with any investment decision, a comprehensive approach that considers multiple factors will provide the most balanced perspective on the potential risks and rewards associated with Unum Group's stock."", 'Warning!

At this time, I'm pleased to turn the conference over to Stefan Larsson."", 'Stefan Larsson : Thank you, Sheryl, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. For the third quarter, we drove strong performance led by the strength of our two global iconic brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. And our disciplined execution of brand building growth plan, the PVH+ Plan. Despite an increasingly choppy macro backdrop, particularly in Europe, we grew overall revenue in line with guidance, up 4% on a reported basis and up 1% in constant currency, while expanding our gross margins, and we beat our guidance for the bottom line. We drove high single-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business with growth across both brands in all regions. This included double-digit growth in our owned and operated e-commerce and mid-single-digit growth in our stores.', ""Partially offsetting the strength in B2C trends, we experienced incrementally more challenging trends in wholesale brought by the tougher macro environment. As a company, we are driving a much more profitable business. On a non-GAAP basis, in Q3, we grew EBIT by 13% versus last year with strong margin expansion. And in Q4, we project to grow EBIT by over 30% versus last year, with an approximate 12% EBIT margin. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming our EBIT margin, and we are increasing our EPS guidance by $0.10 for the full year on a non-GAAP basis. By focusing on what's within our control for the full year 2023, we remain well-positioned to buy meaningful margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth. We just came out of the important Thanksgiving and Black Friday week, one of the key consumer moments during the holiday period."", ""And I'm pleased to share that in both North America and Europe, we beat our growth plans versus last year and delivered a strong start of the holiday season. We continue to make strong progress and gain increasing traction across all five growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan. And we relentlessly lean into the execution on winning with product, winning with consumer engagement, winning in the marketplace, as well as developing a data and demand-driven supply chain and investing in growth while driving efficiencies. And as I mentioned on our last call, each of our growth drivers plays an important role. And it's when we play them all together, that's something really powerful happens. And let me share some concrete examples on how we made that come to life this quarter."", 'First, our strong D2C growth was fueled by increased product and supply chain strength that drove higher gross margins. The sales growth was supported by a nearly 20% increase in marketing investments with strong cut-through campaigns and global talent amplification. From a regional perspective, we drove constant currency revenue growth for our combined Calvin and Tommy businesses for all regions. Our outperformance in the quarter was driven by North America, which is a very important proof point for how we are already positioning both Calvin and Tommy for long-term sustainable growth in the region through strong execution of the PVH+ Plan. For the second consecutive quarter, our EBIT margin for our Calvin and Tommy businesses in North America together took a sizable step forward and expanded to 13.1% in the quarter, with significant gross margin expansion in both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale business.', ""Inventory continues to be in great shape, both in composition and in levels, down 19% at the end of the quarter, as we made significant progress increasing overall inventory productivity as part of our actions to lower inventory in relation to sales by 25% by the end of fiscal 2024, all while improving availability. For the first half of 2024, we also see decreases in our AUC with more than 5%. This is partly driven by favorable macro but even more importantly, it's driven by an improved approach to our costing process, the first results of a better raw material strategy and early returns on a much sharper assortment productivity. We continue to invest in growth while driving cost efficiencies and are improving our cash flow, increasing share buybacks, showing our confidence in our ability to execute over the long term."", ""During the quarter, we further sharpened our focus on our two core brands with the divestiture of heritage brands. The proceeds from the transaction will be used to repurchase stock and we now expect to repurchase approximately $550 million of our stock, up from $400 million previously. Finally, it will be the strength of our brands, our consistency in direction, and our relentless execution of the PVH+ Plan that will set us apart over time. And this will, in turn, be driven by the quality of the management team, which we have strengthened significantly over the past year. I'm happy to share the addition of Leah Goldman, who will join us as Global Brand President of Tommy Hilfiger in spring 2024. Lea is a uniquely strong and experienced brand and business builder with an outstanding track record building brands globally."", ""Under Leah's leadership, the Tommy Hilfiger brand will operate in the same way our global Calvin Klein business operates today under Eva Serrano, creating a consistent and unified global brand structure. Each of our two brands now has one leader who sets the vision, leads product creation, brand marketing, and consumer experience globally, working closely with our regional teams who inform those strategies and lead the brand to win in the marketplace. Now let me share a bit more of what drove our performance in the quarter, both from a global brand and regional perspective. Starting with Calvin Klein. Throughout the third quarter, Calvin continued to focus on driving very strong consumer engagement globally through our most important hero products and driving a strong category offers with growth across our refined performance and underwear categories."", ""It was another quarter where we delivered cut-through campaigns globally and continued to amplify our talent partnerships. When we last spoke, the brand has just launched its fall campaign, which included our long-term ambassadors, Jennicam, John Cook, Kendall Jenner, wearing our most essential underwear, denim, and refined women's wear styles. Cut through with nearly 4 million average video views on TikTok and over 20% engagement rate on Instagram. As part of the fall campaign, the brand also launched a surprise performance with John Cook in Times Square New York. The concept was announced only 30 minutes beforehand and tens of thousands of fans gathered within minutes. John Cook and his whole crew were dressed in iconic Calvin Klein, and their locks were immediately shoppable on our side."", ""It was a perfect example on how we amplify global talent win with consumer engagement. For holiday, the brand campaign features Haley Beaver in iconic Calvin Klein stars, where our hero products are prominently featured on social through shoppable content to drive commercial impact. Finally, I'm excited about the progress we are making to align Calvin Klein to one global brand vision. Since joining, Eva has been focused on tapping into Calvin's core DNA to make the brand more current than ever. As part of this work, we are expanding the capabilities of our global product teams here in New York, to drive a more unified product vision across key categories to win serving all markets. Let me now share a few examples from Tommy Hilfiger. This fall, the Tommy brand reinforced its core DNA."", ""Going back to classic American cool and iconic Tommy Lifestyle through our family-focused seasonal campaign. As part of this campaign with a special focus on Asia, we celebrated the K-Pop band Straight Kids VMA win with a warm welcome to the Tommy family, breaking our record of social media engagement in the first 30 minutes. When we connect the brand in authentic ways with global talent like this, our fans respond, and we expand our reach and influence. We combined another culturally relevant moment with aspirational talent when Tommy campaign Star CISA, hosted a New York Fashion Week brunch with over 100 VIP guests and influencers generating over 800 million impressions on social. And just two weeks ago, at the Las Vegas Formula One Grand Prix, we expanded our partnership with Formula One by welcoming one of Hollywood's biggest rising stars, Damson Idris, to the Tommy Hilfiger brand family as our newest men's ambassador."", ""Together with Damson, Tommy hosted a number of events with key influencers featuring day and night Tommy looks. For the holiday, our Tommy campaign celebrates the happiness of returning home, families and friends are captured in Tommy's classic American prep with the twist as they unite to celebrate the season, all amplified by very strong talent. Now let me turn to our regional performance. I'd like to start with North America, which is a big proof point for us this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we made significant progress building the foundation for sustainable, increasingly profitable brand accretive growth for the region, and I'm very encouraged by the major initial traction we are gaining. Our Tommy and Calvin businesses together delivered high-quality, low single-digit revenue growth and most importantly, a 13.1% EBIT margin in the quarter, including higher gross margins and higher AURs. We drove outperformance for both our direct-to-consumer businesses and our wholesale business, which showed meaningful sequential improvement, and this is with still a big part of the pre-pandemic tourism, not yet back."", ""Let me share a few highlights. For Tommy, our D2C growth continues to be driven by our best premium Style Essentials, which increased by over 50% compared to last year, supported by elevated in-store execution. For Calvin, leading with our category offense, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the refined category, the expanded Essentials focus was also once again a standout, supported by an integrated marketing campaign and elevated execution on CK.com. Across both brands, we drove another quarter of double-digit growth in our owned and operated e-commerce businesses. This was driven by the elevation of our brands through stronger storytelling improved site merchandising and new conversion tools. Within wholesale, while our partners remain conservative we continue to see strong gains resulting from our efforts to build a much stronger business with our key partners such as Macy's."", ""Let me share some examples. We drove double-digit year-over-year growth in Tommy test stores, where we have invested together with Macy's in stronger field team coverage. And we are driving double-digit AUR growth at Macy's through the ongoing success with our improved product assortment, including our Polo offense and seasonal categories. For Calvin, our men's Essentials business increased over 50% at Macy's with investments in the right premium essential base assortment. We also saw strength in refined categories, which grew 25%. I'm very proud of our North American team's execution this past quarter, and we now have the team, the plan, and the disciplined execution in place to unlock our full potential in the region. Turning to Europe. We continue to drive growth this quarter, building on our historically large business, market-leading awareness, and overall brand strength in the region."", ""In the third quarter, we delivered high single-digit revenue growth on a reported basis and low single-digit growth in euros against a record-breaking quarter last year. Our revenue exceeded EUR1 billion, led by mid-single-digit growth in D2C for each brand. In wholesale, we confirmed our pre-spring '24 order book at low single-digit growth on a constant currency basis with pre-spring already shipping in Q3, leading to timing differences versus Q4 last year. Like others, we have seen a more challenging macroeconomic backdrop in Europe, and that is impacting consumer confidence and the wholesale channel. Additionally, this quarter, just as we were about to kick off the fall season, we saw the longest streak of record-setting warm weather in Europe since the 1800s."", ""Both factors have driven an increasingly promotional environment in the marketplace. And for us, the heat wave in September was a double whammy, given our historical strength in outerwear, sweaters, and heavyweight nets. Weather aside, going forward, we anticipate this challenging macro backdrop and an increasingly cautious wholesale channel to continue into 2024. In this environment, we are not sitting still. We are leveraging our market-leading strength, and driving much-increased profitability and proactively adjusting how we operate. We're taking our PVH+ Plan execution to the next level, and we are doing this in two main ways. First, against the current macro backdrop in the wholesale channel, we feel that it's critically important to avoid having too much inventory in the market."", ""Even if that means less selling in to secure strong sellout with high margin and less discounting. Our main priority independent of macro for both brands will always be to strengthen our position for long-term sustainable brand accretive growth. Second, we will lean into the next level of PVH+ execution through DTC and with our key wholesale partners, leveraging our key strengths in product, consumer engagement, and marketplace management. I'll highlight a few examples of how you will see this in action. Across both brands, we have product innovation coming for 2024. In technical fabrics, dress casual, more choice of our best premium essentials, more transitional products to become less weather dependent and all while we continue to cut the unproductive assortment tail."", 'In consumer engagement, we just shot very strong cut-through campaigns for both Tommy and Calvin that we launch for Spring 2024. And in the marketplace, you will see us continue to invest in our stores, shop-in-shops, and digital experiences to keep elevating the consumer experience. You can already see the positive effects of our next level PVH+ execution in our D2C channels, where we have more control between product and consumer and can execute with impact more quickly. And in wholesale, thanks to the much-improved inventory management this season, despite the tougher conditions, you will already in Q4 be able to see a significantly improved profitability versus the same quarter last year. I have personally spent more time in Europe over the past few months.', ""I visited over 50 stores in six countries to work with our teams as we adjust to market conditions and put the next level of PVH+ execution into action. Standing out the most from this work is the foundational strength we have in both brands with consumers across the region and the opportunity to continue leveraging this as we navigate the current environment. Moving on to Asia Pacific. We continue to drive strong performance, which included double-digit constant currency growth in our direct-to-consumer businesses across the region, including China. We continue to win in key consumer moments such as Chinese Valentine's Day and Tmall membership day, fueled by strong hero products and successful capsule launches. And both Calvin and Tommy continue to move up to rankers on Tmall."", ""Most recently, we delivered double-digit growth in GMV during China's important 11-11 activation. Leading with a product category offers, we focused on growing live stream sales and leveraging talent in innovative and engaging ways. We also captured market share on Douyin as consumers increase spending on these newer formats of shopping. We leveraged our global mega talent to expand brand awareness in the region. In October, Calvin celebrated fall 2023 collection in Tokyo, featuring brand ambassador John Cook, the ventral strong brand awareness across the region and globally. And Tommy's fall campaign reached a total fan base of over 130 million with regionally relevant ambassadors, including top group kids, in addition to new ambassadors, Lee Chen and Greg Su, who drove over 430 million impressions in China alone during the campaign period."", 'Overall, we are doing a great job executing the PVH+ Plan in the region, and we are very optimistic of the long-term growth opportunity for both of our brands. In closing, I feel very good about the strong performance we delivered in the quarter and how we keep gaining traction through our brand-building PVH+ execution. Before I turn the call over to Zac, I would like to thank all of our associates around the world for their hard work and important contributions this year. And I wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season.', 'Zac Coughlin : Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased with our results for the quarter, driven by our iconic brands and disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan. We continue to build on our track record of performance, delivering our top-line guidance while exceeding bottom-line guidance as we compete to win in this highly dynamic global environment. We delivered revenue growth of 4% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis, in line with our guidance with significant strength in DTC and in spite of an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment, especially in Europe. On the bottom line, we once again exceeded our earnings guidance with earnings per share of $2.90, driven by strong expense management.', 'We delivered operating margin of 10.5% for the quarter, up 90 basis points versus last year, delivering on our commitment of sequential second-half improvement. Also, importantly, our inventory at quarter end is down 19% compared to last year as we continue to proactively manage our inventory levels. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to end the year with inventory significantly lower than last year, with improvement to continue through 2024 as we make progress on our previously announced goal of a 25% reduction in inventory as a percentage of sales. We also completed the sale of our Heritage Brands intimate apparel business earlier this week for $160 million in cash, which was yet another important step as we accelerate our focus on our core global brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.', 'We plan to utilize approximately $150 million of net proceeds from the sale for share repurchases in 2023. This increases our planned share buybacks for the year to approximately $550 million compared to up to $400 million previously. We expect the sale to be slightly accretive to our operating margin in 2024. As we head into the fourth quarter, we see continued strength in our DTC business and also expect pressure in the wholesale business to continue. This is especially true in Europe as the macro environment continues to be challenging, exacerbated by record-high temperatures in September, as Stefan discussed, causing retailers to take a cautious approach. This as well as the impact from the sale of our Heritage Brands intimate apparel business is reflected in our revised revenue outlook of 1% growth for the year on both a reported and constant currency basis.', 'Our prior guidance was an increase of 3% to 4% as reported and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. On the bottom line, we are reaffirming our approximately 10% operating margin outlook and increasing our non-GAAP EPS outlook for the year to a record high $10.45 compared to $10.35 previously, despite our lower revenue outlook, as we further strengthen our focus on driving profitable sales and disciplined cost management. I will now discuss third quarter results in more detail and then move on to our outlook. Revenue was up 4% for the quarter, which reflected a 3% positive impact from exchange. Third quarter revenue for our international businesses was up 1% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in our European business was up 1% in euros despite the increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment with mid-single-digit growth in the DTC business, partially offset by pressures in wholesale and an unseasonably warm start to the fall season.', 'Revenues for Asia Pacific were up 1% on a constant currency and down 2% on a reported basis. Strong demand across the region drove low double-digit constant currency growth in the DTC business, which was largely offset by timing of wholesale shipments compared to last year. In North America, revenue for our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses combined grew 2% as we delivered another quarter of growth in both our retail stores and owned and operated e-commerce business with total DTC up low single digits. Our owned and operated e-commerce sales were up double digits for both brands again this quarter as the investments we have made in the platform and overall site experience continue to resonate with consumers. Wholesale sales for our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses combined in North America were also up low single digits.', ""Although retailers continue to take a cautious approach, retail sales trends improved sequentially compared to the second quarter, particularly at Macy's as we focus on driving sell-through and healthy inventory across the channel. Importantly, our quality of sales is improving significantly in North America as we grow that business. Gross margins were up over 500 basis points with increases across both brands and all channels. Looking at our overall third quarter revenue from a channel perspective, we continue to drive strong performance across all regions in our direct-to-consumer business. Our total DTC revenue was up 6% on a constant currency basis and up 8% on a reported basis in the quarter and up approximately 150 basis points as a percentage of our total revenue compared to last year."", 'We delivered another quarter of strong growth in both our stores and our owned and operated e-commerce business with constant currency revenues up 4% and 12%, respectively, compared to last year. Total wholesale revenue was down 3% on a constant currency basis for the reasons I previously outlined. On a reported basis, wholesale revenue was up 1%. Our Global Brands delivered another solid quarter with Calvin Klein revenues up 6% and Tommy Hilfiger revenues up 4% as reported. On a constant currency basis, revenue for Calvin Klein was up 3%, and Tommy Hilfiger was flat as macroeconomic challenges impacting Europe weigh more heavily on the Tommy business. Importantly, our DTC business was up in both brands and in all regions. In the third quarter, we delivered gross margin of 56.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year despite a 100-basis point negative impact to product costs due to exchange.', 'Gross margin reflects a significant favorable shift in mix with our higher gross margin DTC and international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue and a favorable impact from lower ocean freight rates compared to last year. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter was better than planned at 46.2% and flat versus the prior year. We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses while making targeted investments to drive the PVH+ Plan, including a nearly 20% increase in marketing compared to last year to fund cut through brand campaigns. These investments and the impact of the shift in mix to our DTC and international businesses were offset by an approximately 150 basis point improvement in expenses versus last year due to savings realized from the actions we have taken to reduce people costs and prudent management of expenses.', ""In total, EBIT for the quarter was $249 million, exceeding our expectations. Operating margin was 10.5% and expanded 90 basis points compared to last year despite the 100-basis point negative impact of exchange on our gross margin. And importantly, our operating margin for the quarter reflects a significant improvement in our North America business to 13.1% for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein combined. Earnings per share increased 12% to $2.90 compared to $2.60 in last year's third quarter and exceeded our guidance by $0.20, driven by the improvement in EBIT. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22%. And now moving on to our outlook. Starting with the fourth quarter. We are projecting fourth quarter revenue to decline 3% to 4% compared to last year on both a reported and constant currency basis with projected strong high single-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer businesses more than offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, including the revenue reduction from the sale of the Heritage Brands intimate apparel business."", 'Excluding the sale, the decline in wholesale revenue is mostly in Europe, where the wholesale revenues are projected to be down approximately 15% versus last year. Approximately two-thirds of that decrease is due to one-time shipment timing differences compared to last year when supply chains were still normalizing and about one-third is due to a decrease in sales to lower-margin accounts as we remain focused on quality of sales. Looking forward, as Stefan mentioned, we do expect the tough macros to continue into 2024. As a result, and combined with our continued focus on quality of sales, we now expect lower sell-in for wholesale next year with a higher quality sell-through. The benefit to the fourth quarter from the 53rd week in 2023 to our overall revenue is mostly offset by the revenue reduction from the sale of the Heritage Brands intimate apparel business.', ""While fourth quarter revenue is projected to be lower than last year, importantly, profitability is expected to be significantly higher. EBIT is expected to increase over 30% compared to last year, and operating margin is expected to expand to approximately 12%, up nearly 350 basis points compared to last year. And importantly, Europe profit has planned up significantly as well with regional margin up over 500 basis points versus last year and close to all-time highs. The overall increase in operating margin is almost entirely due to an approximately 400 basis point improvement in gross margin. The improvement is comprised of an approximately 150 basis point benefit due to a favorable shift in channel and regional mix, approximately 125 basis point improvement in freight expense, and approximately 125 basis point improvement due to the raw material costs for spring '24 product being significantly lower."", ""We expect all of these impacts to carry forward beyond the end of 2023. We also expect a modest increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to last year, with the higher expenses of DTC, mostly offset by the significant efficiencies we're driving in spending. Our fourth quarter earnings per share is projected to be approximately $3.45, up approximately 45% compared to $2.38 in the prior year, driven almost entirely by higher EBIT due to the significant profitability improvement. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter is estimated at approximately 22% and interest expense is projected to be approximately $25 million. And now bringing that all together for the full year 2023. As I mentioned, we are updating our full-year revenue outlook and now project revenue to increase by approximately 1% on both a reported and constant currency basis."", 'We are reaffirming our operating margin guidance for the year of approximately 10% and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 to approximately $10.45, up 16% compared to 2022 and a record high for PVH. Regionally, our full-year revenue outlook for North America for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein combined is unchanged. But our overall outlook for the region is now planned down mid-single digits compared to down low single digits previously, due entirely to the impact from the sale of the Heritage Brands intimate apparel business. Our outlook for Asia Pacific on a constant currency basis is also unchanged, planned up mid-teens. While on a reported basis, our revenue outlook for Asia Pacific has been negatively impacted by exchange, with growth on a reported basis now planned up high single digits compared to up low teens previously.', ""In Europe, we are now planning full-year revenue approximately flat in euros compared last year. This compares to our prior guidance of up-low single digits in euros. Our DTC business in Europe continued to be planned up mid-single digits but is mostly offset by a decrease in wholesale versus last year given the macroeconomic challenges I mentioned earlier. On a reported basis, Europe was planned up low single digits compared to up mid-single digits previously. We continue to expect our full-year gross margin rate to increase over 100 basis points compared to 2022, despite approximately 100 basis points of higher cost due to exchange. As we've indicated previously, the improvement in our gross margin reflects an approximately 100 basis point benefit from a favorable shift in mix and approximately 100 basis points of improvement due to lower freight costs."", ""We also continue to expect that SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year will increase approximately 70 basis points compared to 2022 with our investments in DTC and mix of international business driving higher expenses. Additionally, as I've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to invest in key areas that drive growth, including increased marketing with our full-year target continuing to be approximately 6% of revenue. These impacts are partially offset by cost efficiencies, primarily due to the people cost actions we have taken. As a reminder, in the third quarter, we completed our targeted 10% people cost reduction with annual savings ahead of our targeted $100 million of savings. Our full-year operating margin projection continues to be approximately 10% and continues to reflect high single-digit EBIT growth."", 'Interest expense is projected to be approximately $93 million versus approximately $100 million previously, and we continue to expect our tax rate will be approximately 22%. Before we open up for questions, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with our third quarter results. We continue to work relentlessly to drive results. And as Stefan talked about earlier, we are laser-focused on delivering our commitments by executing the 5 key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan, bringing together the consumer-facing value drivers of product, consumer engagement, and marketplace with our underlying operating engines to deliver consistent results in a systematic and repeatable way. And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions.', 'See also 12 European Countries with the Best Economy Right Now and Top 25 Natural Gas Producers in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", 'Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2023 Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$35.2b of debt, an increase on US$28.9b, over one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$6.15b, its net debt is less, at about US$29.1b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$14.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$37.4b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$6.15b as well as receivables valued at US$9.84b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$35.6b.', ""Since publicly traded Thermo Fisher Scientific shares are worth a very impressive total of US$190.5b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.', ""Thermo Fisher Scientific's net debt is 2.7 times its EBITDA, which is a significant but still reasonable amount of leverage. But its EBIT was about 13.9 times its interest expense, implying the company isn't really paying a high cost to maintain that level of debt. Even were the low cost to prove unsustainable, that is a good sign. Shareholders should be aware that Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT was down 20% last year. If that decline continues then paying off debt will be harder than selling foie gras at a vegan convention. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Thermo Fisher Scientific's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 73% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""Based on what we've seen Thermo Fisher Scientific is not finding it easy, given its EBIT growth rate, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. There's no doubt that its ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT is pretty flash. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about Thermo Fisher Scientific's debt levels. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that  Thermo Fisher Scientific is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about..."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

The company, he added, “has just been organically connecting with its community of more than one million people on X.”', 'Walmart did not immediately respond to a message for further comment on Friday afternoon.', 'The announcement comes two days after Musk went on an expletive-ridden rant in an on-stage interview with journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin about companies halting spending on X, formerly known as Twitter, in response to antisemitic and other hateful material. Musk said advertisers pulling out are engaging in “blackmail” and, using a profanity, essentially told them to go away.', '“Don’t advertise,” Musk said.', 'Besides Walmart, the Walt Disney Co., IBM, NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast have also decided to stop spending on X. Many pulled out earlier this month after the liberal advocacy group Media Matters issued a report showing their ads were appearing alongside material praising Nazis. X has sued the group, saying it “manufactured” the report in order to “drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp.”', ""X's CEO, Linda Yaccarino, is a former NBCUniversal executive who was hired by Musk to rebuild ties with advertisers who fled after he took over, concerned that his easing of content restrictions was allowing hateful and toxic speech to flourish and that would harm their brands.

You can't take the Adobe numbers out of context and project what's going on in retail. Those are only e-commerce numbers. And most of the numbers that have quoted are just totally consistent with the year-over-year growth that e-commerce has had all along because e-commerce is taking share."", ""We're not so sure what's happening in bricks-and-mortar retailing. But from what I've heard, a lot of what we saw in growth on the internet was at the expense of bricks and mortar. So be careful. It may not be that astounding a holiday season as people are streaming record numbers on Black Friday. All of that not so clear."", ""Given that environment, I still think, you know, the winners are those that provide tremendous value. Walmart has done great. I think they're performing as well as I've ever seen them perform. Their position in the area the consumer is focused on, which is closer in necessities, groceries, things like that, they're going to continue to do fantastic."", 'Costco continues to perform at very high level. TJX, very high level, excellent company, numbers that are fantastic. And then, of course, Amazon because that internet is growing and they are clearly the best on the internet.', ""Meanwhile, retailer after retailer, the other guys, they're reporting big negative numbers. Sometimes the stock has seen a surge. Like, you know, we've seen that recently with some companies that showed higher earnings than expected."", ""But look at the sales. Best Buy negative 7, Lowe's negative 7, Nordstrom's negative 7 same store sales, Macy's negative 7, Kohl's down 6, Target down 5, Home Depot down 4. There is a lot of carnage out there on the top line for sure in retailers right now because consumer is not open up their wallet and buying like crazy."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And Simeon, when you look at your coverage universe, get you in here too, who are some of the winners and losers in retail. Looking ahead, Simeon, break it down for us. Discounters, luxury, athletic gear, what do you see?', ""SIMEON SEIGEL: Josh Lipton, you bring me back in. I'm keeping notes on the things that I wanted to catch up on. One I wanted to point out that retail is all about storytelling, so back to the turnaround story. Let's keep in mind the marketing."", ""No, so-- listen, I think that Victoria's Secret reported today, they told us that November feels up. Like, they told us that Black Friday, the weekend, was good. And that obviously is a big store business."", ""So I think that what we do, everything I've been seeing-- so I generally agree with Jerry that a lot of these numbers we have to take with grains of salt or context. But the people that I'm talking to, what we are seeing, what we're hearing, I think so far the Black Friday weekend, the holiday has gotten off to a good start. I think the biggest question is going to be less did it perform now and more what's going to happen in the lull? We've got a long time between now and Christmas."", ""So I think that's going to be this interesting dynamic of did the strength that starts, does it carry through? And when we think about what Victoria's Secret said, they did guide January and December to see a material step down. So that'll be one thing worth watching."", ""But I'm going to-- I'm going to be a little bit more I think optimistic and flag that most of consumer just reported. And from what I'm looking at a little over 50% reported revenue growth and they all saw fantastic gross margin. So I think it is a little bit more of a case by case and, kind of, Jerry went through the winners."", ""And so I think when I look through this, I'm seeing a dichotomy, but it's not as much group agnostic. I'm seeing a lot of pairings. I'm seeing companies like Athleta see revenues down and we'll see Lulu up, right? You're seeing companies like Coach up and Michael Kors down. They sell the same thing."", ""And that works with the big box as well and so that works in off price as well. You're watching Nordstrom Rack and Old Navy who have revenues down and [INAUDIBLE] be up. So I think right now we're finally in this environment where winners, people who predict their demand well, are going to continue to win and those that don't are going to lose. That's an interesting retail opportunity. And so that actually makes me a little bit more optimistic.""]"

This is not about a specific change to our advertising policies. We’ve simply decreased spend over time to align with performance,” a Walmart spokesperson told CNN late Friday in an updated statement.', '“We’re constantly optimizing our marketing efforts. These decisions are made in a dynamic market and could change in the future.”', 'A number of prominent brands paused their advertising on X last month following Musk’s public embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory favored by White supremacists.', 'Following the news, Joe Benarroch, head of Operations at X, told CNN in a statement that brands who advertise on the platform are able to get in front of massive amount of users.', '“Walmart has a wonderful community on X, and with a half a billion people on X, every year the platform experiences 15 billion impressions about the holidays alone with more than 50 percent of X users doing most or all of their shopping online,” Benarroch said.', 'Benarroch claimed that Walmart’s decision to pull ads from X is not a direct result of Musk’s action and said Walmart continues to be active on the platform in other ways.', '“Walmart has not advertised on X since Oct[ober] so this is not a recent pause, the company has just been organically connecting with its community of more than one million people on X,” he said, pointing out Walmart’s continued posting to the platform including a post the company made on Friday after news broke of its advertising freeze.', 'Musk apologized Wednesday for what he called his “dumbest” ever social media post. But he lashed out at advertisers leaving his platform.', '“I don’t want them to advertise,” Musk said at the New York Times DealBook Summit in New York. “If someone is going to blackmail me with advertising or money go f**k yourself. Go. F**k. Yourself,” he said.', 'The advertising exodus included media companies like Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN.', 'Walmart’s decision didn’t come overnight, a person close to the matter said. The move was part of an escalating series of actions from the retailer, the person added, and the company will still keep running ads on other social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.', 'Craig Atkinson, chief executive officer of digital marketing agency Code3, told CNN it’s not surprising companies are pulling ads and he sees “no way to unring this bell.”', '“Big brands will say they don’t need X and will find their audiences elsewhere and they’re probably right,” he said. “As long as X has an engaged user base, opportunistic emerging brands will keep buying ads, but I don’t see a return of the big brands.”', 'Meanwhile, Jasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, said this is one more example of how Musk’s volatile leadership has impacted the company.', '“If anyone is killing X, it’s Elon Musk – not advertisers,” she said. “Should X collapse, an autopsy would reveal a series of platform policy decisions, staffing cuts, tweets, and antagonistic comments by Musk that have driven away X’s primary source of revenue.”', 'Enberg noted that before the latest incident, Insider Intelligence projected in October X’s global ad revenues to fall a remarkable 54.4% this year.', '“Personally and publicly attacking the advertisers that have kept X alive while the company is in the midst of an ad boycott could be the nail in the coffin for X’s ad business,” Enberg added.', '“It’s easier to pull advertising than it is to return, and what makes the X ad boycott unique is that it isn’t primarily about content adjacency or moderation,” she said. “Advertisers are concerned about the reputational damage and the uncertainty of doing business with Musk, and [his] comments will deepen the rift between them.”', 'Musk visited Israel this week, where he went to a Kibbutz attacked by Hamas on October 7, spoke with families of Israeli hostages and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog.', 'But Musk said on Wednesday that his trip to Israel “wasn’t an apology tour,” and that “it wasn’t in response to all of that.” Musk said that he is a good person but he’s not going to “tap dance” to show people that.', '– CNN’s Jennifer Korn contributed to this report', 'This story has been updated with additional information.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Prior to the recent hike, the company had announced a 24% increase in its quarterly dividend to 42 cents in December 2022.RJF raised its quarterly dividend five times in the last five years. Also, it has a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 16.6%. Currently, the company's payout ratio is 20% of earnings.Also, concurrently, Raymond James' board authorized the repurchase of its shares of common stock, aggregating to $1.5 billion, with no expiration date. The replaces the previous buyback program of $1.5 billion announced last December. Under the previous program, around $700 million remained as of Nov 30, 2023.Given a robust capital position and lower dividend payout ratio compared with its peers, the company is expected to sustain efficient capital distribution activities. Such moves are likely to drive shareholder confidence in the stock.RJF remains focused on inorganic growth moves, supported by its strong liquidity position, which has helped expand into Europe and Canada.

If the companies carry out their pledges, it could trim one-tenth of a degree Celsius (0.18 degrees Fahrenheit) from future warming, a prominent climate scientist calculated and told The Associated Press. That is about how much the Earth is currently warming every five years.', ""The announcement by Sultan al-Jaber, president of the climate summit known as COP28 and head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., comes as he and others have insisted his background would allow him to bring oil companies to the negotiating table. Al-Jaber has maintained that having the industry's buy-in is crucial to drastically slashing the world’s greenhouse emissions by nearly half in seven years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times."", ""Signing on to the pledge were major national oil companies such as Saudi Aramco, Brazil's Petrobras and Sonangol, from Angola, and multi-nationals like Shell, TotalEnergies and BP."", '“The world does not work without energy,” said al-Jaber, speaking in a session on the oil industry. “Yet the world will break down if we do not fix energies we use today, mitigate their emissions at a gigaton scale, and rapidly transition to zero carbon alternatives.”', ""As if anticipating critiques, al-Jaber added: “Is it enough? Hear me out, please. No, it's not enough. I say with full passion and conviction, I know that much more can be done.”"", 'For months leading up to COP28, there was speculation of action on methane. Not only do methane leaks, along with flaring, which is burning of excess methane, and venting of the gas, all contribute to climate change, but these problems can largely be solved with current technologies and changes to operations. Indeed, oil and gas companies could have taken such measures years ago but largely have not, instead focusing more on expanding production than focusing on the byproduct of it.', 'In that way, the methane deal represented a potentially significant contribution to combatting climate change that also largely maintained the status quo for the oil and gas industry. Many environmental groups were quick to criticize it.', 'The pledge is a “smokescreen to hide the reality that we need to phase out oil, gas and coal,” said a letter signed by more than 300 civil society groups.', 'Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said “the commitments to cut methane are significant, but they address the symptom, not the source.”', 'But Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp said Saturday’s deal “could be the single most impactful day of announcements from any COP in my 30 years at the Environmental Defense Fund.”', 'Methane has caused about half of the world’s warming since pre-industrial times, al-Jaber said, promoting the deal as significant. However, methane escaping from oil and gas drilling is only about 23% of the world’s methane emissions, with agriculture and waste being bigger culprits, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, the climate scientist who calculated the proposal would trim a tenth of a degree from future warming.', '“It would be a significant, but not a fundamental contribution"" to making sure average temperatures don\'t rise beyond 1.5 degrees, Hare said. To keep within that limit, the world needs to cut carbon dioxide about 40% and methane by about 60% by 2030, he said.', ""Methane can be released at several points along the operation of an oil and gas company, from fracking to when natural gas is produced, transported or stored. Over a shorter period, it’s 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. However, methane stays in the air only a couple decades — unlike thousands of years for carbon dioxide — so reducing methane faster is “low-hanging fruit” because it's easier and changes future warming more, al-Jaber said."", 'Marcelo Mena, CEO of Global Methane Hub, an alliance of philanthropies and organizations focused on reducing methane emissions, said that having near-zero methane emission commitments should not be seen as delaying a phase out of fossil fuels, as some environmental groups claimed.', '“We wouldn’t let oil companies leak into the ocean until phase out, so why would we let them leak out methane to super charge climate change?” said Mena, a former environment minister in Chile.', ""Still, Mena said that self-reporting didn't go far enough to push oil and gas companies to make changes. Instead, he said putting a price on pollution, or companies finding themselves shut out of markets that require high standards with leaks, would force change."", 'Stricter regulations are beginning to take hold. On Saturday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a final rule aimed at reducing methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants generated by the oil and gas industry. It targets emissions from existing oil and gas wells nationwide. Previous EPA regulations only focused on new wells. It also regulates smaller wells that will be required to find and plug methane leaks.', 'The United States will now have “the strongest methane regulations in the world,” White House climate adviser John Podesta told the AP.', 'Earlier this year, European Union negotiators reached a deal to reduce methane emissions from the energy industry across the 27-member bloc. The agreement bans routine venting and flaring, and mandates strict reporting. By 2027, it will expand those norms to oil and gas exporters outside the bloc.', ""Saturday's announcement did not address the oil and natural gas being burned off by the end users, so-called Scope 3 emissions, which can be motorists in their cars or plants powering cities. In his speech, al-Jaber said oil and gas companies needed to do more to research solutions to Scope 3 emissions."", 'The Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter is backed by both the United Arab Emirates and neighboring Saudi Arabia, two OPEC heavyweights.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's  ROE today."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:', '19% = US$5.4b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To start with, Occidental Petroleum's ROE looks acceptable. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 23%, we aren't very excited. Still, we can see that Occidental Petroleum has seen a remarkable net income growth of 27% over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this certainly also provides some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company."", ""As a next step, we compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 33% in the same period."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is OXY fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Occidental Petroleum has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 2.3%, meaning that it has the remaining 98% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Occidental Petroleum is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.', ""Besides, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 16% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Occidental Petroleum's performance.

But Pick’s ascent marked the culmination of a two-year slog that began when the bank named him co-president, alongside Andy Saperstein. To complicate matters, Morgan Stanley also named Dan Simkowitz co-head of strategy alongside Saperstein and appointed then-CFO Jon Pruzan as chief operating officer. Pruzan would leave in January 2023. But Morgan Stanley would retain Saperstein and Simkowitz even after Pick’s elevation, thanks in no small part to $20 million bonuses the bank promised all three.', 'It might be easy to conclude, upon reading Kelleher’s comments, that the UBS chair was engaging his “winter filter.” For those unfamiliar, this is a seemingly yearly ritual where, often in December and January, bank executives drop the standard veil of diplomacy and speak with unusual candor. (See, Jamie Dimon’s 2020 appeal to competing bankers to call him with tips on how JPMorgan Chase could boost its asset management profile.)', '“My line is open,” Dimon said at the time. “If you’ve got brilliant ideas, give me a call. And if you’re a competitor investment bank and you bring the idea, you get the fee.”', 'Like Dimon, Kelleher has cultivated a penchant for bluntness. He’s the sort of executive who, by at least one account, would lock the door at the start of a meeting to encourage latecomers to be more punctual next time.', 'Looking at Kelleher’s history, the desire to set up a “bloodless coup” at UBS could stem from any one of three roots:', '1. Kelleher may want UBS’s next CEO to get the chance he never got.', 'Let’s not get it twisted. In his previous stint at Morgan Stanley, Kelleher outlasted several executives seen to compete with him. But the battles weren’t a public, multiyear horse race. And, maybe, weren’t even battles.', 'Paul Taubman, a top dealmaker at Morgan Stanley who would go on to launch his own boutique operation, left the bank in 2012 after Kelleher was named sole head of sales and trading, a division they had run jointly.', 'When Kelleher was named Morgan Stanley’s president in 2016, Greg Fleming — another executive once seen as a potential future CEO candidate — left the bank. Morgan Stanley perhaps set the stage for Fleming’s departure when, months earlier, it narrowed his role to investment management. Fleming had once also overseen wealth management, too. Those responsibilities went to Kelleher — though Kelleher told the Financial Times in 2020 there was “no rivalry” between he and Fleming.', 'In retrospect, it seems the only Morgan Stanley executive Kelleher couldn’t outlast was Gorman.', 'Kelleher was named Morgan Stanley’s CFO in 2007 and helped keep the bank afloat through the financial crisis by aggressively running down the balance sheet, negotiating a $9 billion lifeline from Japan’s MUFG and tripling Morgan Stanley’s cash position.', '“I would have liked to have been CEO without a doubt,” Kelleher told the Financial Times in 2020.', 'Kelleher added that he “was lucky in the way I was promoted” but that Gorman was named CEO in 2009, and that the two were roughly same age.', 'Kelleher’s realization that “I wouldn’t be CEO” became reinforced when “James was doing an exceptional job,” he told the Financial Times.', 'In Kelleher’s last three years at Morgan Stanley, he and Gorman found an exceptional partnership wherein Gorman’s expertise in wealth management worked in tandem with Kelleher’s background in trading.', 'Kelleher ultimately left in 2019, when he “was absolutely convinced we were going to have another recession,” he told the Financial Times. “I did not want to be in Morgan Stanley in a position of seniority with another recession, not because I couldn’t have done it but because … I wanted to leave with my career at a high, my flags flying, my arms kept [up] as I marched out of the fortress.”', 'With all of this said, it is unlikely that Kelleher wants to adapt a 2021 Morgan Stanley succession sweepstakes to UBS for the spectacle of it.', '“I never confused the job with the status of who I am,” Kelleher told the Financial Times.', '2. Kelleher may see a lot of himself in Ermotti.', 'Kelleher became UBS’s chair at age 64. Ermotti, the former UBS CEO whom the bank brought back in April to helm its integration with Credit Suisse, is 63.', '“Sergio has a lot of life in him but he’s not as young as some people,” Kelleher said Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.', 'Kelleher may also be thinking of his own mindframe, circa 2019, with regard to recession. Banking sector observers may be pinning the odds of a recession in 2024 as less likely than previously thought. But, he noted, 2024 won’t be as easy — so to speak — as this year at UBS.', '“The easy losses are getting rid of headcount, the sticky ones are allocated in control functions, data, IT,” Kelleher told the Financial Times. “2024 is the first year we don’t have the cover of the ‘easy’ costs.”', 'The idea of a succession runoff at UBS isn’t new, Kelleher told the publication.', '“I discussed it at dinner with Sergio when he agreed to come back,” he said.', 'Ideally, Kelleher said, the shortlist of potential successors to Ermotti would contain three names. Kelleher told Bloomberg he’d prefer to promote people from within “because that is a validation of a culture.” But, he told the Financial Times, he’d also consider external hires to bolster competition.', 'Ermotti told Bilanz an internal successor would be ideal.', '""When the bank is successful, it is better to have someone who knows the internal mechanisms,” Ermotti said.', '3. Kelleher may like the idea because he still has a fondness for Morgan Stanley.', 'Kelleher’s preference for internal promotion may stem from his penchant for loyalty. Anecdotally, The Wall Street Journal reported, during Kelleher’s time at Morgan Stanley, he referred to rival JPMorgan Chase simply as “Chase,” implying only one bank was worthy of the “Morgan” name.', 'Later in his tenure at the bank, Kelleher would turn down offers to become CEO at Barclays and Lloyds, according to The Journal.', 'Kelleher told the Financial Times in 2020 that he only considered leaving Morgan Stanley once — in 2001, potentially to follow the bank’s then-CEO to Credit Suisse.', 'But “at the end of the day, if you move jobs you become a bit of a professional gunslinger,” Kelleher said.', 'This story was originally published on Banking Dive.

This transaction has caught the attention of investors and market analysts, as insider activity, particularly sales, can provide valuable insights into a company's financial health and future prospects."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CRM.', ""Amy Weaver has been a key figure at Salesforce Inc, serving as the company's President and CFO. Her role involves overseeing the global finance organization, leading the company's financial operations, including accounting, tax, treasury, and investor relations. Weaver's extensive experience in the financial sector and her position within Salesforce give her a unique perspective on the company's performance and strategic direction. Her recent decision to sell shares has thus prompted a closer examination of the potential implications for Salesforce and its stakeholders."", ""Salesforce Inc is a leading provider of customer relationship management (NYSE:CRM) software and enterprise cloud computing solutions. The company's services enable businesses to connect with their customers in new ways through a suite of applications focused on sales, customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and application development. Salesforce's innovative platform is designed to help businesses grow and manage their operations more effectively, leveraging the power of cloud, social, mobile, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies."", ""Insider transactions, particularly sales, can be a double-edged sword when it comes to stock price implications. On one hand, insiders may sell shares for various personal reasons that do not necessarily reflect their outlook on the company's future, such as diversifying their investment portfolio or financing personal expenditures. On the other hand, a sale by a high-ranking executive like Amy Weaver can sometimes be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the company's future growth or valuation."", 'Looking at the broader picture of insider activity at Salesforce Inc, there have been no insider buys over the past year, while there have been 294 insider sells in the same timeframe. This trend could suggest that insiders, on balance, see the current stock price as an opportune time to realize gains on their investments.', ""On the day of Weaver's recent sale, Salesforce Inc shares were trading at $250, giving the company a substantial market cap of $251.68 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 98.86 is higher than the industry median of 26.85, indicating that Salesforce's shares are trading at a premium compared to its industry peers. However, it is lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio, which could imply that the stock is not as overvalued as it has been in the past."", ""When considering the GuruFocus Value, Salesforce Inc's stock appears to be Fairly Valued with a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.05. This assessment is based on historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor for past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from analysts."", ""The GF Value is a proprietary metric developed by GuruFocus to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock. Salesforce's GF Value of $238.23, when compared to its trading price of $250, suggests that the stock is trading at a level consistent with its estimated fair value."", ""The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the selling pattern among Salesforce insiders. The concentration of sales over purchases could be a signal to investors that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company's workings are choosing to cash in on their holdings rather than invest more at current prices."", ""The GF Value image further illustrates the relationship between Salesforce's stock price and its intrinsic value. While the stock is currently deemed Fairly Valued, any significant divergence from this ratio in the future could indicate a potential overvaluation or undervaluation, providing investors with a potential signal for investment decisions."", ""Amy Weaver's sale of 94,980 shares of Salesforce Inc is a notable event that warrants attention from the investment community. While the insider's actions may not necessarily predict future stock movement, they do contribute to the broader narrative of insider sentiment at the company. With Salesforce's stock currently trading around its estimated fair value and the company maintaining a strong market cap, investors should continue to monitor insider trends and valuation metrics to inform their investment strategies."", ""As always, it is important for investors to consider the context of insider transactions and to use them as one of many tools in their investment decision-making process. Salesforce Inc's position as a leader in the CRM and enterprise cloud computing space, combined with its current valuation, presents a complex picture that requires careful analysis beyond insider activity alone."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Number two, we have a great new product."", ""And everyone knows here at Dreamforce, Data Cloud. You can see in the quarter 1,000 new Data Cloud customers. That is number two thing. I am really excited about that. I literally just got off the plane from Tokyo. You probably all saw me yesterday at Salesforce World Tour. Tokyo was incredible. Everyone is very excited about Salesforce in Japan, now the second largest software company in Japan. Incredible what has happened over there in the market. I met with hundreds of customers while I was there. I spoke to some of the CEOs of the largest companies in Japan. It was an incredible week.

And the third thing is, these Einstein GPT Copilots that we've delivered. These Einstein GPT Copilots, this is a product we didn't really even have an imagination around a year ago. Of course, we had Einstein. Of course, we could see the incredible growth of Einstein. I mean now, Einstein with predictive and generative combined, is doing 1 trillion transactions a week, that's amazing. But more amazing is that 17% of the Fortune 100 are now Einstein GPT Copilot customers. And this is a product that is just coming to market. Everyone is so excited about buying this product. So when you see these larger deals, when you see Data Cloud, when you see these Einstein GPT Copilots going into place, that is why we are excited about our growth and why we're excited about this quarter."", ""And then you look at the financial metrics. The $1.5 billion in cash flow, up about 1,000%. That is another reason why we're excited about the quarter. So let me get into the script a little bit, and let me talk to kind of give you the structured messages and then turn this over to Brian. So number one, we are the number one AI CRM. If that isn't clear already, we're leading the industry through the unprecedented AI innovation cycle. It's unlike anything I've seen and most of the people that I talk to all over the world feel the same way. We're the only platform that are bringing CRM and data and AI and trust together for our customers in a way that enables them across every industry to be more successful, faster, be more productive, more efficient."", ""We're the number one by market share for the tenth year in a row based on latest IDC software tracker. We're the number one enterprise apps company now. That's amazing. And Data Cloud, this hyperscale, this real-time customer data platform that is performing incredibly well for us, it's the foundation of every AI transaction, but it's the foundation of every large deal that we did this quarter. That is what is so exciting. And in just our third quarter, Data Cloud has ingested an astonishing 6.4 trillion records, 6.4 trillion records. That's 140% year-over-year increase. It triggered 1.4 trillion activations, a 220% increase year-over-year. This is a monster product. I could not be more excited. And it's the perfect time, we didn't really understand that it was going to line up so well with this generative AI revolution."", ""It's a product we've been working on for a couple of years. Just the timing of it has been incredible because listen, if you don't have your data together, in a company, you're not going to deliver AI. It's not like companies are going to run their AI off of Reddit or off of some kind of big public data set. They have to have their data set together to make AI work for them, and that is why the Data Cloud is so powerful for them. Now as I've said before, this AI revolution is going to be a trust revolution. It's not just about CRM, data or AI. It's also about trust. And I think the trust layer and the way that we've architected our platform so that our customers are not basically taking -- getting taken advantage of these next-generation large language models, these foundation models, they are so hungry for all of this data, and they want our customers' data so that they can grow."", ""We're not going to let them have it. We're going to separate ourselves from those models through a trust layer so customers can be protected. This is going to be so important for the future of how Salesforce architects itself with artificial intelligence. Now revenue in the quarter was $8.7 billion. Not too many software executives get to say it so I think I'll say it twice, actually. Revenue for the quarter was $8.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year, incredible. Third largest enterprise software company now by revenue, also incredible. And companies standardizing on Salesforce as their core technology platform, doing these multi-cloud deals with us. Getting that growth, as I said, that incredible stat that Brian is going to come back to, the 80% growth in deals of more than $1 million, so exciting."", ""Nine of the top 10 deals included six or more clouds. Think about that. Nine out of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds. So that we have amazing clouds, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Platform, our Commerce Cloud, Slack, Tableau, MuleSoft, but think about it, how they're bringing all of those things together, Data Cloud, they're bringing it all together into a cocktail. That's amazing. And by the way, those cocktails are going to be a Christmas cocktail soon. And in Q3, we once again showed our commitment to increasing our margins. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 31.2%, up 850 basis points year-over-year, following an increase of 1,000 basis points in the previous two quarters. It kind of is a sentence that you don't really expect ever read as a CEO, so that was kind of amazing."", ""Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $1.5 billion, up 389% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 1,088% year-over-year. Percentages and absolute numbers are just mind blowing. And our remaining performance obligation ended the third quarter at $48.3 billion, which is an increase of, yes, 21% year-over-year. Pretty good. Okay. Now let's move on to guidance. Based on our performance, we're raising our fiscal year '24 revenue guidance in constant currency to 34.8% at the high end of the range, 11% projected growth year-over-year. Last quarter was raised our fiscal year '24 non-GAAP operating margin of 30% and now we're accelerating again. And we think that we're going to move this thing to 30.5% for the year. And Amy, I think you better beat that, okay?"", ""So I mean, the acceleration on the margin this year has been pretty incredible as we all know. So if you go back and look at the last five quarters, you wouldn't believe it. I don't believe it. We delivered an improvement of 850 basis points year-over-year this quarter. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team, how well they are doing. We just got our employee surveys back. The team, the morale is super high, so cohesive, brought back so many boomerangs, really reinforced our culture during this year as well. That's been one of the major things that we have been doing. We've really been focused on building this number one AI CRM, rebuilding our product strategy. Really focused on, number two, is getting these sales executives be able to tell these stories of AI success."", ""And it's incredible to be able to exactly explain to a customer what they can do to be successful. Through the third thing we're really focused on is this idea of delivering new products and new technologies, and this UE+ product that we've now introduced in the market to see so many customers adopt that in the quarter, to see so much of it in our pipeline, UE+ and the incredible work of David Schmaier and his team has been just amazing there. And also our professional services team, delivering these great implementations and making sure our customers are successful. And the fifth thing I would say we're focused on is this Ohana 2.0 culture, which is really takes shape in the middle of this year and really now evidence in this -- you probably saw we just became a Great Place to Work again."", ""We're on the top 10. We're now number seven. And it's amazing to see that recognition for this company is so well deserved. So where are we? Well, you're seeing this high level of interest in Data Cloud and Einstein. It's incredible what's happened. I've been on the road pretty much nonstop especially over the last month. I've been in -- throughout Europe. I've been now in Asia. I've been throughout the United States. And I just continue to see these same trends, which is customers are investing for the future and they're investing and inspired by AI to give them more productivity. Look, they realize unemployment is just so low. Where are they going to hire more people? It's so hard for them to hire, they're going to have to get more productivity from their employees."", ""They're going to do that through this great new technology, and we're going to help them make that happen. Data Cloud was part of six of our top 10 deals in the quarter. We had more than 1,000 net new customers for Data Cloud. I've talked a little bit about the number of deals, the number of wins over $1 million in Data Cloud doubled, and the average ARR per win more than tripled compared to last quarter, pretty awesome. And we've now traded a self-service switch so that every EE and UE customer can just flip it on. And engineering has just done a great job getting every customer become a Data Cloud customer. Closed a lot of amazing deals in the quarter. Really excited about AWS. I know everyone has been talking about that, especially down at the conference this week at ReInvent and we couldn't be more thrilled for our partnership with Andy Jassy, really excited."", ""Really excited about our relationship with American Cancer Society. They've been a customer for a long time. Doing incredible work now seeing them use the Data Cloud, even becoming even more productive, more efficient. Group Global, 30 million users now using Data Cloud, SiriusXM. Joe Inzerillo, great executive. We worked so closely with him at Disney. And one of the reasons that Disney has become wall-to-wall Salesforce. And nowadays at SiriusXM, he's deployed a great, incredible deployment of Data Cloud, but our -- actually our whole product line or so. Excited to work with Joe. And this is really, I think, going to continue on as we start to talk more about customers who are using Data Cloud. I was just in Houston and had a great dinner down there with all of our customers."", ""We had some phenomenal local country music performance at the dinner as well. The Ortega family did a great job cooking for us. Their restaurants are probably our favorite when we get on the road. But I'll tell you, Waste Management and Jim Fish, who I saw when I was in Houston, great executive, love working with Jim. Here is a great company, North America's leading environmental sustaining solutions provider. Now most of the folks on the call are probably customers. And wow, they just have done an incredible implementation and now doing a great job implementing all the AI solutions as well. Well, there's a lot more to talk about there. We've got so much going on and March 8 is going to be a big day for Salesforce. We're going to turn 25 years old."", ""It's hard to believe. At the same time, we've completely rebuilt the company and so well positioned for the AI revolution. And we're lucky to have a great management team, and we've got them sitting here at the table. Of course, we've got Mike Spencer here who is doing a great job running FP&A and IR. We have Sabastian, our new Chief Legal Officer; Amy, our new CFO. But Brian, why don't you take it from here and tell us what happened during the quarter?"", ""Brian Millham: Yeah, I really appreciate it, Marc. Thank you so much. I'm very pleased with the quarter, and it's really a testament to our laser focus on operational excellence, high performance and profitable growth initiatives. We're seeing the results of our full-scale transformation of our company. In Q3, our non-GAAP operating margin is up an amazing 850 basis points year-over-year. And we reduced GAAP sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue by 6 full points. And we've matured our pricing and packaging to drive growth and simplify the buying experience. As Marc said, we're well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth as we head into the largest quarter, our largest quarter and into next fiscal year."", 'Despite the continued measured buying environment, we grew revenues in Q3, driven primarily by the strength of our product portfolio and multi-cloud transformational deals. In fact, the average size of our deals greater than $1 million, as Marc said, was up 80% year-over-year, doubling our net new business in this segment. And for the third consecutive quarter, we saw add-on products like sales performance management, digital service and sales productivity grow ARR nearly 40%. As customers look for quick time-to-value solutions and productivity gains, we saw traction with our new Salesforce Starter offering with nearly 1,000 new logos added this quarter. As the number one AI CRM, companies in every industry and geography like Fujitsu, Southwest Airlines, NZ Bank are turning to us as their trusted adviser to help them transform their business for the AI future.', ""We're seeing amazing energy across our ecosystem with our partners, GSIs and ISVs who are looking to do -- build more opportunities with us around our AI offerings. And we've established new partnerships with global management consulting companies like Bain & McKinsey. And as Marc mentioned, we're expanding our existing relationship with AWS. It marks a significant milestone in the evolution of our global partnership with Amazon, deepening the integrations between AWS and Salesforce products. We're bringing together the number one AI CRM and a leading public cloud provider to deliver an open integrated data and AI platform to make it easy to find, buy and manage Salesforce products to the AWS Marketplace. Before I get into the product momentum, I want to share some operational highlights."", ""We continue to effectively manage our expenses, as you've seen, and is reflected in our improved non-GAAP operating margin, which exceeded 31%. Today, our execution, inspection and understanding of our customers buying and approval process is better than ever. Our focus on high performance is a driver of growth is paying huge dividends in Q3. We saw more than a 30% increase in AE productivity year-over-year. We're also refining and scaling our big deal motion and further bundling products to drive higher sales and simplify the buying experience for our customers. And we're doing all this while becoming more effective and efficient. I've been impressed with how quickly we deployed our own trusted generative AI tools and applications internally."", ""We've launched Sales, GPT and Slack Sales, Elevate internally, and our global support team is live with Service GPT, and we're seeing incredible results. We've streamlined our quoting process with automation, eliminating over 200,000 manual approvals so far this year. And since the introduction in September, our AI-driven chatbot has autonomously resolved thousands of employee-related queries without the need for human involvement. We're seeing great success with our products and so our customers, which is clearly reflected in the high-level engagement and participation we're seeing in our events. In addition to Dreamforce, we hosted 80% of our top customers for the quarter. We also held an amazing 450 customer events in our offices with nearly $2 billion in pipeline."", ""And as we close out the year, we have a New York City world tour coming up in December 14. I hope you all can join us in person. And if you can't, we hope you join us on Salesforce+. We continue to hire selectively across key growth areas, especially in data cloud and AI, and we've seen the highest demand to join Salesforce in our history with the largest volume of applications in any quarter ever. Our growth initiatives across our core products, data, AI, industries and international drove our strong performance in the quarter. And as Marc outlined, we're seeing strong momentum in Data Cloud and Einstein. Importantly, we're already seeing high demand for our new premium UE+ bundle as customers recognize the value of our integrated solutions with Einstein AI functionality and Data Cloud built in."", ""And our existing customers increased their spend with us by more than 70% when they upgraded to UE+. Industry clouds continue to be a tailwind to our growth, chosen by customers like Humana and U.S. Agency for internal development and RBC Wealth Management U.S. For the first time this quarter, nine of 13 Industry Clouds grew ARR above 50%. We're seeing continued MuleSoft growth, which was in eight of our top 10 deals this quarter and delivered an amazing 140 billion automated flows, up 142% year-over-year. And Tableau, which is fully integrated to the Data Cloud, continues to help customers like Rubrik, Canara Bank and U.S. Navy see and understand their data and make data-driven decisions. In the quarter, we did continue to see the macro trends affect our business, in particular, our professional services business, our create and close sales motion and our Slack self-service business."", ""Despite those headwinds, Slack was included in seven of our top 10 deals. Every day this quarter, there were 700 million Slack messages sent and 2.75 million workflows ran on the Slack platform. We recently announced Denise Dresser as the new CEO of Slack, and I've had the chance to work with Denise for a dozen years and could not be more thrilled for her, and importantly, for the Slack business. Before I hand it off to Amy, I want to share some key number and highlights on how we deliver for our customers during Cyber Week. Commerce Cloud powered nearly 50 million orders on digital storefronts across Cyber Week with 100% uptime. Einstein powered more than 49 billion product recommendations, and over 53 billion marketing messages were sent via the Marketing Cloud."", ""In addition, Service Cloud helped our customers field and resolve 3.7 billion cases. This clearly demonstrates the scale and reliability of our number one AI CRM platform. So in closing, we're heading into Q4 with a ton of energy and ambition, guiding our customers through a new innovation cycle with an unwavering commitment to their success. I, like Marc, am extremely proud of the team with the changes that we've made not just in Q3 but over the last year. And as I said earlier, we're well positioned for Q4 and as we head into fiscal year '25. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Amy."", ""Amy Weaver: Great. Thanks, Brian. Q3 represents another strong quarter of strong execution and discipline. As you heard from both Marc and Brian, we've transformed the company over the past 12 months to drive consistent, profitable growth. And we are pioneering the next wave of innovation with data, AI, CRM and trust. Now let's get right to the results. For the third quarter, revenue was $8.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 10% in constant currency. This represents a $40 million beat in constant currency. The growth was primarily driven by continued MuleSoft momentum and resilient sales and service performance. From a geographic perspective, the Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA grew 14% or 10% in constant currency, and APAC grew 18% or 21% in constant currency."", 'We saw strong new business growth in India, Brazil and Japan, while parts of EMEA were more constrained. From an industry perspective, public sector performed very well while high tech and general continues to be more measured. And as Brian mentioned, our multi-cloud momentum continues. In Q3, nine of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds. Q3 revenue attrition remained strong and ended the quarter again at approximately 8%. In Q3, our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.2%, up 850 basis points year-over-year. Our strong margin outperformance was driven by our continued disciplined investment strategy. Q3 operating cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 389% year-over-year. Q3 free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 1,088% year-over-year. This upside in cash flow was driven primarily by strong collections as well as lower cash outflow that results to higher margins just discussed.', 'Now turning to remaining performance obligations, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q3 at $48.3 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency. This was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by strong early renewal performance as well as a large customer win in the quarter. This was partially offset by a 1 point headwind from professional services that we had cautioned about last quarter. Finally, we continue to deliver on our capital return commitment. In Q3, we returned another $1.9 billion in the form of share repurchases. And to date, we have exceeded our initial authorization of $10 billion in just over five quarters.', ""Before moving to guidance, I want to reiterate that we continue to assume a consistent measured customer buying environment. Let's start with full year fiscal year '24. On revenue, we are narrowing our guidance range to $34.75 billion to $34.8 billion, representing 11% growth year-over-year in nominal. We are now expecting a $50 million FX headwind, which implies a modest raise in constant currency. On margins, we have made incredible progress on profitability and productivity this year. For fiscal year '24, we are very pleased to raise non-GAAP operating margin guidance again to 30.5%, representing an 800 basis point improvement year-over-year. We also remain focused on stock-based compensation, which is now expected to be approximately 8% as a percent of revenue."", ""As a result of these updates, we now expect fiscal year '24 GAAP diluted EPS of $3.99 to $4, including estimated charges for the restructuring of $0.91. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be $8.18 to $8.19. We are raising our fiscal year '24 operating cash flow growth guidance to approximately 30% to 33%, and this continues to include a 14- to 16-point headwind from restructuring. The upside in our cash flow guidance is driven by strong collections to date and our continued expense discipline. CapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 33% to 36% for the fiscal year. And as we focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, we continue to expect to fully offset our stock-based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year '24."", ""In fact, as a result of our ongoing share repurchases, for the first time in company history, we expect the full year's ending share count to decrease year-over-year. Now to guidance for Q4. On revenue, we expect $9.18 billion to $9.23 billion, growth of 10% in both nominal and constant currency. CRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be 10% year-over-year in nominal and 11% in constant currency. Similar to this past quarter, we expect professional services headwinds of 1 point to CRPO growth. For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.27 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.26. As we look forward to our largest quarter of the year, we remain focused on strong execution and our disciplined investment strategy. In closing, I want to echo both Marc and Brian."", ""This was a great quarter, but even more than that, this has been an extraordinary year of transformation. I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and I particularly want to thank our employees for their incredible work throughout the past year. Now Mike, let's open up the call for questions."", ""Michael Spencer: Thanks, Amy. Operator, we'll move to questions now. Out of courtesy for others on the call, we ask that each person participating only ask one question. And with that, operator, we'll take the first question."", 'See also 21 Countries with Most Spanish Speakers Heading into 2024 and 25 Best Cities Where You Can Retire On $5000 A Month.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

On November 30, 2023, Robert Fauber sold 2,546 shares of the company, a transaction that has caught the attention of investors and market analysts alike."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with MCO.', ""Robert Fauber is the President and CEO of Moody's Corporation, a position he has held since January 2021. Fauber has been with Moody's since 2009, serving in various leadership roles, including Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service and Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. His extensive experience in the financial services industry and his leadership at Moody's have been integral to the company's strategic initiatives and global expansion."", ""Moody's Corporation is a global integrated risk assessment firm that provides credit ratings, research, tools, and analysis for investors and other market participants. The company's core divisions include Moody's Investors Service, which offers credit ratings and research covering debt instruments and securities, and Moody's Analytics, which provides software, advisory services, and research for financial analysis and risk management. Moody's plays a critical role in global capital markets by providing transparent and independent assessments that help investors make informed decisions."", ""Insider transactions are often scrutinized by investors as they can provide insights into a company's internal perspective on its stock's valuation. Over the past year, Robert Fauber has sold a total of 27,821 shares and has not made any purchases. This pattern of selling without corresponding buys could signal that insiders, including the CEO, believe the stock may be fully valued or overvalued at current prices."", ""When examining the insider transaction history for Moody's Corporation, it is notable that there have been no insider buys over the past year, while there have been 21 insider sells during the same period. This trend suggests a lack of buying interest from insiders, which could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's potential for near-term appreciation."", ""On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Moody's Corporation were trading at $360.43, giving the company a market cap of $67.904 billion. This price level reflects a price-earnings ratio of 45.14, which is significantly higher than the industry median of 18.13 and above the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. Such a high price-earnings ratio could indicate that the stock is overvalued relative to its earnings potential."", ""Furthermore, with a price of $360.43 and a GuruFocus Value of $329.20, Moody's Corporation has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.09. This suggests that the stock is modestly overvalued based on its GF Value."", ""The GF Value is a proprietary intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus. It is calculated considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from Morningstar analysts. When the price-to-GF-Value ratio is above 1, it indicates that the stock may be overvalued compared to its intrinsic value."", ""Given the current valuation metrics and the insider selling trend, investors may want to exercise caution with Moody's Corporation stock. While the company holds a strong position in the risk assessment industry, the high price-earnings ratio and the modest overvaluation based on the GF Value could limit the stock's upside potential in the near term. Additionally, the lack of insider buying could be a sign that those with the most knowledge of the company's prospects are not compelled to increase their stakes at current prices."", ""It is important for investors to consider these insider trading patterns and valuation metrics as part of a broader investment analysis. While insider selling alone does not necessarily predict a decline in stock price, it can provide context for understanding how insiders view the stock's valuation and future prospects."", ""In conclusion, the recent insider sell by Moody's Corporation's President and CEO, Robert Fauber, along with the absence of insider buying, may suggest a cautious outlook on the stock's current valuation. Investors should weigh these factors alongside other fundamental and technical analyses to make informed investment decisions regarding Moody's Corporation shares."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Total U.S. output, which came ahead of our projection of 352 BOE/d, comprised approximately 51% oil, or 189,000 barrels per day (bpd).Significantly higher year-over-year production from Eagle Ford favored the company’s quarterly performance, which was partly offset by lower volumes from the Oklahoma area. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 158,000 BOE/d, surging 75.6% from the third-quarter 2022 level, while output from Bakken was 121,000 BOE/d compared with 118,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter.

Supply-chain costs included inflation across procurement and manufacturing costs.', 'North America: Net sales of $4,995 million declined 0.4% year over year. Organic sales fell 0.1%.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results are subject to many risks and uncertainties.

In Q4, we exceeded the high end of all our guidance targets and delivered another quarterly revenue high at $1.599 billion. Q4 thus capped a record year, growing revenue by 15% to $5.84 billion, with strong orders expanding backlog by $1.5 billion to $8.6 billion. We further improved non-GAAP operating margin to 35.1%, increased non-GAAP EPS by 26%, generated $1.7 billion in operating cash flow while maintaining an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Clearly, Synopsys has moved forward with sustained momentum. Over the last five years, we've grown revenue at 13% CAGR, expanded non-GAAP operating margin by 13 points, and increased non-GAAP EPS at a 23% CAGR. Through the year, we also widened our differentiation by substantially expanding our AI-driven product capabilities, but also through unique collaborations that strengthened our customers' differentiation while cementing deep long-term relationships."", 'We thank our employees for their passion and dedication, and our customers for their business and trust in Synopsys. Meanwhile, dark geopolitical clouds are inflicting unimaginable harm in multiple conflict zones. Our hearts hurt with deep compassion for our employees, families, colleagues, customers, and all others impacted by pain, loss, and uncertainty. Yet, we will never give up believing in the positive potential of humanity. It is thus heartwarming to see how fast our teams have turned compassion into caring, caring into action, and how respect and support for each other is an active norm at Synopsys. Let me now briefly share some thoughts on the state of the industry and our company before I pass the baton to Sassine. From the first days of Synopsys 37 years ago, Synopsys has enabled and navigated the exponential ambition that came to be defining the semiconductor industry and which in turn radically impacted the world.', ""Our initial contribution, synthesis, revolutionized digital design. We ushered in the transition from CAD, Computer Aided Design, to EDA, Electronic Design Automation, so far delivering roughly a 10 million X increase in design productivity. During Synopsys' entire existence, the vast majority of our products have been the state-of-the-art. Together with the leading foundries, we thus empowered digital age exponential, referred to as Moore's Law. And then at the very moment that the economics of classic Moore's Law are slowing down in terms of transistor performance and cost improvements, the era of big data and AI becomes real, triggering enormous compute needs on the horizon. About eight years ago, Synopsys forecasted this age of smart everything would become the driver for the semiconductor growth to a trillion dollars in this decade."", ""And here we are. This year's Generative AI advances and furious adoption clearly fulfill our vision. As Pervasive AI is now massively underway, the classic Moore's Law era in turn is morphing into the SysMoore era, systemic complexity but still with a Moore's Law exponential ambition. SysMoore is happening in front of our eyes by reinventing architectures not based on a single chip, but on multiple chips, tightly connected, or even stacked on top of each other with extreme proximity. These so-called software-defined multi-die architectures will enable massive increases in the number of transistors available. And again, Synopsys is at the heart of the heart of catalyzing exponential impact. Our investments in multi-die design, our massive collection of IP building blocks in many silicon technology, our prototyping and electronic digital twinning technology that lets customers run software before the hardware actually exists, are all essential enablers driving the new race into AI driven computation."", ""Adding one more spark to our technical leadership, Synopsys also pioneered the use of DeepLearning.AI in chip design. Applied to optimization, verification, and test, production results are outstanding, and adoption is broad and rapid. Most recently, our announcement of exciting GenAI capabilities adds yet another angle to driving the state-of-the-art forward. If nothing else, my enthusiasm for both the CISMO opportunity and for our technology advances should give you a sense how Synopsys is on the move. Talking about on the move, we're also well on the way in our executive leadership transition. I have great confidence, expectations, and enthusiasm for Sassine Ghazi as our next CEO. Sassine, please give us your perspective, vision and ambition for Synopsys."", 'The floor is all yours.', ""Sassine Ghazi: Thank you, Aart, for your pioneering work in our industry and for building Synopsys into one of the world's essential semiconductor ecosystem companies. I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to succeed you as CEO, building on our strong foundation and propelling Synopsys to the next wave of growth. Let's turn to market trends. Despite global macroeconomic uncertainty, our customers continue to prioritize R&D investments and chip design starts remain robust. We leave 2023 with $8.6 billion in non-cancellable backlog, and have a time-tested business model that balances dynamic growth with macro resiliency. We expect solid growth across our geographies in 2024. But our outlook reflects a continued challenging near-term growth environment in China."", 'China is an adaptable and large market. However, given the combination of Entity List and technology restrictions and a weaker macroeconomic outlook, we believe more pragmatism in our 2024 China forecast is appropriate. Technology trends continue to create a rising tide for our business. Chief among those trends is a new era of AI driven productivity. AI is reshaping industries and providing breakthrough solutions for intractable challenges, like the 15% to 30% percent design resource shortage the semiconductor is facing this decade. We pioneered AI driven semiconductor design and are relentlessly advancing our AI capabilities so that we can drive step-up function improvement in our customers’ productivity and thus play a greater role in their success.', ""Recently, at Microsoft's Ignite conference, we announced a breakthrough Generative AI capability for accelerating chip design, Synopsys.ai Copilot. The new capability is the result of a strategic collaboration with Microsoft to integrate Azure service that brings the power of GenAI into one of the most complex engineering challenges, the design process for semiconductors. The integration of GenAI across Synopsys.ai provides chip designers with collaborative capabilities that offer expert tool guidance, generative capabilities to enable RTL and collateral creation, and fully autonomous capabilities for workflow creation from natural language. We're engaged with leading chip makers, including AMD, Intel, and Microsoft, to deliver the value of GenAI across the Synopsys.ai full EDA stack from design, verification, test to manufacturing."", ""We are at a very early stage of this new AI era, but our initial customer results are exceptional. AI is key to massively unlocking customer productivity, and we are increasing our investment to accelerate the Synopsys.ai roadmap. Beyond AI, we see multiple other secular tailwinds providing our design automation and Design IP business expanding growth opportunities. With the slowing of Moore's Law, increasingly, architecture and design automation are the main levers in delivering semiconductor PPA gains, even as insatiable use case demands push the frontiers of performance and performance per watt. Multi-die implementations are accelerating as our customers seek to optimize cost and yield for these large complex designs. And our customers who rely on our critical competencies from silicon to software, now require a systems level approach, both at the semiconductor device level with multi-die and in the electronic design, software bring-up, and software validation of full systems, like today's software defined cars."", 'Our Design IP business also has strong wind in its sails. Applications crave ever faster ingest and throughput, resulting in faster protocol migrations and increasing IP content value per device. Customers are prioritizing scarce design resources to focus on their critical architectural differentiation and turning to us as an integral part of their chip design development teams for their foundation and interface IP needs. And now, all three leading edge foundries are making Synopsys the advanced node IP vendor of choice. They are partnering with us on a broad range of IP titles to minimize risk and accelerate silicon success. Our design automation and Design IP businesses have both leadership technology and market positions with industry trends playing to our strengths.', ""We're increasing our investment in these segments to capture more of this growing TAM. We started our investments in software integrity with the acquisition of Coverity in 2014. Software security was a pain point for every company, and risk surfaces were expanding. Customers were searching for innovative approaches in quality and security testing to help reduce the risk of software failures and security breaches. And we developed the broadest portfolio to meet that need. Flash forward to today, our software integrity business has become the leader in application security testing with industry leading team delivering over $0.5 billion in trailing 12 months revenue at mid-teens non-GAAP operating margin. We are proud of the significant progress we've made over the last nine years and believe the future opportunity remains attractive."", ""At the same time, we have compelling investment opportunities in design automation and Design IT with much higher expected growth and return profiles. Following our strategic portfolio review and in consultation with the company's Board of Directors, we have decided to explore strategic alternatives for the software integrity business. As part of this process, we're considering full range of strategic opportunities. We will provide an update after we conclude that process. Based on these market and technology trends and with high confidence in our business, here are our 2024 guidance targets. We expect 2024 revenue between $6.57 and $6.63 billion. We expect to deliver 37% non-GAAP operating margin, a 200 basis point improvement versus last year."", ""We expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $13.33 and $13.41. Shelagh will discuss the financials in more detail. Now I'll share some segment highlights starting with design automation. This quarter, Synopsys.ai was selected by AspenCore to receive the World Electronics Achievement Award for EDA Software of the Year. We're proud of the recognition, but even more excited by the strong customer adoption for Synopsys.ai across the design flow. A major North American hyperscaler made a major commitment to use DSO.ai after demonstrating PPA and productivity benefits on consecutive HPC projects. In verification, we engaged with over 20 customers in Q4, demonstrating up to 10x faster turnaround time. While in test, we added eight new customer engagements with [KIOXIA] (ph) publicly highlighting more than 50% pattern reduction."", ""Finally, we and TSMC announced that our analog migration flow through Synopsys.ai is enabled across TSMC's advanced process technologies. We are also seeing great results deploying Synopsys.ai internally with our IP teams. Internal IP teams are seeing 10x turnaround time improvements in time to target verification coverage and have deployed analog design migration flows for TSMC 2 nanometer. Fusion Compiler continues to win key designs including the leading edge Arm mobile core for the industry's first implementation for a gate-all-around based mobile SoC. In combination with DSO.ai, Fusion Compiler also delivered 10% better power on gate-all-around based mobile GPU and modem designs. We saw continued momentum in sign-off, delivered by our leadership family of prime tools."", ""We won multiple engagements with PrimeTime, PrimeClosure, and PrimeShield, and saw the world's top three data center providers adopt PrimeClosure to get the fastest ECO closure time for five 3-nanometer SoCs. Expanding our multi-die ecosystem, we received the prestigious leadership award from TSMC, OIP 2023 Partner of the Year, for developing the industry's first 3D IC design prototyping solution, supporting the new industry standard 3D blocks. Verification, product momentum also remains strong. This quarter, we announced our AI-driven next generation Verdi solution, which continues its lead in functional debug with deployment already at more than top semiconductor companies. In hardware assisted verification, we delivered another record year."", 'In Q4, ZeBu won against competition at two large North American hyperscalers, and we expanded our HAPS footprint with a large North American systems company and a large Asian semiconductor company. Now turning to Design IP. This quarter, we won our first 2-nanometer interface IP engagement with a leading mobile company and are now in production at 3 nanometer with foundation IP for a high-volume PC chip. We delivered a key multi-die proof point in concert with Intel and TSMC on UCIe interoperability. The demonstration at Intel Innovation showed die-to-die interconnect over UCIe between Synopsys IP on TSMC and 3E and Intel Foundry Silicon. We saw two other key technology proof points this quarter. We demonstrated interoperability for our 224 gig Ethernet PHY IP and PCIe 6.0 IP, both industry firsts.', 'On the processor IP side, we announced a new addition to the ARC processor IP portfolio, the RISC-V ARC-V processor IP. This product allows customers to choose from a broad range of flexible, extensible processor options that deliver optimal power performance efficiency for their target applications. Finally, we delivered a significant win in automotive, displacing competition at a marquee customer in a multi-generation, multiple project agreement. Now, to the software integrity segment, which delivered solid growth against the backdrop of continued macro headwinds for enterprise software. In Q4, we saw over 50% year-over-year growth in our Polaris software integrity platform. Polaris is a SaaS based application security testing solution optimized for the needs of development and DevSecOps teams.', ""We were also recently recognized as a leader in the Forrester Wave for Software Composition Analysis. This was based on an evaluation of Black Duck, our software composition analysis solution. In summary, we had an outstanding Q4 and FY 2023 financial results and operational execution and take tremendous forward momentum into 2024. We have a resilient business model and our customers continue to prioritize investments in the chips and systems that position them for future growth. We are aligning our portfolio investment with the greatest return potential to accelerate our growth, deepest thanks to our employees, partners, and customers for their passion and commitment. With that, I'll turn it over to Shelagh."", 'Shelagh Glaser: Thank you, Sassine. 2023 was an excellent year highlighted by record revenue, record non-GAAP operating margin, and record earnings. We continue our strong execution with financial discipline and are confident in our business heading into 2024, driven by our execution and leadership position across our segment, robust chip and system design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles and with $8.6 billion in non-cancellable backlog, the stability and resilience of our time-based business model. As a result, while the macro environment is uncertain. We expect to grow revenue 12.4% to 13.5%, expand non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points, and drive non-GAAP PPS growth of 19% to 20% in 2024.', 'Let me provide some highlights of our full year 2023 results.

In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness.

The analysts said that GE HealthCare management believes AI can help clinicians and radiologists do their jobs better, which is important due to the “ongoing shortage of radiologists and the high rates of burn out.”', 'The analysts also shared an upbeat update from GE HealthCare, which said hospitals have become more optimistic on capital budgets for next year, and there is no lingering impact from China’s anti-corruption campaign.', 'GE HealthCare and Hologic have both invested in AI to enhance their offerings to radiologists in recent years. In February, GE HealthCare disclosed an agreement to buy Caption Health, a provider of AI that assists in conducting ultrasound scans, in a deal later revealed to be worth $127 million upfront. The BTIG analysts shared their thoughts on the technology after visiting GE HealthCare’s booth at the event.', ""“We saw the power of Caption Health and the value additive features it offers on cardiac ultrasound applications. Within 6 months of the acquisition, [GE HealthCare] has integrated Caption Health's technology into their own ultrasound equipment,”\xa0the analysts wrote in a note to investors. “The features are primarily used in ERs but we would expect to see the features move to other ultrasound areas over time.” "", 'GE HealthCare’s management identified four applications for AI in radiology: improved image quality, enhanced user capabilities and efficiency, diagnosis and quality control. The technology could boost productivity, according to the analysts, particularly in ultrasound.', 'Hologic used the event to promote its Genius AI Detection 2.0 solution, deep-learning technology for flagging potential breast cancer cases. The company has linked the technology to a more than 70% reduction in false-positive markings per case compared to its own ImageChecker CAD solution.', '“Version 1.0 used machine learning algorithms back in 2003 but it had to teach the software what to look for,”\xa0the BTIG analysts wrote. “Today, with Version 2.0 deep-learning capabilities allow fellowship trained radiologists to enter and mark up a few mammography images and the software can learn just from looking at prior data and the software goes pixel by pixel.”', 'Away from AI, GE HealthCare provided a broader update on some of the macroeconomic forces that will shape its financial results, and those of its peers, in the coming quarters. The company’s internal survey data suggests hospitals are becoming more optimistic about their capital budgets, a change that could drive purchases of imaging equipment, and management was encouraged by a recent trip to China.', 'GE HealthCare grew revenue year over year by 5% to $4.8 billion in the third quarter, despite hospitals operating with more constrained budgets and China’s anti-corruption campaign.', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

Apple and Paramount are considering bundling their streaming services and offering them to subscribers at a discount, according to the Wall Street Journal.', 'The possible partnership comes as media and tech companies struggle to make their streaming services profitable and consumers tire of having to jump between multiple services to watch what they want.', '“It’s a great way for these media companies to morph into what looks like could be the future,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at media analytics company Comscore.', 'Since Netflix introduced the idea of a broad, general market streamer that produces its own content, Wall Street has mostly prioritized subscriber growth and revenue over profitability—as is usually the case when evaluating tech companies. When legacy media players like Disney, HBO, and Paramount entered the streaming wars, they used the same approach of chasing subscribers at all costs. After several years of burning money and failing to catch Netflix, they realized their losses were unsustainable. Executives and investors began to question the big spending, and companies are now focused on profitability—even if they haven’t necessarily achieved it yet.', 'Paramount has struggled to turn a profit on its Paramount+ streaming service that has 63 million subscribers. But it made strides in the third quarter when it narrowed losses to $238 million compared with $343 million over the same period in 2022, which beat analyst expectations.', 'Paramount has been particularly open to striking deals with other companies to increase its subscriber numbers. Internationally, its distribution partners include cable providers in Italy, Germany, France, and South Korea. In January, Paramount also inked a deal with Delta that gives passengers access to its entire streaming catalog during flights. And in May, Paramount+ signed on to be included for free in a Walmart+ subscription, echoing Amazon’s inclusion of free streaming with its e-commerce discounts.', 'On Friday, investors applauded Paramount’s possible agreement with Apple, sending Paramount’s stock up 10% in midday trading.', 'Apple has yet to release subscriber numbers or revenue figures for Apple TV+, but in May, research firm Antenna estimated it had about 20 million subscribers. On Apple’s latest earnings call CEO Tim Cook said Apple TV+ hit a quarterly record for revenue. Apple TV+ is part of Apple’s services business, which while outside its core products of phones and laptops, is becoming increasingly critical to the company’s strategy. Apple has shown a willingness to use its deep pockets to fund high-budget productions for its streaming service. This year, Apple produced Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon and Ridley Scott’s Napoleon, a biopic of the French emperor, that each cost about $200 million. Its original pictures have also gained coveted awards recognition as when CODA, a movie about a deaf family, won Best Picture at the 2022 Oscars.', 'Paramount declined to comment; and Apple did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Paramount and Apple aren’t alone in their partnership push. Warner Bros. Discovery is considering pairing its Max service with Netflix in a deal that would only be available to Verizon subscribers. Meanwhile Disney offers a discount to consumers who subscribe to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, all three of which it owns.', '“Bottom line: The consumer just wants to know, ‘Where’s my favorite show or movie?’” says Dergarabedian. “Combining them is a benefit to the consumer, and it’s great for these companies who clearly see a benefit to teaming up rather than being in separate silos, in a sense, fragmented and isolated.”', 'Despite some wariness about partnering with competitors, streamers are open to doing so because they believe it can reduce customer cancellations—called churn in the industry—after they’re done watching a specific show or movie. For consumers, there’s also the obvious benefit of saving money because the bundles generally cost less than if bought separately.', '“If you’re buying à la carte off a menu, it’s going to cost you more than if you’re buying the prix fixe menu, which essentially this is,” Dergarabedian says.', 'Prices for streaming services have risen steadily in recent months, partly because companies are betting most consumers will accept cost increases rather than cancel altogether. “Our plans tend to be relatively sticky,” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said on the company’s third quarter earnings call when asked about price increases.', 'For consumers who don’t want to pay for expensive subscriptions, streamers hope to steer them toward cheaper ad-supported options that are more lucrative because they generate both subscription revenue from users and ad revenue from brands. In fact, streaming services have been credited with contributing to much of the growth in the $326 billion ad market, in a year in which spending otherwise slowed down.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

You can't take the Adobe numbers out of context and project what's going on in retail. Those are only e-commerce numbers. And most of the numbers that have quoted are just totally consistent with the year-over-year growth that e-commerce has had all along because e-commerce is taking share."", ""We're not so sure what's happening in bricks-and-mortar retailing. But from what I've heard, a lot of what we saw in growth on the internet was at the expense of bricks and mortar. So be careful. It may not be that astounding a holiday season as people are streaming record numbers on Black Friday. All of that not so clear."", ""Given that environment, I still think, you know, the winners are those that provide tremendous value. Walmart has done great. I think they're performing as well as I've ever seen them perform. Their position in the area the consumer is focused on, which is closer in necessities, groceries, things like that, they're going to continue to do fantastic."", 'Costco continues to perform at very high level. TJX, very high level, excellent company, numbers that are fantastic. And then, of course, Amazon because that internet is growing and they are clearly the best on the internet.', ""Meanwhile, retailer after retailer, the other guys, they're reporting big negative numbers. Sometimes the stock has seen a surge. Like, you know, we've seen that recently with some companies that showed higher earnings than expected."", ""But look at the sales. Best Buy negative 7, Lowe's negative 7, Nordstrom's negative 7 same store sales, Macy's negative 7, Kohl's down 6, Target down 5, Home Depot down 4. There is a lot of carnage out there on the top line for sure in retailers right now because consumer is not open up their wallet and buying like crazy."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And Simeon, when you look at your coverage universe, get you in here too, who are some of the winners and losers in retail. Looking ahead, Simeon, break it down for us. Discounters, luxury, athletic gear, what do you see?', ""SIMEON SEIGEL: Josh Lipton, you bring me back in. I'm keeping notes on the things that I wanted to catch up on. One I wanted to point out that retail is all about storytelling, so back to the turnaround story. Let's keep in mind the marketing."", ""No, so-- listen, I think that Victoria's Secret reported today, they told us that November feels up. Like, they told us that Black Friday, the weekend, was good. And that obviously is a big store business."", ""So I think that what we do, everything I've been seeing-- so I generally agree with Jerry that a lot of these numbers we have to take with grains of salt or context. But the people that I'm talking to, what we are seeing, what we're hearing, I think so far the Black Friday weekend, the holiday has gotten off to a good start. I think the biggest question is going to be less did it perform now and more what's going to happen in the lull? We've got a long time between now and Christmas."", ""So I think that's going to be this interesting dynamic of did the strength that starts, does it carry through? And when we think about what Victoria's Secret said, they did guide January and December to see a material step down. So that'll be one thing worth watching."", ""But I'm going to-- I'm going to be a little bit more I think optimistic and flag that most of consumer just reported. And from what I'm looking at a little over 50% reported revenue growth and they all saw fantastic gross margin. So I think it is a little bit more of a case by case and, kind of, Jerry went through the winners."", ""And so I think when I look through this, I'm seeing a dichotomy, but it's not as much group agnostic. I'm seeing a lot of pairings. I'm seeing companies like Athleta see revenues down and we'll see Lulu up, right? You're seeing companies like Coach up and Michael Kors down. They sell the same thing."", ""And that works with the big box as well and so that works in off price as well. You're watching Nordstrom Rack and Old Navy who have revenues down and [INAUDIBLE] be up. So I think right now we're finally in this environment where winners, people who predict their demand well, are going to continue to win and those that don't are going to lose. That's an interesting retail opportunity. And so that actually makes me a little bit more optimistic.""]"

Generative AI has quickly shown a high potential to change the way we communicate with the digital world – and it can bring a similar potential to other fields, from automobiles to healthcare.', 'The magnitude of AI’s potential is clear from the estimates: tech experts are predicting that AI’s application to the healthcare market could exceed $100 billion before 2030. The gains will come on the heels of AI’s contributions in the health and medical fields. These contributions include improvements in refined diagnoses, reduced medical errors, and consequently enhanced patient outcomes. AI may even be able to promote lower costs and greater efficiencies.', 'AI’s growing and varied contributions to the healthcare industry are proving their worth and bringing out a solid set of opportunities for investors willing to go in for the long term on healthcare stocks.', 'The analysts at Cowen have seen it too, noting: “We are seeing an increase in AI-based clinical trials and a significant increase in the number of partnerships with AI tools players, and we believe that this is only the beginning…”', 'Moving on to concrete suggestions, the firm’s analysts are pointing to 2 AI healthcare stocks that investors should definitely consider.

Evotec, which is based in Germany, exemplifies the international nature of the medical field, with long-term partnership arrangements with Bayer, Bristol Meyers Squibb, Lilly, Sanofi, Takeda – and that’s just a part of the list. The company has described its approach to research and development as building a ‘data-driven autobahn to cures.’', 'In mid-November, Evotec publicly presented its AI-driven development platforms. The company is leveraging AI-technology to move toward higher capital efficiency, faster growth, and entry into new markets. Short-term, the goal is the creation of better precision-targeted drug candidates; long term, the goal is to improve patient outcomes and achieve higher commercial success.', 'Getting down to the base, the important factor for investors, we find that Evotec has an extensive pipeline of drug candidates, the company’s ‘product opportunities.’ The pipeline contains projects at every level of the clinical and regulatory process, from early discovery work to pre-clinical research to active human-trial clinical studies. The drug candidate programs target conditions in a wide variety of medical fields, including such ‘hot’ fields as neurology, oncology, immunology, and inflammatory diseases.', 'All of this forms a sound base for a biotech, and caught the attention Steve Mah. He writes of the company and its variegated research programs, “Evotec has built an ‘innovation hub’ to discover and develop pharmaceutical drugs. The hub leverages the expertise of 3,000+ scientists and drug developers in conjunction with a network of platforms that leverage synthetic biology technologies, integrated analysis of ‘omic’ datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), and data-driven AI and machine learning models.”', 'Tracking forward from here, Mah goes on to outline why Evotec in particular should impress investors, saying, “Differentiated capabilities are at the core of the EVO thesis with their innovative end-to-end process that offers higher probability of success, increased yields, and reduced manufacturing COGS for their pharma partners.”', 'Mah quantifies his stance on Evotec with an Outperform (Buy) rating, and a $21 price target that points toward ~110% upside in the coming months.

By market cap, Amgen ranks sixth among US biopharmaceutical firms, and by annual revenue it ranks as number 18 on the global scene. Amgen employs some 5,000 people at its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California, making it a major employer in its home state. Overall, the company has some 24,000 employees worldwide.', 'Like most of its peers, Amgen has both approved drugs on the market and a wide-ranging development pipeline for novel drug candidates. This gives the company a solid revenue stream from the marketable products, totaling $26 billion last year. Amgen is expanding its top line this year; for the first nine months of 2023, the company brought in $19.87 billion, achieving a 2.8% increase when compared to the same period last year.', 'Amgen actively works with AI tech, using AI and machine learning to boost selected development programs. The company’s drug candidate AMG 193 has particularly benefited from this. This candidate, currently at the Phase 1 clinical stage, is a small molecule methylthioadenosine (MTA) cooperative protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibitor, and has applications in the treatment of solid tumors. This program, with its potential for success and gains, is presented by the company has a prime example of how AI and top-end data science can boost biotech research.', 'Elsewhere in the pipeline, one of Amgen’s most advanced products is Tarlatamab, a BiTE molecule designed to combat various cancers. The drug is currently undergoing a Phase 3 trial as a treatment for small cell lung cancer, and a Phase 1 trial against neuroendocrine prostate cancer. The company recently presented positive data from a Phase 2 trial on the lung cancer track.', 'Amgen is also aggressively pursuing the treatment of metabolically-related obesity, and has two drugs in the pipeline that show high promise in this area. AMG 786 is a small molecule compound, and AMG 133 is a multispecific molecule deigned to inhibit the GIPR receptor while activating the GLP-1 receptor. AMG 133 is undergoing a Phase 2 study in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes. Study enrollment has been completed, and topline data is expected late in 2024.', 'Key results from Amgen’s 3Q23 included a total revenue number of $6.9 billion, 4% higher than the prior-year quarter although $45 million below expectations. The bottom line came to $4.96, growing 6% y/y and beating the forecast by 28 cents.', 'For Cowen’s 5-star analyst Yaron Weber, Amgen presents a compelling big picture. The company makes solid use of AI, and Weber writes of it, “Amgen’s goal is to use AI to build a next-generation research pipeline that is unique in its combination of both computational and wet lab capabilities. The company’s efforts include a balance of internal as well as external partnerships and acquisitions. The company uses the term ‘generative biology’ to describe its integration of protein drug discovery and design with AI and machine learning. Towards this end, Amgen has invested in wet lab high throughput automation and dry lab computational biology, including the Digital Biologics Discovery group, which uses protein structure and function data to train computer models to make proteins with specific structure and function.”', 'Weber goes on to outline Amgen’s prospects for the near term, writing, “We expect Amgen’s diversified late-stage pipeline and early-stage pipeline powered by their AI/machine learning capabilities should bolster their long-term outlook as early and late-stage clinical assets (including their PRMT5 inhibitor AMG 193, a product of their AI platforms) gain more visibility and advance through clinical development.”', 'Weber rates AMGN shares as Outperform (i.e. Buy), and he puts a $336 price target on the stock, indicating room for a 24% increase in the coming year.

Third-quarter adjusted earnings of 36 cents per share were below the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 38 cents, while adjusted Ebitda of $933 million was under what Bank of America had expected. The weak performance was the result of higher unit costs, and the management team went on to reduce its 2023 gold production guidance due to problems with its Ahafo operations.', 'Still, free cash flow trends appear strong, and rising gold prices lately should help the company hit its targets over the coming quarters. Lower interest rates and stabilizing labor costs are also macro tailwinds investors should consider. What was encouraging was the stock actually rallied in the wake of the earnings per share miss and full-year production guidance slash.', ""The completion of the gold miner's acquisition of Newcrest Mining may have been seen as a boon when looking ahead to 2024. Another positive catalyst may have been the company trimming its net debt position and $399 million of reported free cash flow was impressive. Key risks for Newmont and the industry writ large include rising real interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar, higher labor costs and uncertain capital expenditure outcomes."", ""On valuation, analysts at Bank of America see earnings rebounding sharply in 2024 after a protracted period of falling earnings per share trends from 2022 through the current fiscal year. Per-share profits are expected to approach $3 in 2024 and perhaps $4 by 2025, though the current consensus estimates are a bit lower compared with Bank of America's sanguine outlook. Consider, however, that gold prices are up significantly from the second and third quarters, so I would not be surprised to see other sell-side shops increase their earnings targets for Newmont ahead of its fourth-quarter report early next year - that could make for positive headline risks over the coming weeks. Dividends, meanwhile, are expected to hold at the current $1.60 per year run rate before perhaps increasing in 2025."", ""If we assume $2.50 of fiscal year 2024 earnings and apply the stock's five-year average non-GAAP forward earnings multiple of 23, then the stock should trade near $58. Even if we discount that valuation with a margin of safety of about 15%, the stock is still about 20% undervalued today. What's more, higher real yields now compared to the five-year average suggests a lower price-earnings ratio of 20 is likely about right."", 'Source: BofA Global Research', 'Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show an unconfirmed fourth-quarter 2023 earnings date of Thursday, Feb. 22. Before that, the stock pays its 40-cent quarterly dividend on Friday, Dec. 22. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar.', 'Source: Wall Street Horizon', 'Newmont, like the ETF, made a bullish move in recent days. The bid to gold, taking it above $2,040 as of this writing, helped to lift Newmont above a key technical resistance point. Notice in the chart below that a bullish falling wedge pattern was in play for several months. The stock undercut its November 2022 low just under $38 early in the fourth quarter, which had the hallmarks of bear market price action. But with a series of lower highs and lower lows, but within a consolidating triangle pattern, a coil was being compressed. Then, in late November, a high-volume breakout took place, sending Newmont through the $40 mark. The move implies the stock should now rise into the low $50s based on the height of the falling wedge pattern at its onset, added on top of the breakout point. The low $50s zone is also about where I see intrinsic value of shares today.', ""Also take a look at the lows from 2021 in the low to mid-$50s the $53 to $55 range could be a challenging mark for the bulls if we see an extended rally in Newmont. I also see potential near-term trouble at the stock's long-term 200-day moving average, which is negatively sloped. Still, the relative strength index momentum indicator at the top of the chart shows the current price strength is the best since just after the Silicon Valley Bank banking crisis, when real yields were much lower."", 'Overall, I see more tailwinds than headwinds for Newmont here, and $50 could be in play over the coming months.', 'Source: Stockcharts.com', 'I see conditions right for a continued bounce in Newmont Mining. More favorable macro conditions, a decent valuation and positive technicals should set up well heading into 2024.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study General Dynamics'  ROE in this article."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for General Dynamics ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is:', '17% = US$3.3b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.17 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To start with, General Dynamics' ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Despite this, General Dynamics' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance."", ""As a next step, we compared General Dynamics' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 4.8% in the same period."", 'Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is GD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GD is currently mispriced by the market.', ""Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 41% (implying that the company keeps 59% of its income) over the last three years, General Dynamics has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating."", ""Additionally, General Dynamics has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 36%. Still, forecasts suggest that General Dynamics' future ROE will rise to 20% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much."", ""On the whole, we do feel that General Dynamics has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth.

I will begin my remarks today with highlights of our consolidated results before providing more details on the performance of each of our segments. Our team executed well against the evolving backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and other industry factors that had varied impacts on discrete categories within our Dental and Animal Health segments. I'll start with key highlights and strong performance in the quarter. In the Dental segment, Patterson's broad and resilient consumables portfolio enabled us to deliver sales growth above market growth amidst steady patient demand. And our core equipment category delivered solid year-over-year growth despite a tough comparison to last year's strong second quarter performance."", 'In Animal Health, our market leading production animal business achieved strong sales growth primarily due to the leading omnichannel presence that Patterson has built to best serve producers. And in both of our business segments, our value added services categories, including our software offerings, achieved significant growth that outpaced overall sales and sales within the Dental and Animal Health segments. Offsetting these results, we experienced softer than expected demand in two areas of our business. Macroeconomic conditions impacted our performance in the high tech dental equipment categories, and our companion animal business was impacted by a decline in vet clinic visits and spending. Ultimately, we delivered second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.50.', ""We also returned $86 million in capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Looking forward, we believe that macroeconomic and industry challenges are likely to persist for the duration of our fiscal year. We, therefore, have adjusted our fiscal 2024 guidance to reflect our revised expectations for the year. We now expect to deliver adjusted earnings in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 per diluted share, a decline of 4% at the midpoint of our previous range. We remain focused on executing against our proven strategy, which, as a reminder, is designed to achieve four core objectives; first, drive revenue growth above the current end market growth rates; second, build upon the progress we've made to enhance our margin performance; third, evolve our products, channels and services to best serve the customers in our end markets; and fourth, improve efficiency and optimization."", ""Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment during the second quarter, we continued investing across our business in service of our long term strategic objectives. This includes investments in our distribution capabilities, software offerings and value added services to further differentiate Patterson as a partner of choice for our customers. We are focused on managing Patterson for the long term because we are confident in the strength and resilience of our end markets and in Patterson's ability to perform for our customers and our shareholders. I'd like to touch on some of the targeted investments we made during the second quarter that we expect will drive our efficiency and optimization over the long term. First, we recently completed the expansion of a distribution facility dedicated to our Dental business in Canada."", ""We believe the expanded facility in Montreal will enhance our ability to serve customers on the east side of the country and add state of the art features that will drive efficiencies. Second, we successfully completed the implementation of our ERP system in Canada. This is an important milestone in our ERP rollout, connecting our US and Canada operations to provide greater visibility across our North American operations to drive meaningful efficiencies. And finally, Patterson also continued to invest behind our robust suite of software solutions in both our Dental and Animal Health segments. As we've discussed previously, we believe the opportunity for growth within software is meaningful. And we're investing to build upon our strong foundation, add to our capabilities and address evolving customer preferences."", ""In our fiscal 2024 second quarter, we added technical personnel and other resources to our Dental software team and are pleased with the progress we have made toward an even stronger offering and customer experience. We're building a track record and driving returns from our strategic investments, and we expect that performance to continue. For example, last year, Patterson completed acquisitions of Dairy Tech and RSVP and ACT. Today, those businesses are performing even better than our expectations. The Dairy Tech owned brand is a positive margin contributor in our production animal business and the RSVP platform for veterinarian staffing is solving today's most critical challenge for our animal health customers. And to meet that demand, we continue to expand RSVP to serve more of Patterson's customers."", ""As we move through the second half of fiscal '24, we plan to continue to balance our investment strategy with cost discipline to calibrate our expenses appropriately within the macroeconomic environment. I am proud of the Patterson team and the way we are navigating a dynamic macroeconomic environment to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders. We continue to believe that the strength of our team, the resiliency of the Dental and Animal Health end markets and our comprehensive value proposition make Patterson well positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long term. Now I'll provide more detail on the performance of each of our two business segments during the fiscal second quarter. Let's start with Dental."", 'In the second quarter, Dental segment internal sales declined 0.2% year-over-year. As I mentioned, our consumables category performed very well in the quarter with 3% internal sales growth, including the negative deflationary impact of certain infection control product prices. Excluding those infection control products, we saw a nearly 5% sales growth. We attribute this strong performance to a few key factors; first, steady patient traffic for standard dentistry; second, our long-term consistent commitment to strengthening our relationships with our customers; third, our broad and resilient Dental consumables portfolio, including an expansive suite of private label products, which targets our customer base; and finally, the strong execution by our team.', ""Taken together, these factors enabled Patterson to perform well in the consumables category and insulated us from macroeconomic headwinds that caused some patients to postpone specialty procedures. On the Dental equipment side, internal sales declined 6% year-over-year. Patterson achieved continued growth in core equipment during the quarter, even on top of last year's strong growth. However, this growth was more than offset by declining sales of high tech equipment during the quarter. Our digital and CAD/CAM businesses faced industry headwinds from the broader economic environment as well as lengthening upgrade cycles and continued pricing pressure. Moving forward, we are encouraged by the fact that our manufacturing partners have indicated long term plans to invest and innovate in these important product categories."", ""This is a testament to the continued long term demand for these types of products. And when there's new innovation, Patterson has a leading capability to sell, finance, install and service all Dental equipment. And finally, Dental internal sales in our value added services category increased approximately 3% over the prior year period. Value added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that enhance the customer experience, drive loyalty and help make Patterson an indispensable partner to their practice. Dental value added services continued to grow at a pace exceeding the rate of the Dental segment sales overall and remain a key strategic focus and significant growth opportunity for Patterson. We are dedicated to continuously deepening Patterson's Dental value position and positioning ourselves for continued success in a healthy and attractive market that is supported by enduring trends, including an aging population, a drive towards practice modernization and heightened awareness of the link between oral health and overall health."", ""We remain confident in our team's ability to effectively navigate ongoing macroeconomic and industry challenges and achieve our long term goals. Now let's move on to our Animal Health segment. During the second quarter, Patterson's Animal Health segment internal sales increased 0.2% year-over-year. Even in environment of modest growth, we're seeing evidence that Patterson's deep and broad value proposition across species and multiple channels continues to be a driver of our success. In companion animal, our internal sales declined by low single digits as veterinary clinic business decreased and spending moderated. As I mentioned, we attribute this decrease to moderation in the companion animal industry [hastened] by a tough economic climate for consumers navigating inflation and other challenges."", ""However, it's important to put this quarter into broader context of the long term health of this end market. As we look ahead, we expect this market as a whole to grow in the low single digits over the long term, supported by positive long term trends in pet parenting. On the production animal side, second quarter internal sales grew by mid single digits. A strong performance in production reaffirms the strength of our omnichannel presence, highly tailored distribution strategy and comprehensive offering across animal species. Those strategies executed by our talented and tenured team enabled us to continue to win new business and outperform the broader production animal market. Secondarily, our performance also benefited because of the more historical timing of the annual fall run and movement of cattle to feed yards."", ""Across the Animal Health segment, our value added services category grew rapidly due to increased demand for our software solutions and equipment services, as well as new programs to drive revenue and operational efficiency in freight. We're also confident that the opportunity for continued growth within software remains significant, and we continue to invest in existing solutions to better leverage our strong foundation, add to our capabilities and address evolving customer preferences. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more detail on our financial results."", ""Kevin Barry: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our second quarter of fiscal '24, which ended on October 28, 2023 and then conclude with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. So let's begin by covering the results for our second quarter of fiscal '24. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal '24 second quarter were $1.65 billion, an increase of 1.6% over the second quarter of one year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation, contributions from recent acquisitions and the net impact of an interest rate swap increased 1% compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was 20.5%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year period."", ""Beginning with our fiscal '24 second quarter, we have also provided adjusted gross margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts gross margin for the impact of the mark to market accounting related to our equipment financing portfolio and the associated interest rate swap hedging instruments. We will provide this additional non-GAAP financial measure going forward as it adjusts for the impact of interest rate fluctuations net of the mark to market swap adjustment within the P&L. In particular, this adjustment classifies the gain or loss on the interest rate swap from other income expense to net sales to align the swap impact with the impact on customer financing net sales. Remember, the accounting impact of the mark to market adjustment impacts our total company gross margin but not the gross margin within our business segment."", ""And as before, the net impact of interest rate fluctuations between the swap and the equipment financing portfolio has a minimal impact on net income. For the second quarter of fiscal '24, our adjusted gross margin was 20.6% compared to 20.8% in the year ago period. We provided these comparative numbers for the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, and we have included reconciliations for the first quarter in today's press release. Importantly, during the second quarter of fiscal '24, both of our business units posted a year-over-year increase to their respective gross margins compared to the prior year period. The initiatives we have put in place to improve gross margin, working more closely with strategic vendors who reward us for our sales performance, drive improved mix, exercise expense discipline and leverage our cost structure, have translated into improved gross margins for both of our business units."", ""Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '24 were 16.5% and unfavorable by 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.2%, a decrease of 80 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Note that our adjusted operating margin now includes the impact of the interest rate swap adjustment mentioned previously. In the second half of fiscal '24, we plan to continue to effectively manage our expenses, while executing on the margin initiatives that have been yielding results within our business segments and for the company overall. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was 25.1%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year period."", ""Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $40 million or $0.42 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the second quarter of last year of $54.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $47.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share. This compares to $61.2 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '23. This decrease in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal second quarter was primarily due to lower sales of Dental high technology equipment and increased operating expenses compared to the prior year period. Now let's turn to our business segments, starting with the Dental business."", ""In the second quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales for our Dental business decreased 0.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. Internal sales of Dental consumables in the fiscal second quarter increased 2.9% compared to one year ago despite being impacted by continued price deflation of certain infection control products. Internal sales of non-infection control products increased 4.7% in the second quarter of fiscal '24 compared to the year ago period. This negative impact from infection control product deflation has steadily moderated over the past year and we expect the year-over-year deflationary effect to continue moderating and fully normalize at the end of fiscal year '24. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales of Dental equipment decreased 6.3% compared to one year ago."", ""This quarter, core equipment posted positive growth that was more than offset by a decline in the digital X-ray and CAD/CAM product category as compared to the prior year period. We believe the year-over-year decline in these two categories was the result of macroeconomic concerns on some equipment purchasing decisions as well as selling price declines within the imaging categories. Internal sales of value added services in the second quarter of fiscal '24 increased 3.1% over the prior year period led by the continued growth of our software business and increased year-over-year contribution from our technical service team. Value added services, including our software offerings, represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make us an indispensable partner to their practice and these valuable offerings are also mix favorable to our P&L."", ""The adjusted operating margin in Dental was 9.4% in the second quarter of fiscal '24, which represents an 80 basis point decrease over the prior year period. While gross margins in the Dental business for the second quarter of fiscal '24 improved year-over-year, increased operating expenses related to our SAP implementation and warehouse expansion in Canada along with investments in our software and technical service business drove the unfavorability in adjusted operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Now let's move to our Animal Health segment. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 0.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. Internal sales for our companion animal business in the second quarter of fiscal '24 decreased 3.6% over the prior year period."", ""Strong sales performance from our NVS business in the UK was more than offset by declines in the US companion animal business. Internal sales for our production animal business in the fiscal second quarter increased 4.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. Our production animal team continues to execute well in the market and our omnichannel approach across several species continues to pay off with sales growth above the overall market. The adjusted operating margin in our Animal Health segment was 3.6% in the fiscal '24 second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margins in our Animal Health segment were up in the fiscal '24 second quarter and an increase in operating expenses on a year-over-year basis drove the operating margin decrease compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23."", ""Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first six months of fiscal '24, our free cash flow improved by $28.0 million compared to the same period one year ago. This was primarily due to a decreased level of working capital in the first sixmonths of fiscal '24 compared to the year ago period. Turning now to capital allocation. Our capital spending in the first 6 months of fiscal '24 was $33.5 million and $6.7 million higher than the first six months of fiscal '23. This increased spending reflects the investments we are making in our distribution capabilities as well as software and value added services. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal '24."", ""We also repurchased approximately $61 million of shares during the second quarter of fiscal '24, thereby returning a total of $85.9 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Let me conclude with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '24. Today, we are revising our fiscal '24 GAAP earnings guidance to a range of $2.04 to $2.14 per diluted share and our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.35 to $2.45 per diluted share. We have made these revisions to our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share guidance to account for the macroeconomic environment and uncertainty that we believe will persist for the remainder of our fiscal '24 year. Now I will turn the call back over to Don for some additional comments."", 'Don Zurbay: Thanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to thank the entire Patterson team for their continued hard work and commitment to our strategy serving our customers. Looking forward, the macroeconomic challenges we experienced during the second quarter do not change our strategic objectives or confidence in the health and attractiveness of our end markets. We continue to believe that Patterson is well positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation as we execute our strategy over the long term. That concludes our prepared remarks.

Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 35%, which is in a comfortable range for us.', 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.72 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.92. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.4% per annum over that time.

The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Williams Companies' shares before the 7th of December to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.45 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.79 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Williams Companies has a trailing yield of approximately 4.8% on its current stock price of $37.28.

As a result, readers should always check whether Williams Companies has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Williams Companies ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Its dividend payout ratio is 77% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Williams Companies generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 81% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth."", ""It's positive to see that Williams Companies's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's not ideal to see Williams Companies's earnings per share have been shrinking at 2.7% a year over the previous five years."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Williams Companies has increased its dividend at approximately 2.2% a year on average. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Williams Companies is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future."", ""Is Williams Companies an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? While earnings per share are shrinking, it's encouraging to see that at least Williams Companies's dividend appears sustainable, with earnings and cashflow payout ratios that are within reasonable bounds. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now."", ""So if you're still interested in Williams Companies despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock.

While there is still uncertainty in the macro backdrop, we're encouraged by the building momentum against our strategic initiatives, as I'll discuss in more detail in a few moments. To summarize, however, we name a few key wins including solid strides in our digital performance including improving conversion levels and double-digit gains in new customer acquisition."", ""Increases in already (ph) high brand awareness levels suggesting our top-of-funnel marketing and brand building efforts are resonating. Stabilizing conversion trends in stores as product flows resonate and our in-store execution improves.

All-in looking ahead, we know that by continuing to lean into our Lace Up plan, we're on the right path towards longer-term shareholder value creation. Now before we dig into our Lace Up progress, I want to take a moment to talk specifically about our basketball business. Sneaker culture has long been influenced by sports and specifically basketball and that's why we are so excited about our recent agreement with the NBA for Foot Locker to serve as an official league marketing partner here in the U.S. Foot Locker in the NBA have a nearly 25-year history of working together and we're thrilled to be building on that in the years to come with this new partnership."", ""This season, you'll see Foot Locker and the NBA collaborate around exciting content, on court virtual signage featuring our iconic striper logo and activations around marquee events such as the NBA All-Star Game. We'll also be focused on social engagement and we're excited about reaching the NBA's 84 million followers on Instagram along with other platforms with our brand-building and commerce driving content. We'll focus on creating collaborative content highlighting our basketball products and point of view. The NBA will connected directly into our loyalty FLX program and will provide additional benefits and access to our customers in new and exciting ways. Our kick-off to announce a partnership featured a special basketball activation event in Times Square that featured over 50 members of our striper hype crew."", ""In early November, we also rolled out our new global brand platform, The Heart of Sneakers which is uniting our vision around the Foot Locker brand. This was a global launch with all our regions going live simultaneously and the response has been amazing. To date, we've earned over 1 billion media and influencer impressions since the campaign's launch. Our first campaign with the platform as our holiday campaign called Hype for the Holidays, which includes the star-studded roster of NBA All-Stars. We know that when we win basketball, it is good for us and importantly, it's good for our brand partners. We've been thrilled by the support they're showing in response to our basketball initiatives. Another key example of our basketball focus is the rollout of our new Home Court experience at our Foot Locker banner."", ""This is a unique multi-branded basketball experience with elevated merchandising, storytelling, and experiences. While still early days, and only a handful of our top basketball doors, early response by our customers has been very positive and we're continuing to invest in the concept. We will have more to report on in basketball in future quarters, but I hope you're taking away from my comments today, how much all of us here at Foot Locker are looking forward to further enhancing our customers' experiences and strengthening our already dominant basketball leadership in the months and years ahead. I'd like to now provide more details on the progress we're making within our Lace Up plan and the early wins we're achieving, both in stores and online."", ""As you know, there are four strategic pillars to Lace Up. So let me walk you through the momentum we're building in each of them. Our first is to expand sneaker culture by serving more sneaker occasions, providing more choice, and driving greater distinction. A key part of servicing our customers is making sure we're strong partners to all the brands we work with. This means collaborating with them on multi-year growth plans in consumer-facing marketing ideas, while also investing to mutually grow our businesses. Within Nike, we're seeing strong partnership between our teams as we build growth plans around our key pillars, basketball, kids, and sneaker culture. As I noted earlier, we believe the future of basketball is bright for Foot Locker and we're encouraged that the culture of basketball also continues to connect with consumers through models like the Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1, and Nike Dunk."", ""Retro sell-throughs remained solid in the third quarter, albeit with lower units compared to last year. We're also celebrating key moments with Nike, including the 25th Anniversary launch of the Nike Tuned Air franchise, one of our key exclusives with Nike and a core anchor in sneaker culture especially across EMEA where there is a rich heritage with this franchise. With Adidas, we continue to build momentum with their Terrace and Skate franchises, including the Samba, Gazelle, and Campus. Together with our exclusive Anthony Edwards basketball shoe launch this December, we have some powerful holiday moments ahead with Adidas. And as we think about strengthening our position in basketball, we were pleased with the recent launch of the Puma LaMelo 3 and we're also excited about Puma's renewed collaboration with Rihanna, which we'll be launching in stores and online tomorrow."", ""New Balance continued its strong run as we once again achieved well over 100% year-over-year sales increase in the third quarter with multiple franchises performing well across men's, women's, and kids. We continue to see door expansion opportunities in New Balance as we build on the share gains we've seen in this exciting brand. Within performance running, we continue to push ahead with our growth plans on On and HOKA. On is now in 420 doors ahead of our earlier plans for 350 doors this year as together, we accelerated expansion plans to meet the strong consumer response to their unique and innovative product. With HOKA, we've added 50 doors since last quarter, bringing our total door count to 150 ahead of holidays. We remain bullish on our partnership with these exciting newer brands and we are planning for even more door count expansion across these two brands next year."", ""At the same time, we also continue to achieve strong gains with brands like ASICS and Brooks in performance running. And we're seeing gains from brands such as Crocs and UGG on the more lifestyle side, as our customers are looking to us to offer brands that fit their whole lifestyle needs. Helping to drive distinction for Foot Locker, our exclusives penetration in the quarter was 15% similar to last year led by key franchises such as Nike's Tuned Air and Puma's LaMelo Ball. Finally, in our quest to meet our customers' desire for multiple brands across multiple occasions, the diversity of our brand mix outside of our top brand Nike increased to 36% of sales from 32% last year, making good progress towards our goal of over 40% by 2026. Our second imperative, power of the portfolio is about transforming our real estate footprint through new formats and shifting off-mall, while also simplifying our portfolio of banners and creating clear lanes for each of them."", ""On real estate transformation, we opened or converted 13 new Foot Locker Community and Power Stores across the globe in the third quarter, giving us a 198 stores in these newer formats. We continue to see comp trends in these locations outperform the remainder of the fleet with higher levels of traffic, conversion, and ticket. We also see a double-digit e-commerce halo in the markets around these locations. All-in, our new formats now represent approximately 13% of our global square footage, up from 10% last year and making progress against our 2026 target of 20%. Additionally, we're making strides with our overall shift to more off-mall exposure, penetration reached 36% of North American square footage up 3 points from a year ago and making progress towards our goal of 50% by 2026."", ""As to WSS, our off-mall banner, that is a leading retailer focused on athletic footwear for the Latino family, this year, we're on track to open 26 net new locations with four new locations in the third quarter and five year-to-date in the Miami, Florida market. Lastly, as part of our real estate transformation, we closed 14 underperforming stores during the quarter. Within simplifying and creating distinct lanes, during the quarter we announced the closure of our three U.S. Atmos stores and its website, which will be wound down in January. And as we think about the Lace Up framework of simplifying and investing to grow, this applies to Atmos as we focus its growth in its core market. At Champs, we continue to make headway with our repositioning work."", ""While comps declined by approximately 20% in the third quarter, the banner is actually tracking better than we originally expected at the beginning of the year, including a meaningful improvement in the October exit rate compared to the first-half trend. The team is getting even sharper with Champs' positioning towards the active athlete including positive early results from store refreshment in the third quarter that's planned for an accelerated rollout into year-end. With a more distinct store experience and an even sharper viewpoint on its assortment buys into the spring, we remain optimistic about the Champs Sports' potential in the marketplace. Our third pillar is deepening our relationship with our customers, which is focused on building brand equity reaching a broader set of customers and enhancing our loyalty program and overall CRM capabilities."", ""On building brand equity, we are better articulating and celebrating our brand proposition via our brand-building, storytelling, and marketing. In fact, we've seen gains in our unaided brand awareness, showing that our top-of-the-funnel marketing and brand-building efforts are resonating and driving greater mindshare with consumers. I noted earlier, the launch of our global brand platform and our Height for the Holidays campaign, which was named one of the best campaigns for holidays this year by Adweek. In the campaign, you'll see globally shared content featuring our stripers as hype crew dedicated to boosting up every day sneaker lovers, with the help of some very high-profile NBA athletes such as Kevin Durant, Anthony Edwards, LaMelo Ball, and Steph Curry along with international recording artist Enisa."", ""The campaign kicked off to tremendous success. As I noted earlier, we've seen over 1 billion impressions since our campaign launch. We are already seeing brand perception lift against key attributes such as trend, style, and service since the media launch. This work we're doing around greater top-of-funnel marketing including incremental marketing investment is driving consideration and customer acquisition at strong incremental returns. Case in point, once again, our online customer acquisition grew strong double-digits in the third quarter in North America and helped fuel our digital outperformance in the quarter. On loyalty, 23% of our sales in the third quarter were through our current loyalty program, compared to 22% last year. We're excited to launch our FLX cash test pilot in Canada in September and we've been pleased with the early results."", ""Encouragingly, we've seen a rise in active members, higher average order values versus non-loyalty, and a significant number of FLX cash redemptions by first-time users suggesting broader appeal as we refocused it to offer benefits beyond primarily launch access. As we learned from our pilot here in 2023, we're making progress in our plans to roll it out to the remainder of North America in 2024 and globally in 2025. And our final pillar is to be best-in-class omni which means improving our digital presence as well as better integrating our channels with each other. Our digital penetration in the quarter increased to 17%, up 150 basis points year-over-year. When excluding East Bay, which we closed late last year. For the second consecutive quarter, combined digital comps were positive in our Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker banners in North America, and given our improved digital execution, especially in mobile and traction with new customers company-wide we saw an accelerating nicely positive comp for all of global e-commerce in the month of October."", 'Our focus on site experience enhancements continues to generate significant wins, adding up to nearly $80 million of projected incremental annual sales with reduced friction points and improved experiences and features. Moving forward, we will continue to upgrade our site experience with improvements to our product listing and detail pages through elevated content, merchandising, and badging. Our plans for 2024 include the rollout of a new Foot Locker app with a new design intended to enable smoother, cleaner shopping experiences. We are focused on improving the product launch experience driving greater connectivity with the stores and greater loyalty integration. This work in combination with our marketing efforts gives us increasing confidence in our ability to achieve 25% e-commerce penetration over time.', ""Switching to stores, when you think about Foot Locker our stripers are essential to the overall customer experience. They are product and service experts who create a positive in-store experience with our NPS in stores already above 90. We want to maintain and even increase their passion and impact, which is why we keep them engaged in learning and ensure they have the tools they need to serve our customers. In the third quarter, we were pleased to launch a collection of new training and tools for our stripers across the globe specifically focused on driving advanced on-the-selling (ph) behaviors with the mantra of Always On, Never No. While fully launched later in the quarter we're beginning to see improved engagement and conversion in the stores."", ""We also finished the rollout of our upgraded handhelds to all North American stores. The technology gives our stripers improved visibility on inventory access to product information and the ability to checkout customers and improved in-store conversion. To sum up, while the retail environment remains dynamic, our teams are focused on staying nimble, particularly through this important holiday season. Even as we focus on supporting our topline and closely managing our inventory through the near term, we're continuing to go after the big future opportunities we see for our business. I'm confident, we are evolving Foot Locker to truly be all things sneakers and to be a competitive omni-channel retailer that can drive sustainable and profitable long-term growth and shareholder value."", 'Now, let me hand it over to Frank to provide more detail on our performance by banner.', ""Frank Bracken: Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Now let me comment on our third quarter performance, by category, footwear comped down high-single digits, while apparel fell mid-teens and accessories comped positive low-single digits. Starting with basketball, we are seeing continued strength in court classics and retro styles from Nike and Jordan. This includes Jordan Retro, AJ1, Air Force 1 and Dunk, which provided a meaningful connection to the culture of basketball for our men's, women's and kids consumer during the back-to-school season. Our signature basketball business also started to rebound in the third quarter. Puma's Melo ball 2 led our signature business in Q3 and was flanked by strong performance from the Nike JA 1 , LeBron in Jordan's Tatum 1."", ""Switching gears to the running category. New Balance continues to drive impressive growth across all banners and geographies. Importantly, this growth is fueled by multiple footwear franchises and is registering across our men's, women's and kids consumer. We were pleased to once again gain market share with the New Balance brand in Q3 and fully expect that trend to continue into the holiday season. We also remain excited about our consumers continued response to the HOKA brand and On Running. We continue to see these brands bring new customers into sneaker culture, while our banners help bring younger, more multi-cultural consumers to their brands. We expanded our door base with both brands (ph) in Q3 ahead of the holiday season, enabling access to more consumers."", 'And we are excited to partner with HOKA as they became the presenting sponsor of our 44th Annual Foot Locker Cross Country Championships. Thousands of elite high-school runners have been treated to footwear and apparel kits from HOKA, and we partnered to create on-site activations in content creation to fuel our social channels. Meanwhile, challenges remain within some lifestyle running platforms. It was in these areas that we remain promotional and working through inventory levels to get clean by the end of this year. While we still have work to do, I was encouraged by our results in the first weeks of November and especially during a strong Black Friday week. From a lifestyle standpoint, UGG played a meaningful role in our business this back-to-school, especially for our female consumers.', 'With a compelling assortment and must-have styles such as the Tasman, UGG quickly became one of our top footwear vendors for the quarter. Their strong brand connection to the fashion forward consumer gives us confidence that this trend will continue through the holiday season. Moving to apparel. We continue to see the consumer reacting positively to key items like Nike Tech Fleece and Nike Club Fleece. In our private-label brands, Locker in CSG also delivered strong sales productivity. However, the consumer has many options when it comes to apparel. And we will continue to be appropriately promotional this holiday season as we work through inventory and adjust our assortment strategies for 2024. As we look ahead to this holiday season, we are enthusiastic about a number of premium footwear opportunities we are seeing resonate with our consumers, including the scaling of Nike and Jordan signature basketball models at holiday and the excitement around our new NBA marketing partnership and the storytelling platform that it brings.', ""The December launch of the Jordan Retro 11 gratitude, the exclusive launch of Anthony Edwards signature basketball shoe with Adidas, the AE1, enhanced brand presentation, inventory levels and marketing with the New Balance brand, Rihanna's newest collaboration with Puma, the Fenty Creeper Phatty launching tomorrow, both online and in-stores, increased supply of trend-right Adidas models like Samba, Gazelle and Campus, seasonally relevant concepts and classics from UGG, and the continued momentum that we are experiencing and running through the HOKA and On brands. By channel, comparable sales in our stores decreased 8.5%. Traffic remained down year-on year and we continue to see some pressure on average ticket. Encouragingly, our conversion levels, while still down year-on year, saw a steady sequential improvement each month of the quarter as customers responded to our promotional efforts as well as our flow of premium must-have items."", ""Digital comps fell by 5.6%. However, excluding East Bay, the digital-only banner we wound down last year, digital comps were up 0.4%, including positive digital comps in October as our top of funnel marketing and efforts to improve conversion show gains. We're also pleased that our Foot Locker North-America and Kids Foot Locker banners once again saw combined positive digital comps in the quarter. By Banner and geography, in North America overall comps declined by 9.5%, including a 3.8% negative impact from the Champs sports repositioning efforts in the region. At Foot Locker North America, comps tell by 4.9%, driven by ongoing consumer and product headwinds in lifestyle running and apparel, offsetting strength in the culture of basketball and running innovation."", 'Encouragingly, our power in community stores continue to outcome the balance of chain in Q3, reinforcing our confidence in those new concepts. Kids Foot Locker comps were up 5%, led by a strong back-to-school in August in both stores and online. With a compelling assortment and strong back-to-school marketing, our KFL banner clearly connected with the huge consumer and their parents the season as well as the teen girl. With best-in-class partnerships with Nike, Jordan, New Balance and UGG, KFL is well-positioned to finish the year strong as we enter the holidays. At Champs sports, comps were down 20% as we prefer the Foot Locker banner for key launches and constrained supply of Nike, Inc. products during the reset. We were pleased to see comps at Champs sports improve from first half trends, especially into the month of October.', ""In fact, as Mary noted, the banner comped ahead of our internal plans last quarter. Each season, the Champs team continues to sharpen its positioning as the home of sports style, where they view sport inspired apparel, sneaker essentials and performance to serve the needs of the sport Inspired consumer. Looking ahead to the holiday quarter, we're encouraged by the early reads from recent capital light store refresh activity and are accelerating that work later in the fourth quarter. In fact, by year end, we expect over 240 of the Champs sports locations will be refreshed. We are also slightly adjusting our store closure plans for 2024. We will still close approximately 85 doors by the end-of-the year. However, we will push about 30 store closures into Q1 and Q2 next year so that we can continue to liquidate inventory and also spread some of the operational burden of those store closures over a slightly longer time period."", ""Moving to WSS. The banner saw comps down 9.4% in Q3 as the macro environment continues to weigh on that lower income consumer where WSS over indexes. During the quarter, we opened three new doors, bringing our total to 129 and are on track to open 26 net new stores for the year, or growth of approximately 20%. We're still roughly two-thirds of stores in California. We continue to see regional growth opportunities for WSS overtime. This holiday, the WSS team launched an integrated marketing campaign themed More Joy For Everyone. This is the first-ever integrated WSS campaign to include online to offline content in connection points, including several connected TV and digital spots during key customer moments. While the short-term remains challenged due to macroeconomics, we remain confident in RWS banner which is squarely positioned against the fastest growing consumer segment in America."", ""Turning to Europe. Overall comps were down 4.2%. As the macro-environment remains challenging across many parts of Europe, the team is focused on improving the in-store experience, conversion levels and inventory management. The European team is also focused on reigniting the Foot Locker brand in key markets. And like here in the U.S., we are seeing traction with our global brand campaign, our holiday assortments, as well as the store refreshes that we've completed thus far. In Asia-Pacific, comps were down slightly at a negative 0.5%. The Foot Locker banner saw comps down 1.2%, owing to the promotional marketplace dynamics and lower consumer confidence, especially in Australia. And finally, at Atmos comps were up 0.8% as the business continues to connect with sneaker enthusiast and delivers compelling innovation and brand stories from our partners."", ""Finally, we hope you saw this morning's announcement about our expansion into India in 2024. We're thrilled to be bringing our multi-brand sneaker experience to India's rapidly growing consumer class. With the help of our new partners, Metro Brands Limited and Nykaa Fashion, this new partnership will enable the renowned Foot Locker brand and striper to further expand sneaker culture, one of our core Lace Up strategies in a capital efficient manner, while also generating incremental licensing royalties. So in summary, while the environment remains dynamic, our teams continue to balance the delivery of must-have full price premium assortment this holiday, alongside strong omnichannel marketing programs, while at the same time remaining extremely vigilant about our inventory and gross margin management."", ""I'll now hand the call over to Mike to go over the financials and guidance in more detail."", 'Mike Baughn: Thank you, Frank, and good morning everyone. Now turning to third quarter results. Starting with revenue, our total sales fell by 8.6% on a comp decline of 8%, which was better than both our first half trend and our prior annual outlook of comps down 9% to 10%. As noted previously, the repositioning of Champs Sports represented a 3 point comp headwind within the quarter. By month, August comps were down high-single digits, September also was down high-single digits and October declines moderated to down mid-single digits. While traffic and conversion remain headwinds, year-over-year in the third quarter we saw steady improvements in our conversion. This was especially true in September and October as customers responded to our promotional efforts and importantly as our efforts to drive greater digital and in-store conversion took hold.', 'While we saw our launch business be less of a headwind in the third quarter versus the second quarter trend, we also saw some stabilization in our base business as customers responded to our fresh fall receipts in addition to our compelling promotions. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter declined 470 basis points to 27.3%. Merchandise margins fell by 370 basis points, with the majority of the decline, driven by higher promotions to move through inventory and to reach our price sensitive shopper. We also continue to see elevated shrink levels. Outside of merchandise margin, occupancy costs deleveraged by 100 basis points on the sales decline. Approximately $5 million of gross margin savings from our cost optimization programs helped to offset a portion of the pressure from promos, shrink, and occupancy deleverage.', ""For the third quarter, our SG&A rate came in at 22.5% representing deleverage of 100 basis points with savings from the cost optimization program of approximately $25 million more than offset by deleverage on the sales decline inflation and investments in frontline wage and technology. Collectively, our cost optimization program generated total savings of approximately $30 million in the third quarter and we still expect to capture approximately 40% of the total $350 million targeted savings within this year. Finally, non-GAAP earnings came in at $0.30, above our initial expectations as improving conversion levels, especially on digital drove a better-than-expected comp decline in addition to our cost savings measures. Moving on to our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter, given the trends we're seeing in November, we are narrowing our full year non-GAAP EPS to a range of $1.30 to $1.40 from $1.30 to $1.50 previously."", ""Our outlook now embeds in $0.11 EPS contribution in the fourth quarter from the 53rd week, down from $0.15 previously as we've refined our view and finalized our commercial planning assumptions around the extra week. With the extra week, adding approximately a 1 percentage point lift to sales, total sales for the 53rd week year are expected to fall by 8% to 8.5%. Overall, our store count will be down approximately 7% in 2023 with square footage down approximately 2% as we convert more stores to larger formats. Within the fourth quarter, our outlook embeds non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.26 to $0.36. Our outlook assumes a comp of down 7% to down 9%, note the lower end continues to contemplate macro risks this holiday season and the upper end continues to reflect ongoing positive response to our holiday assortments and the wins we're seeing from our strategic initiatives."", ""On gross margin, we expect declines of approximately 290 basis points to 310 basis points towards the range of 27.0% to 27.2%. On expenses, we expect deleverage of approximately 40 basis points to 70 basis points toward a range of 22.7% to 23.0% on the sales declines. Finally, our CapEx outlook for the year is now $275 million, down from $290 million previously due to the timing of real estate projects. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $187 million of cash and total debt of $449 million. At quarter end, our inventories were 10.5% above last year, down slightly from the 11% level at the start of the quarter. It's important to note that our inventory balance includes an approximate 6 point impact from the strategic pull forward of inventory to ensure smooth product flows ahead of the holiday season."", ""We are reaffirming our expectation to end the year with inventory flat to slightly down versus last year. In terms of shareholder distributions within the quarter, we paid $38 million in dividends and did not repurchase any stock. As we announced last quarter, our Board made the decision to pause dividends beyond the third quarter's payment to ensure financial flexibility in support of our strategic projects. We still expect to update investors around our longer-term capital allocation goals and financial targets when we report fourth quarter results early next year. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."", 'See also 25 Best Quotes From Charlie Munger and 20 Countries With The Most Religious Freedom In The World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The company’s cost-efficiency initiatives might also support bottom-line growth in the upcoming period. Yet, declining revenues due to volatile fee income is a headwind. Lower loan balance due to asset cap and declining mortgage banking income are other major drags.', 'Wells Fargo continues to build on its deposit base, which witnessed a three-year (ended 2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.5%. However, the metric declined in the first nine months of 2023 mainly due to customers allocating cash to higher-yielding alternatives. Nonetheless, the considerable strength in the consumer business and commercial banking segments will likely support the deposit balance in the upcoming period.', 'The big bank’s prudent expense management initiatives support its financials. Expenses witnessed a negative CAGR of 0.5% over the last three years (ended 2022). The declining trend continued in the first nine months of 2023. Expense reduction efforts, such as streamlining organizational structure, closing branches and reducing headcount undertaken from third-quarter 2020, have been aiding expense management. The company expects to continue with these efficiency initiatives in 2023. Such efforts are likely to support bottom-line growth.', 'As of Sep 30, 2023, Wells Fargo’s total debt (comprising long-term debt and short-term borrowings) was $283.36 billion. The company has a strong liquidity position, with a liquidity coverage ratio of 123% as of third-quarter 2023 end, which has been above its regulatory minimum of 100%. It also maintains long-term issuer investment-grade credit ratings of A+, A1 and BBB+ from Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global, respectively.', 'Thus, with a solid credit profile and liquidity position, Wells Fargo will be able to meet its near-term debt obligations, even if the economic situation worsens.', 'Given decent liquidity, the company’s capital deployment activities seem sustainable. Following the clearance of the 2023 stress test, the company increased its dividend by 16.7% to 35 cents per share in July. Also, as of the third-quarter end, it had $29 billion authorization remaining under its share repurchase plan.', 'However, revenue growth has become challenging for Wells Fargo. Revenues witnessed a negative CAGR of 3.9% over the last four years (2018-2022). Though revenues increased in the first nine months of 2023 on elevated trading activity, the same may not be replicable in the upcoming quarters. Higher funding costs are likely to impede net interest income (NII) and revenue growth. Also, volatility in fee income continues to affect the company’s top-line performance.', 'Wells Fargo has been registering declines in loans over the past few years on planned run-off from non-strategic/liquidating portfolios. With the asset cap remaining in place until it complies fully with regulators’ demands regarding compliance and operational risk management, Wells Fargo’s loan balance is not likely to improve much. This will, thereby, hamper NII growth.', 'Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking activities consist of residential and commercial mortgage originations, sales and servicing. Mortgage banking income saw a three-year (ended 2022) negative CAGR of 20.1%, with the decline continuing in the first nine months of 2023.', 'At the beginning of the year, the company announced its exit from the Correspondent business and the reduction of its mortgage servicing portfolio. This, along with high mortgage rates and low originations, is likely to affect mortgage banking income in the upcoming quarters.', 'Over the past year, WFC shares have declined 2.4% compared with the industry’s fall of 4.3%.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 2.4%."", ' See our latest analysis for McCormick ', ""Even a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. The last dividend was quite easily covered by McCormick's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 44.7%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 49%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.68 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.56. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.7% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained."", ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, things aren't all that rosy. McCormick has seen earnings per share falling at 6.7% per year over the last five years. A modest decline in earnings isn't great, and it makes it quite unlikely that the dividend will grow in the future unless that trend can be reversed. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern."", 'Overall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.', ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for McCormick that investors should take into consideration.

ISRG is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism, led by solid first-half 2023 results and its progress on the artificial intelligence (AI) front, is expected to contribute further.

These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.', 'Per management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging have enabled new solutions to old problems.

Although gross margin contracted, operating margin improved during the third quarter (as anticipated). The declining trend in operating expenses is likely to continue in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'Risk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures.

You can't take the Adobe numbers out of context and project what's going on in retail. Those are only e-commerce numbers. And most of the numbers that have quoted are just totally consistent with the year-over-year growth that e-commerce has had all along because e-commerce is taking share."", ""We're not so sure what's happening in bricks-and-mortar retailing. But from what I've heard, a lot of what we saw in growth on the internet was at the expense of bricks and mortar. So be careful. It may not be that astounding a holiday season as people are streaming record numbers on Black Friday. All of that not so clear."", ""Given that environment, I still think, you know, the winners are those that provide tremendous value. Walmart has done great. I think they're performing as well as I've ever seen them perform. Their position in the area the consumer is focused on, which is closer in necessities, groceries, things like that, they're going to continue to do fantastic."", 'Costco continues to perform at very high level. TJX, very high level, excellent company, numbers that are fantastic. And then, of course, Amazon because that internet is growing and they are clearly the best on the internet.', ""Meanwhile, retailer after retailer, the other guys, they're reporting big negative numbers. Sometimes the stock has seen a surge. Like, you know, we've seen that recently with some companies that showed higher earnings than expected."", ""But look at the sales. Best Buy negative 7, Lowe's negative 7, Nordstrom's negative 7 same store sales, Macy's negative 7, Kohl's down 6, Target down 5, Home Depot down 4. There is a lot of carnage out there on the top line for sure in retailers right now because consumer is not open up their wallet and buying like crazy."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And Simeon, when you look at your coverage universe, get you in here too, who are some of the winners and losers in retail. Looking ahead, Simeon, break it down for us. Discounters, luxury, athletic gear, what do you see?', ""SIMEON SEIGEL: Josh Lipton, you bring me back in. I'm keeping notes on the things that I wanted to catch up on. One I wanted to point out that retail is all about storytelling, so back to the turnaround story. Let's keep in mind the marketing."", ""No, so-- listen, I think that Victoria's Secret reported today, they told us that November feels up. Like, they told us that Black Friday, the weekend, was good. And that obviously is a big store business."", ""So I think that what we do, everything I've been seeing-- so I generally agree with Jerry that a lot of these numbers we have to take with grains of salt or context. But the people that I'm talking to, what we are seeing, what we're hearing, I think so far the Black Friday weekend, the holiday has gotten off to a good start. I think the biggest question is going to be less did it perform now and more what's going to happen in the lull? We've got a long time between now and Christmas."", ""So I think that's going to be this interesting dynamic of did the strength that starts, does it carry through? And when we think about what Victoria's Secret said, they did guide January and December to see a material step down. So that'll be one thing worth watching."", ""But I'm going to-- I'm going to be a little bit more I think optimistic and flag that most of consumer just reported. And from what I'm looking at a little over 50% reported revenue growth and they all saw fantastic gross margin. So I think it is a little bit more of a case by case and, kind of, Jerry went through the winners."", ""And so I think when I look through this, I'm seeing a dichotomy, but it's not as much group agnostic. I'm seeing a lot of pairings. I'm seeing companies like Athleta see revenues down and we'll see Lulu up, right? You're seeing companies like Coach up and Michael Kors down. They sell the same thing."", ""And that works with the big box as well and so that works in off price as well. You're watching Nordstrom Rack and Old Navy who have revenues down and [INAUDIBLE] be up. So I think right now we're finally in this environment where winners, people who predict their demand well, are going to continue to win and those that don't are going to lose. That's an interesting retail opportunity. And so that actually makes me a little bit more optimistic.""]"

It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Regions Financial's shares on or after the 7th of December, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 2nd of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.24 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.96 to shareholders.

Fortunately for readers, Regions Financial's earnings per share have been growing at 20% a year for the past five years."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Regions Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 37% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see."", ""Has Regions Financial got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business.

In summary, Regions Financial appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it."", ""With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

This is fueled by the travel and entertainment-related transactions, which were severely impacted by the pandemic. With declining restrictions after the pandemic, domestic and cross-border travel surged by a significant margin, signaling a robust recovery in the tourism and hospitality sectors. Revenge travel quickly gained popularity as people sought to make up for lost vacations and experiences, boosting cross-border payments of financial services providers like Visa Inc. V and Mastercard Incorporated MA.', 'Per the 2023 Visa Global Travel Intentions Study, the surge in travel post-pandemic is not showing signs of slowing down despite inflationary pressures.

On the flip side, high prices can result in a decline in consumer spending, leading to an overall reduction in payment volumes. However, so far, inflation has not slowed down the current pace of cross-border travel, positively impacting the results of companies in this space.', 'Improving travel numbers coupled with the continued adoption of electronic payments should continue to act as a boon for companies in the digital payments space. Per the 2023 McKinsey Global Payments Report, electronic or digital payments have surpassed overall payment growth, averaging at a five-year rate of 17% versus 6%.

Growth in cross-border e-commerce is also expected to boost cross-border payment volumes.', 'Cross-border payments are a high-margin business, as companies can charge an additional foreign exchange fee, thus complementing its top line. Cross border Peer to Peer transactions grew at a rate of 65% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter for Visa. Cross-border travel volume, excluding intra-Europe, year-over-year growth is expected to be near the low 20s in constant dollars in 2024 for the company.', 'Per the Visa Global Travel Intentions Study, digital wallets are an integral part of the travel journeys for 74% of travelers.

This trend is mostly seen in unbanked countries where digital wallets are gaining traction. With Visa Direct, customers do not require a card or account to receive funds in their wallet, further enhancing its value proposition and adding to the company’s cross-border revenues.', 'Cross-border travel was strong for Mastercard in the third quarter of 2023 at 155% compared with 2019 levels.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Tapestry investors that purchase the stock on or after the 7th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.35 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.40 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Tapestry has a trailing yield of 4.3% on the current share price of $32.7.

So we need to investigate whether Tapestry can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Tapestry ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Tapestry's payout ratio is modest, at just 31% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 28% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies."", ""It's positive to see that Tapestry's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Tapestry has grown its earnings rapidly, up 24% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Tapestry has lifted its dividend by approximately 1.6% a year on average. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Tapestry is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business."", ""Should investors buy Tapestry for the upcoming dividend? Tapestry has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable.

(NYSE:TRV) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Travelers Companies' shares on or after the 7th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.00 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$4.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Travelers Companies stock has a trailing yield of around 2.2% on the current share price of $181.98. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Travelers Companies ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Travelers Companies's payout ratio is modest, at just 41% of profit."", 'Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.', ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Travelers Companies earnings per share are up 5.1% per annum over the last five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Travelers Companies has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.2% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", 'Has Travelers Companies got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Travelers Companies has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. Overall, Travelers Companies looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.', ""While it's tempting to invest in Travelers Companies for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved.

They had previously announced that they were going to institute a dividend. And they did. Their cash position is much better than it was in the depths of the pandemic, when the parks were shut down. So there was no good reason for them not to go back to paying a dividend. I don't think that has anything to do with Peltz."", ""They did change some of their proxy voting rules as well.

But at the end of the day, I think he has less than 2% of the vote. I don't think shareholders, in general, while maybe some of the shine has come off of Bob Iger in his second stint, I don't think shareholders really want to see him go. And I don't think, in general, they think that Peltz has anything to add to the conversation."", ""BRAD SMITH: OK. And so of these activist campaigns, what should investors then continue to expect? What kind of wait do you think that they'll continue to give them? As Disney right now, really has just bounced off of some of those lows. And, of course, we've seen it be able to move to the upside with some of the broader market activity over the past month in November. But at the same time, it's still a ways off of where the company had been in some of its year-to-date highs."", ""DOUG CREUTZ: Yeah. Iger came back. He caught a lot of costs out of the business. And now, he's identified the need for Disney's content engines to start being successful again. They've had a very soft run at the box office post-pandemic after having had an incredibly strong run pre-pandemic."", ""Some of that's just reversion to the mean.

(NASDAQ:NDAQ) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Nasdaq's shares before the 7th of December in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 22nd of December."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.22 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.88 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Nasdaq has a trailing yield of 1.6% on the current share price of $55.9. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Nasdaq has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for Nasdaq ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Nasdaq paying out a modest 37% of its earnings."", 'When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.', ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Nasdaq, with earnings per share up 5.5% on average over the last five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Nasdaq has increased its dividend at approximately 18% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Should investors buy Nasdaq for the upcoming dividend? Nasdaq has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. In summary, Nasdaq appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it."", ""While it's tempting to invest in Nasdaq for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Nasdaq (1 doesn't sit too well with us) you should be aware of."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Moreover, PSA’s technological advancements and healthy balance sheet are commendable. Its sustainable dividend payouts make it an attractive investment option. However, weak demand in a soft macroeconomic environment, a rise in move-out activities, a development boom in many markets and elevated interest rates remain concerns.', ""Public Storage is one of the top owners and operators of storage facilities. The brand stands out as one of the most recognized and established names in the self-storage industry. With a significant market presence in major metropolitan centers, the company is poised to capitalize on the economies of scale, apart from benefiting from its brand recognition. The company is also in a good spot to benefit from its 35% stake in Shurgard Self Storage SA.In addition, Public Storage has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In September 2023, it acquired Simply Self Storage from BREIT for $2.2 billion. From the beginning of 2021 through Sep 30, 2023, the company acquired 459 facilities with 38 million net rentable square feet for $8.3 billion. Following Sep 30, 2023, the company has either acquired or was under contract to acquire 11 self-storage facilities across eight states with 0.8 million net rentable square feet for $170.3 million.For 2023, the company raised its guidance for acquisitions to $2.7 billion from $2.6 billion guided earlier while retaining its development opening projections of $375 million. It also has a pipeline of nearly $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next two years.Public Storage maintains a strong financial profile characterized by solid credit metrics, including low leverage relative to its total capitalization and operating cash flows. Its investment-grade credit ratings render it favorable access to the debt market. With solid access to capital, the company is well-poised to take advantage of any potential expansion opportunity.Public Storage’s current cash flow growth is projected at 96.40% compared with the 8.02% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. Public Storage’s ROE is 34.76% compared with the industry’s average of 3.08%.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for investment in REIT stocks. Public Storage has consistently paid its dividends and continued with its payments even during the pandemic. In February 2023, it announced an increase in its regular quarterly dividend from $2 per share to $3. This marked a hike of 50% in its dividend payment. The annualized common dividend payment now equates to $12 per share.Moreover, backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we anticipate core FFO to improve 5.6% in 2023. Looking at the company’s core FFO growth projections and financial position compared to that of the industry’s average, its current dividend is expected to be sustainable.While shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 4.2% over the past month, underperforming its industry's growth of 7.5%, analysts seem bullish regarding PSA’s FFO growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 FFO per share has been revised marginally upward over the past month."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'However, with tenants reverting to more normal move-out behavior as the pandemic’s impact abates, there is upward pressure on vacate trends. This is likely to limit rental rate growth in many markets. Management expects weaker industry-wide demand in the rest of the current year compared to the prior year amid a soft macroeconomic outlook and more limited home-moving activities, with move-out activities and occupancy levels returning to pre-2020 levels.To lure tenants in such a challenging environment, management continues to focus on lowering rental rates to new customers and increasing promotional discounting. Consequently, same-store revenues are likely to be affected, and we estimate a 3.1% decline in this metric in the fourth quarter. Also, we project the 2023 weighted average square foot occupancy to be 93.1%, down from 94.9% recorded at the end of 2022.A high interest rate is a concern for Public Storage. Elevated rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden, and its total debt as of Sep 30, 2023, was approximately $9.1 billion. For 2023, we expect interest expenses to increase 47% year over year.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Iron Mountain IRM and STAG Industrial, Inc.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase Fidelity National Information Services' shares on or after the 7th of December, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 22nd of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.52 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.08 per share.

If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend.

Heidi Capozzi, the company's Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer, sold 687 shares of McDonald's Corp on December 1, 2023. This transaction has prompted a closer look into the insider's trading behavior and its potential implications for the stock's performance."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CRM.', ""Heidi Capozzi has been serving as the Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer at McDonald's Corp. In her role, Capozzi is responsible for overseeing the company's global human resources operations, including talent management, strategic workforce planning, and leadership development. Her position places her at the heart of the company's efforts to cultivate a productive and engaged workforce, which is essential for McDonald's continued success in the highly competitive fast-food industry."", ""McDonald's Corp is a world-renowned fast-food company that operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants globally. The company's offerings include a variety of value-priced menu products in countries around the world. McDonald's operates through segments that include the United States, International Operated Markets, and International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate. With its vast network of over 38,000 restaurants in over 100 countries, McDonald's serves millions of customers daily, making it one of the largest and most recognizable fast-food chains in the world."", ""Insider trading activities, such as the recent sell by Heidi Capozzi, can provide valuable insights into a company's internal perspective on its stock's valuation and future prospects. Over the past year, Capozzi has sold a total of 2,750 shares and has not made any purchases. This could be interpreted in various ways; however, without additional context, it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the insider's sentiment towards the company's future."", ""When examining the broader insider transaction history for McDonald's Corp, there has been a noticeable trend of more insider sells than buys over the past year, with 20 insider sells and only 1 insider buy. This pattern of insider selling could suggest that those with intimate knowledge of the company see the current stock price as being relatively high or that they are taking profits after a period of stock appreciation."", ""On the day of Capozzi's recent sell, shares of McDonald's Corp were trading at $283.25, giving the company a substantial market cap of $207.42 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 25.17 is slightly higher than the industry median of 23.1 and also above the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This could indicate that the stock is somewhat overvalued compared to its peers and its own historical valuation."", ""However, the price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.97 suggests that McDonald's Corp is Fairly Valued based on its GF Value.

With a GF Value of $292.67, the stock's current price is just below this intrinsic value estimate, indicating that it may be reasonably priced."", ""The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the insider trading activities at McDonald's Corp. The predominance of selling transactions could be a signal for investors to consider, especially when combined with the company's valuation metrics."", ""The GF Value image further illustrates the stock's valuation in relation to its intrinsic value.

While the company's market cap and price-earnings ratio suggest a strong and potentially overvalued stock, the GF Value indicates that it is fairly valued. The insider trading trend, with more sells than buys, could be a point of caution for potential investors. As always, it is important for investors to conduct their own due diligence and consider multiple factors, including insider trading patterns, when making investment decisions."", ""McDonald's Corp continues to be a dominant player in the fast-food industry, and its stock remains a closely watched component of many investment portfolios.

This will enhance its product mix and encourage it to proceed with more pure-play aggregates acquisitions.Given the improving trends, the company is optimistic that the demand in its end markets is likely to accelerate upon the moderation of inflation and restrictive monetary policy.

Q2 improved on our solid start to FY 2024 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance while our operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. We remain relentlessly focused on managing the elements within our control while driving better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive results from these actions, with increased profitability and a stronger position for delivering long-term growth. In Q2, we held our INSIGHT user conference where I witnessed the tangible excitement for the silo-free innovation, our unified data storage provides.', 'It was invigorating to be with the thousands of attendees and hear stories of the extraordinary outcomes NetApp delivers for our customers. NetApp is at the forefront of the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers turn disruption into opportunity with intelligent data infrastructure. Today’s organizations need storage infrastructure that harnesses the power of public and hybrid clouds while keeping data secure and protected from ransomware attacks. They need infrastructure that supports dynamic workloads like AI, cloud-native, and open-source applications. And they need infrastructure that helps to create more sustainable data centers. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, that supports any application, any data type, and spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments.', 'This comprehensive architecture delivers unparalleled simplicity of management, simplicity of deployment, and consistency of automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. We further elevate the customer experience with our BlueXP sustainability dashboard and NetApp Advance a common set of programs and guarantees that include Storage Life Cycle program, which removes the burden of upgrade cycles as well as storage efficiency, ransomware recovery and data availability guarantees. Intelligent data infrastructure combines unified data storage, integrated data services, and intelligent operations, so customers can operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unify their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats.', 'Looking at the results of the quarter, momentum from new products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year drove 10% quarter-over-quarter growth in hybrid cloud segment revenue to $1.4 billion. Our all-flash array business benefited from the growth of the AFF C-Series increasing 14% from Q1 to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.2 billion. The AFF C-Series all-flash array continues to exceed our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. In the quarter, we successfully competed against an all-flash competitor with C-Series to win a $16 million deal at an Infrastructure-as-a-Service company. The customer was looking for new storage to host a broad variety of critical applications.', ""Our ease of management for large storage environments, unique data resilience, common toolkit across all our storage systems and the right price performance ratio secured our win despite the competitor's attempt to use price once they realize their value proposition was insufficient. ONTAP One, our all-in-one software license that gives customers access to the industry's most comprehensive data management suite has laid the groundwork to future tech refresh and expansion opportunities. Building on the success of the C-Series, we introduced blocked optimized and AI-ready visions. The ASA C-Series family is a solution tailored to deliver high-performance and guaranteed high availability storage for critical applications, databases and VMware infrastructure, coupled with capacity flash to make enterprise-grade block storage more affordable and sustainable than ever."", 'We added the AFF C-Series to the ONTAP AI architecture, lowering the overall cost of entry to scalable AI without sacrificing performance. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering is also growing rapidly. In Q2, we added performance and availability guarantees to Keystone, expanding on the existing sustainability and storage efficiency guarantees, creating a comprehensive program to keep storage operations running optimally. We also announced NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, powered by Keystone, providing customers with a single subscription to a full stack of compute, networking and storage infrastructure with low-latency interconnection to all major public clouds. Turning to Public Cloud. As we said last quarter, our priority is growing first party cloud storage services.', 'We aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners’ go-to-market structures at the start of the fiscal year and are seeing new customer additions and growth in those services. However, that growth has been masked by weakness in subscription services, which have declined to 23% of Public Cloud ARR. During the quarter, we engaged in a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio. As a result, we will continue to prioritize cloud storage offerings delivered through the hyperscalers, while refocusing some services, such as Cloud Insights and Instaclustr, to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings, creating greater differentiation and additional value for customers. We will integrate other services that are sold as standalone subscriptions today, such as data protection, into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes.', ""We will also carefully manage the transition of cloud storage subscription services to align to customer preference for consumption offerings. And, we have decided to exit the SaaS backup and virtual desktop services. We anticipate ARR headwinds of approximately $55 million from exited services and unrenewed subscriptions in the second half of fiscal year '24. Growth in first party and marketplace services are expected to partially offset this decline, positioning us to enter FY '25 with a more focused and much healthier business from which to grow. Now to the results of the quarter. Public Cloud segment revenue in Q2 was $154 million, flat from Q1 and up 8% year-over-year. Our first party and marketplace offerings are highly differentiated and are tightly aligned with customers’ buying preferences."", 'These services grew over 30% from Q2 a year ago. We continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as increases in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR in this part of the portfolio. In Q2, we extended our partnership with Google with the introduction of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. Now, we are not only the only vendor to have a natively integrated storage service in the public cloud, but we are natively integrated into all three of the leading hyperscale vendors. And we are not standing still with this advantage. Just two months after introducing the GCNV service, we announced the availability of a new lower-cost tier of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, expanding the offering to address a greater range of workloads.', 'These partnerships uniquely position and enable us to participate in the innovation and adoption of AI services in the public cloud. As examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloud’s Vertex AI with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, as well as cross-protocol, hybrid cloud AI pipelines on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with support for SageMaker Studio notebooks. Our position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A U.S.-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to replace a competitor’s SAN systems when they moved their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customer’s first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating FSxN for workload consolidation and disaster recovery.', ""Looking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY '24, despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure, and data management which enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely, and sustainably. With recent innovations that enable us to address a broader set of markets more efficiently, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. I’ll now turn the call over to Mike."", 'Mike Berry: Thank you, George and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a very solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging macro environment with soft IT spend. Our relentless focus and consistent execution delivered results that met and exceeded our guidance ranges and drove record-setting non-GAAP profitability measures across consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our modern, innovative solutions are resonating with customers and our disciplined operational management drove profitability margins to a record high. As we look ahead, we expect our industry leading solutions and unwavering focus to drive revenue growth and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year.', ""Q2 consolidated gross margins of 72% were at an all-time high, driven by product gross margin of 61%, also at an all-time high. Gross margin leverage and the returns on our strategic investments drove record operating margins of 27% and record EPS of $1.58. During the quarter, we returned approximately $403 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing share count by 4% versus Q2 '23. Over the course of the year, we expect to return at least 100% of free cash flow to stockholders. Given our growth, profitability and working capital improvements, we expect operating cash flow for the full year to normalize and track relatively in-line with net income for the full year. Due to our solid execution and operational efficiencies, we outperformed the second quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year."", ""As a result, we are raising all our guidance measures for fiscal year '24. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q2 billings of $1.5 billion decreased 9% year-over-year, and revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-over-year, as IT budgets remain constrained in a challenging macro environment. Adjusting for the FX tailwind of 160-basis-points, billings and revenue would have decreased 11% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year, and product revenue of $706 million decreased 16% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, the first half of fiscal year '23 revenue, and most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog entering fiscal year '23. For the second half of fiscal year '24 year-over-year comparisons should be more apples-to-apples."", ""Support revenue, an attach to our install base and indicative of the value of our products, grew 3% year-over-year to $623 million. We are pleased with the momentum of our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives implemented at the start of fiscal year '24. Public Cloud revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $154 million and was relatively flat from Q1 '24. As George noted, year-over-year growth was driven by hyperscaler first party and marketplace services, partially offset by continued declines in subscription services. Now, for our operating results. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 72% and product gross margin increased 1,080 basis points year-over-year to 61%. Product gross margin benefited from three main factors: Number one, a mix shift to higher margin and higher capacity products."", 'Number two, favorable COGs stemming from lower component costs and our strategic purchase agreements for NAND. Number three, price discipline in a cost sensitive, competitive pricing environment. I want to be very clear on this point: there were no unusual or one-time transactions that drove the higher product gross margin results. As we discussed in prior calls, we continue to make strategic purchase commitments to lock-in NAND pricing and mitigate margin pressure from rising prices in the future, as NAND prices largely bottomed out in Q2. Operating expenses of $706 million were flat year-over-year and grew $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Within a relatively consistent OpEx envelope, we will continue to reallocate investments to areas of higher opportunity to drive long-term growth.', 'In Q2 operating margin increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 27%, which includes 80 basis points of FX tailwind. EPS grew 7% year-over-year to $1.58, which includes a $0.07 FX tailwind. These record results demonstrate the strength of our business model, product relevance and unwavering focus and execution. As expected, Q2 operating cash flow of $135 million was impacted by seasonally lower collections and repatriation tax payments. DSO was 46 and inventory turns were 15. More importantly, year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million grew 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 8% the same period a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $97 million, bringing the year-to-date amount to $515 million, up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $403 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $230 million in net cash.', ""Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q2 was $4 billion. The slight decline year-over-year is driven by lower multi-year support and public cloud subscription billings. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. Given the success of our product portfolio and consistent execution on operational improvements, we are raising our fiscal '24 guidance in still a soft IT spending environment. We now expect fiscal year '24 revenue to be down approximately 2% year-over-year, an improvement from our previous guidance. We expect to see continued strength in product and hyper-scaler first-party and marketplace services, as we work through minor headwinds from public cloud subscription services."", 'Consolidated gross margins are expected to be approximately 71%. For the second half, we expect product gross margin to range between 58% to 60%, driven by continued mix shift to all-flash products and taking into account the current pricing environment and our commitment to maintain pricing flexibility. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 26% and EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25 with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $30 million and share count of 212 million. Operating cash flow is expected to move in-line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. In Q3, we expect revenue to range between $1.51 billion and $1.67 billion, which at the midpoint implies an increase of 4% year-over-year.', ""We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be roughly 71%, and operating margin to be approximately 28%. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74. In closing, I want to thank our customers, employees and investors once again for their steadfast commitment and investment in NetApp. I remain confident in our ability to manage the elements in our control and focus our key priorities to help customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud journeys. Our portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments, and we are committed to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A.

Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward."", 'Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.', ' Check out our latest analysis for NiSource ', ""We have to calculate the value of NiSource slightly differently to other stocks because it is a integrated utilities company. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$25.6, the company appears about fair value at a 6.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$1.1 / (6.2% – 2.2%)', '= US$27.5', ""We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NiSource as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'No major strengths identified for NI.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings declined over the past year.', 'Interest payments on debt are not well covered.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', 'Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won\'t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

Shares have added about 4.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.', ""Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Mondelez due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts."", 'Mondelez International delivered robust third-quarter 2023 results. Adjusted earnings were 82 cents per share, increasing 16.7% on a constant-currency (cc) basis. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents per share. The year-over-year upside was mainly backed by solid operating gains, reduced shares outstanding and lower interest expenses. These were somewhat offset by increased taxes, decreased benefit plan non-service income and reduced equity method investment net earnings.Net revenues advanced 16.3% year over year to $9,029 million. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,678 million. The uptick was driven by strong organic net revenue growth of 15.7% and increased sales from Clif Bar and Ricolino buyouts, somewhat negated by currency headwinds.Favorable pricing (up 11.9 percentage points or pp) and volumes (up 3.8 pp) contributed to organic net revenues. Our model suggested pricing and volume increases of 8.9% and 6.6% for the third quarter.Revenues from emerging markets increased 14% to $3,527 million while rising 19% on an organic basis. Revenues from developed markets moved up 17.8% to $5,502 million while increasing 13.4% on an organic basis. We had expected a year-over-year net revenue increase from emerging markets and developed markets of 9.7% and 13.5%, respectively.Region-wise, revenues in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East & Africa, Europe and North America increased 42.9%, 5.1%, 16.5% and 14% year over year, respectively. On an organic basis, revenues increased 35.1%, 11.9%, 15.4% and 11.4% in the abovementioned regions, respectively.The adjusted gross profit increased by $648 million at cc. The adjusted gross profit margin expanded 120 (basis points) bps to 38.6% due to pricing, an improved product mix and reduced manufacturing expenses, partly negated by escalated raw material and transportation costs.Mondelez’s adjusted operating income rose by $307 million at cc. The adjusted operating income margin expanded 60 bps to 16.7% on increased net pricing, SG&A leverage, a favorable product mix and reduced manufacturing costs stemming from productivity. These were somewhat offset by input cost inflation. Our model suggested the adjusted operating income margin to remain in line with the year-ago period at 16.1%.', 'The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,610 million, long-term debt of $16,411 million and total equity of $28,560 million. MDLZ provided $3,150 million of net cash from operating activities for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023. Adjusted free cash flow was $2,370 million for the same period. Management expects a free cash flow of more than $3.3 billion for 2023. The company returned $0.6 billion to shareholders in cash dividends and share repurchases during the reported quarter.Mondelez now expects 2023 organic net revenue growth of 14-15% compared with the growth of more than 12% projected earlier. The raised outlook takes into account the impressive year-to-date performance.Management anticipates adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth on a cc basis of more than 16%, up from more than 12% growth forecast before. Currency movements are likely to affect net revenues by nearly 4% and adjusted EPS by 15 cents in 2023.', 'How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?', 'In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.', 'VGM Scores', 'Currently, Mondelez has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.', ""Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in."", 'Outlook', 'Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's  ROE today."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:', '19% = US$5.4b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To start with, Occidental Petroleum's ROE looks acceptable. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 23%, we aren't very excited. Still, we can see that Occidental Petroleum has seen a remarkable net income growth of 27% over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this certainly also provides some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company."", ""As a next step, we compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 33% in the same period."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is OXY fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Occidental Petroleum has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 2.3%, meaning that it has the remaining 98% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Occidental Petroleum is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.', ""Besides, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 16% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Occidental Petroleum's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Strong worldwide demand for its GI and pulmonary treatment options, traction in Europe for its the next generation WATCHMAN FLX, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers. The Pain and Brain franchisees are gaining traction in the second half of 2023 banking on strong execution of core growth strategies. The 2023 guidance indicating strong growth over 2022 builds confidence in the stock. Our estimate suggests a CAGR of 8.8% in the company's revenue through 2022-2025.

Let's take a look at some trending tickers now. Fisker trimming its production guidance in order to prioritize liquidity. It's part of the list of business updates released by the auto company. So this one was interesting. Fisker in nice pop today, of course. Listen, put that in context, the stock has been hammered, Julie. But the news is that the EV startup, they're going to sharpen their focus on operation, their words. Business update we're getting here, they reduced December production to prioritize liquidity, they say, to unlock over 300 million of working capital."", 'Also, adjusting production guidance to just over 10,000 units for 2023. And they say they are in advanced stages, Julie, of discussions with several automakers for a strategic partnerships. So a nice pop today.', ""JULIE HYMAN: And one of the other things apparently they're talking about with major automakers is to sell their greenhouse gas emission credits, which is also interesting there and presumably another reason the stock went up. But to your point, I mean, the context here is really important. The stock is down more than 90% from its record high where it was in early 2021."", ""This was a dSPAC, that's how it came public through a SPAC combination. And just to remind our viewers, SPACs when they start trading start trading at 10. So that's the reference price that you can think about when you think about SPACs, although some of them go much higher and then come much lower. So Fisker, even though it's up a lot today, is trading at $1.72. So that just tells you about where we have come."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Down about 75% this year to your point. And you just pull back the chart from the record in 2021, not pretty.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yes. Let's talk about another mover today. That was Norfolk Southern. The stock getting a boost after Bank of America upgraded it to buy from neutral. The analysts are saying that progress on service and volume recapture has been happening here for the company, that carloads are trending above target, that they're doing well year-to-date, that sequential service has now been outperforming. And they, the analysts that is over at Bank of America, are going to be meeting with Norfolk Southern next week in Atlanta. And they're going to be gathering some more information at that point."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. It was interesting, the analysts saying they have shown-- the company has shown faster service gains than they expected after those two network outages, including that derailment, of course, earlier this year, Julie, in East Palestine, Ohio. The frequency of incidents has caused us increasing concern, they tell their clients, yet the speed of improvements suggests improved resiliency, they say. And they take their target to 248.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And I mean, to your point, this was a company that had a lot of troubles because of that derailment. The stock is still down about 10% year-to-date as they have sort of struggled to come back from this. But at the same time, analysts are still not entirely convinced. There are 16 buys and 15 holds. So it still looks like the folks are kind of split as to whether they can come back. But call Bank of America now in that buy camp.', ""And UiPath shares, those are skyrocketing after the company topped estimates on the top and bottom line in the third quarter. The automation software company also reporting an upbeat outlook for annual recurring revenue. And the Street really seemed to be reassured by all of these numbers here. And that's why we saw it really shoot higher here. It's had a pretty good year-to-date for the company. And analysts are saying that expectations weren't necessarily high coming into this. So that accounts for some of that outsized reaction."", ""JOSH LIPTON: You know, Evercore's Kirk Materne weighed into. And Kirk is a very smart guy, covers the enterprise, said the results are strong, upbeat outlook, says the company is executing well in what Kirk called a choppy macro environment, says the next leg higher, he told his clients, is going to depend on 2025 guidance."", ""And just looking at his rating here, he's in line on the stock. So on the sidelines, though, he did-- he did raise his target at '24."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. A couple other things I just wanted to mention here, I was just quickly looking at the short interest on the stock, which looks like it's around 10% of float, kind of high-ish. So you do wonder if there's a short squeeze element to that big outsized gain here today. And the other thing I wanted to mention is, as I said, the stock is higher year-to-date. It's about doubled."", ""But if you look at the five-year chart of this thing, it is a very different story. It is down sharply over the past five years. So this year has been a bit of a comeback story. I'm just going to quickly look up the five-year number here. Over the past five years, it's down more than 50%.""]"

Fundamentally, you really can’t get that much more relevant this “dirty” but extraordinarily compelling sector.', 'First, let’s talk numbers. According to Grand View Research, the global waste management industry reached a valuation of $1.29 billion last year. Further, experts project that by 2030, the sector will hit revenue of nearly $1.97 billion. That comes out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4%, not bad for an unsexy ecosystem.', 'Second and more importantly, the best argument for waste stocks may stem from the Law of Conservation of Mass. Put simply, in a closed system, mass is neither created nor destroyed. Rather, it transfers from one form to another. Obviously, this means someone has to deal with the mess. On that note, below are the top waste management stocks to buy.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com', 'When it comes to top waste management stocks, I’d be remiss not to mention, well, Waste Management (NYSE:WM). A self-explanatory enterprise, the company commands a massive footprint in the underlying industry. Per its public profile, its network includes 346 transfer stations, 293 active landfill disposal sites and 146 recycling plants, among other impressive statistics.', 'Now, WM offers an avenue for steady growth and modest passive income for investors concerned about market ambiguities. Looking at its financials, I must say that nothing truly remarkable pops up. Rather, the business banks on a predictable revenue stream and therefore, consistent profitability. For instance, since 2020, Waste Management has posted consecutive increases in revenue. It’s also never failed to print net income since at least 2009.', 'In turn, the enterprise offers a forward yield of 1.63%. That’s not much. However, investors have the confidence of 210 years of consecutive dividend increases.

Headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, Waste Connections across its subsidiaries features operations in the U.S. and Canada.', 'On the charts, WCN is a bit of a laggard. Since the January opener, it moved up only a bit over 1%. In contrast, WM gained over 9% during the same period. Over the trailing 52 weeks, WCN slipped more than 6%. However, that might also make it relatively a discount. While waste management stocks don’t generally feature sterling financials, WCN is above average.', 'For example, its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 11.1%. This stat beats out 61.58% of the competition. And aside from a blip in 2015, the company consistently prints net income. Also, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $156 price target, projecting 17% growth.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Arguably the riskiest idea among waste stocks on this list, Quest Resource (NASDAQ:QRHC) doesn’t initially seem so bad. In fact, it appears a stunner, at least relative to its peers. Since the beginning of the year, QRHC gained over 23% of equity value. So, why would that be risky? Well, for some folks, fears may exist about holding the bag.', 'It’s not as if meme traders are loading up the boat with top waste management stocks. Still, if things were to get spicy in this arena, QRHC would likely be the biggest beneficiary due to its small footprint. With only a market capitalization of around $145 million, its tiny compared to the multi-billion-dollar enterprises mentioned above.', 'Still, Quest – which specializes in a word-salad buffet of efficiencies and flexibilities – offers some intriguing financial stats. While the print has faded a bit recently, in the past three years, its growth rate clocked in at an impressive 31.3%.

Ms. Watkins?"", ""Kim Watkins: Thanks, Chelsea. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis."", ""We’ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sasan."", 'Sasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong first quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform across the company. Total revenue grew 15%, driven by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 18% and Consumer Group revenue growth of 25%. This was partially offset by Credit Karma revenue decline of 5%, in line with our expectations for Q1 given the macroeconomic environment. With the strong start to the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance for fiscal year 2024. Consumer Group revenue growth reflects a strong finish to the tax extension season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted consumer and business tax categories with TurboTax Live.', ""Our innovation in tax has accelerated in several areas. First, the Credit Karma platform is leveraging data and AI to deliver personalized experiences and compelling tax offers. Second, is the innovation with TurboTax Live to deliver speed and confidence to prior year assisted customers, particularly with full service, where we can get taxes done in as little as an hour using data, AI and our expert platform at scale. And third, Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistance, helping customers in key areas where confidence matters most. For example, understanding their refund or getting answers to their questions as if they're talking to an expert. We ran many experiments during the extension season, and the learnings give us confidence in our game plan to win this tax season."", ""We believe this is Intuit's most exciting era yet. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core to fueling innovation across our platform. We're delivering experiences where the hard work is done for you with a gateway to human expertise, powering our customers' prosperity and accelerating penetration of our $300 billion in TAM. The launch of Intuit Assist is the result of years of investment in data and AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform."", ""And with our GenAI operating system, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough AI experiences across the platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way. We are creating a future of done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. Intuit Assist powered by GenAI is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade. Let me share a few updates on Intuit Assist across our offerings. First, Mailchimp. We're rolling out two new GenAI experiences, designed to help our customers grow their revenue and save time."", ""These include AI-driven audience segmentation and marketing automation. I'll share more on those in just a moment. Second, TurboTax. As I shared earlier during the extension season we tested new GenAI experiences to deliver higher confidence for our DIY customers. This includes in-topic accuracy checks and personalized explanations throughout the filing process that help explain a customer's tax outcome. We're excited about rolling out these experiences this season. Third, QuickBooks. We are testing GenAI to help customers save time and run their business with complete confidence, including a digital expert that can surface business insights and allow customers to dig deeper or connect them to a human expert. For example, we're serving our proactive business insights to customers with an actionable business summary."", ""These customers are using the business summary as a launching point to learn, create reports directly using Intuit Assist and take actions to drive their business success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months and in the future, we plan to automate these actions and do the work for our customers. Fourth, Credit Karma. We're testing GenAI to help our customers find the products that are right for them in a highly personalized way. For example, based on our research, prime members spend an average of five hours online comparing credit card benefits. With our members' credit data and spending history from accounts they choose to link to Credit Karma, we can use GenAI to help members select the right credit card for them optimized based on their personal spending history."", ""This is designed to increase engagement with our members and help them improve their financial health and drive financial success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months. We are excited by Intuit Assist's early progress. It will change our relationship with customers as we move from a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that our customers rely on daily to power their prosperity. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform. Let me now highlight progress across two of our five big bets. As a reminder, our five big bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market."", ""Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid to paying a supplier. Today, easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and get paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. Total online payment volume growth was strong in the quarter at 21%. We're also making good progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow. We made our bill pay offering widely available to customers during the quarter."", ""While it's early, we are seeing mid-market customers choosing the paid subscription offering at approximately 2x the rate of non mid-market customers, indicating this paid offering is resonating with larger customers. Turning to Mailchimp. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. As I shared earlier, we're rolling out several features powered by Intuit Assist in time for peak holiday season for many of our customers. Let me highlight two of these impactful benefits designed to help our customers grow their revenue while saving time. First, AI-driven audience segmentation, which allows small businesses to target specific audiences. Many customers don't use audience segmentation today despite the fact that it can drive up to 60% lift in average order revenue or average order value over 12 months."", ""With Intuit Assist, a customer can use conversational language to more quickly build segments and use them as a part of a marketing campaign. Second, AI-powered marketing automation, which are automated workflows that help small businesses reach their customers in uniquely tailored way. Today, many of our customers don't use marketing automation because they are time consuming the setup even though they can help them drive higher revenue. With Intuit Assist, Mailchimp creates marketing automation, which can easily be turned on and e-mail content can be generated and edited. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, 800,000 of which are already in our franchise, but using a core QBO or desktop product."", ""Online mid-market customer and revenue growth remained strong and we are driving increased adoption of QuickBooks Advanced, payments and payroll, resulting in ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers with a full ecosystem of services. We are proud of our innovation and the impact that we're making on our customers' lives. We also continue to make an impact on the communities that we serve. This quarter, we launched Intuit for education, a new financial literacy program to provide Gen Z and Gen Alpha students access to Intuit products and teach some personal and small business finance skills. We also announced the first set of winners of our Coalfield Solar Fund, providing grants in [Seven-Eye] (ph) solar energy projects in coal mining communities to help build a sustainable future."", ""Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We are also delighted to be one of the only eight Fortune 500 companies named to Fortune's inaugural top 50 AI Innovators list. With that, let me now hand it over to Sandeep."", 'Sandeep Aujla: Thank you, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered very strong results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $3 billion, up 15%. GAAP operating income of $307 million versus $76 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $960 million versus $662 million last year, up 45%, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 versus $0.14 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.47 versus $1.66 last year, up 49%. I am pleased with our early momentum this fiscal year. Turning to the business segment. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem, which grew 20%. Our results demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which continue to resonate with customers as they look to grow their businesses and improve cash flow in any economic environment.', 'with the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within a Small Business and Self-employed group is threefold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online’s accounting revenue grew 19% in Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q1, driven primarily by Payroll, Mailchimp, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting the payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. In Mailchimp, revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth.', 'And within Payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on a localized product and lineup approach. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16%. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the first quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high single digits. We are more than two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model.', 'In conjunction with our business model transition, we also raised prices across multiple desktop products in October, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem to revenue growth this year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue innovating across our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be a growth catalyst longer term. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $405 million in Q1, down 5% year-over-year. We saw partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards during Q1.', 'We -- This performance was consistent with our expectations and a prudent approach to guidance given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. On a product basis, the decline in Q1 was driven primarily by macroeconomic trends across personal loan, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma money. Shifting to the consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $187 million and grew 25% in the quarter and ProTax revenue was $42 million and grew 24%. During the quarter, we saw stronger-than-expected TurboTax return volume from states, both with and without extended tax deadlines and strong performance in share of total returns during extension season. As Sasan shared earlier, we are excited about our innovation across TurboTax.', 'The multiple experiments we ran during the extension season, bolster our confidence in our game plan to win this coming tax season. Now let me briefly touch on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions that remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and $5.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. In September, we raised $4 billion in secured -- sorry, in senior notes to repay the outstanding balance on an unsecured term loan. These notes carry a weighted average coupon of 5.29%, approximately 1 point lower than the term loan rate at the end of Q4. As a reminder, during Q1, we made tax payments of approximately $710 million that were deferred from fiscal 2023 due to the IRS disaster area tax relief.', ""We also repurchased $603 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. And lastly, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on January 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I stated earlier, I'm pleased with the early momentum we're seeing in fiscal 2024, highlighting the strength of our platform within the uncertain macroeconomic environment that is consistent with our expectations. We have a proven playbook and a track record of managing for the short and the long term, including controlling discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in an even greater position of strength."", ""Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.31. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan."", ""Sasan Goodarzi: All right. Well, thank you, Sandeep. And to wrap it up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress across our five big bets and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe this will change our relationship with customers, becoming their trusted adviser, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate at penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. With all of that said, let's now open it up to your questions."", 'Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.

Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$736.1m', 'US$882.0m', 'US$850.0m', 'US$835.4m', 'US$831.0m', 'US$833.4m', 'US$840.6m', 'US$851.4m', 'US$864.6m', 'US$879.8m', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ -1.72%', 'Est @ -0.53%', 'Est @ 0.29%', 'Est @ 0.87%', 'Est @ 1.28%', 'Est @ 1.56%', 'Est @ 1.76%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 12% ', 'US$656', 'US$700', 'US$601', 'US$527', 'US$467', 'US$417', 'US$375', 'US$338', 'US$306', 'US$278', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.7b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 12%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$880m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (12%– 2.2%) = US$9.0b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$9.0b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$2.8b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$7.5b.

Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Whirlpool as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Debt is well covered by earnings.', 'Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.', 'Weakness', 'No major weaknesses identified for WHR.', 'Opportunity', 'Expected to breakeven next year.', 'Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.', 'Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Dividends are not covered by cash flow.', ""Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with VMC.', ""David Clement serves as a Senior Vice President at Vulcan Materials Co, a major player in the construction materials industry. Clement's role within the company involves overseeing various aspects of the company's operations and strategy.

The company also produces asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Vulcan's products are essential for infrastructure and residential and nonresidential construction projects. With a strong presence in the United States, Vulcan Materials Co has a reputation for quality and sustainability in its operations."", ""Insider trading activities, such as the recent sale by David Clement, can provide valuable clues about a company's internal dynamics and future prospects. Over the past year, Clement has sold a total of 5,917 shares and has not made any purchases. This pattern of selling without corresponding buys could suggest that insiders might perceive the stock's current price as being on the higher side of its value spectrum."", ""However, it is essential to consider these transactions in the broader context of overall insider trends. Vulcan Materials Co has seen 0 insider buys and 7 insider sells over the past year. This trend of more insider selling than buying could indicate that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company's workings are taking profits or reallocating their investments, which might be a signal for investors to watch the stock closely."", ""On the day of Clement's recent sale, Vulcan Materials Co's shares were trading at $212, giving the company a market cap of $28.376 billion.

While insider sells can sometimes signal a lack of confidence in the company's future growth, they can also be motivated by personal financial planning or diversification needs. Therefore, investors should not rely solely on insider trading patterns but should also consider the company's fundamentals, industry trends, and broader market conditions."", 'The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the insider trading activities at Vulcan Materials Co. The image can help investors discern patterns and frequencies of insider transactions, which can be a useful tool in conjunction with other forms of analysis.', ""The GF Value image offers a snapshot of Vulcan Materials Co's valuation according to the GuruFocus model. This model provides a benchmark for investors to compare the current stock price with an estimated intrinsic value, helping to determine whether the stock is undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued."", ""David Clement's recent sale of 764 shares of Vulcan Materials Co is a transaction that warrants attention from the investment community. While the insider's selling activities over the past year have been consistent, it is important to analyze these actions within the broader context of the company's valuation, industry performance, and overall market trends. Vulcan Materials Co's current valuation suggests that the stock is fairly valued, and investors should continue to monitor insider activities and other key financial metrics to make informed investment decisions."", ""As always, insider trading is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to evaluating a stock's potential. It is essential for investors to conduct thorough due diligence, considering both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the company in question. Vulcan Materials Co's role as a significant supplier of construction materials positions it as a key beneficiary of infrastructure development and construction growth, factors that should be taken into account when assessing the company's future prospects."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(NASDAQ:ADP) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Automatic Data Processing's shares before the 7th of December in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.40 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.60 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Automatic Data Processing has a trailing yield of approximately 2.4% on its current stock price of $232.94. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Automatic Data Processing can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing ', 'If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Automatic Data Processing paid out 59% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (61%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Automatic Data Processing's earnings per share have been growing at 15% a year for the past five years. Automatic Data Processing is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Automatic Data Processing has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see."", ""Has Automatic Data Processing got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. That's why we're glad to see Automatic Data Processing's earnings per share growing, although as we saw, the company is paying out more than half of its earnings and cashflow - 59% and 61% respectively. All things considered, we are not particularly enthused about Automatic Data Processing from a dividend perspective."", ""On that note, you'll want to research what risks Automatic Data Processing is facing. For example - Automatic Data Processing has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

346,769ccbb6-22c9-3289-a504-6e36944aeca8,VNO,2023-12-02,Vornado (VNO) Surges 61% in 6 Months: Will the Trend Last?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vornado-vno-surges-61-6-150400191.html,1701443040,STORY,['VNO'],"['Shares of Vornado Realty Trust VNO have soared 60.7% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 0.2%.Although the overall demand for office real estate seems to be under pressure due to macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment, select markets are bucking the negative trend.Net absorption in the United States office market showed signs of improvement in the third quarter of 2023 compared with the first and second quarters. The growing preference for premier office spaces with class-apart amenities by tenants has played a key role in aiding absorption rates.Vornado’s ability to offer such properties in a few select high-rent, high-barrier-to-entry regional markets in the United States is likely to have helped it benefit from this positive trend, driving the increased optimism in its stock price.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""Apart from its significant presence in New York City office and Manhattan street retail, the company has a controlling interest in 555 California Street, in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District and owns theMART in Chicago's River North District, which are iconic office assets in signature cities.With the resumption of economic activity in full swing, employees are returning to offices or announcing plans to come back. This is supporting the office real estate market fundamentals.In the third quarter, Vornado noted that leasing velocity remained steady, concentrated mainly in small to medium-sized leases. In the New York office portfolio, the company leased 236,000 square feet of office space (190,000 square feet at share) for an initial rent of $93.33 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 7.9 years in the quarter.More so, the next cycle of office-space demand will likely be driven by the combination of office-using job growth, higher space utilization and expansion of technology, financial and media companies. Office occupiers are keen on growing their office footprint in New York City. Rents in the newly constructed or best-in-class redeveloped assets, which offer abundant amenities at transit-centric locations, have risen.Given Vornado’s ability to offer top-quality office spaces in this market and a healthy leasing pipeline of 1.8 million square feet as of the end of the third quarter, it is well-placed to benefit from the emerging trend.Vornado, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), enjoys a diversified tenant base, which includes several industry bellwethers. This enables the company to generate stable cash flows and fuels long-term growth.Vornado’s portfolio-repositioning efforts aimed at improving its core business are likely to pay off well. Strategic sell-outs provide the company with the dry powder to reinvest in opportunistic developments and redevelopments and enhance overall portfolio quality.As part of such efforts, in August 2023, it closed the sale of four Manhattan retail properties — 510 Fifth Avenue, 148–150 Spring Street, 443 Broadway and 692 Broadway — for $100 million and realized net proceeds of $95.5 million. In July 2023, it disposed of The Armory Show in New York for $24.4 million.Vornado enjoys solid balance sheet strength. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had $3.2 billion of liquidity, consisting of $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and $1.9 billion available under its $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.The REIT has secured loan refinancing in recent times, enabling it to reduce interest rates on borrowings and extend debt maturities. A flexible financial position will allow it to take advantage of future investment opportunities and fund its development projects.Additionally, VNO’s current cash flow growth is projected at 21.03% compared with 8.02% growth estimated for the industry.Nonetheless, Vornado faces competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants. This may limit VNO’s ability to increase rents and/or backfill tenant move-outs and vacancies, slowing down its growth tempo.The continuation of work-from-home, flexible or hybrid work setups is likely to affect the demand for office spaces and hurt Vornado’s business prospects.Further, given the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rate environment, the company may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side."", 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are EastGroup Properties EGP, Stag Industrial STAG and Park Hotels & Resorts PK, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""We can see that Aflac does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time.

In October 2023, the company acquired Somerville Sewer System for $7 million, which added nearly 3,800 customers to its existing base.', 'The aging of water and wastewater infrastructure and delays in essential upgrades are concerns for the industry. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers, nearly 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 wastewater treatment systems in the United States are presently providing water solutions to customers. Some of the service providers are too small and have limited financial strength to carry out the essential, costly repairs on time, which leads to pipeline breakage and disruption of services and increases the possibility of contamination.Fragmentation in the water and wastewater industry is a headwind. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small players to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investments required to upgrade old and acquired assets. Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an investment of nearly $744 billion is necessary to maintain and expand water and wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years.American Water Works, through its subsidiaries, is making systematic acquisitions and taking essential steps to upgrade the old infrastructure of its acquired assets.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Union Pacific's shares before the 7th of December in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.20 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Union Pacific has a trailing yield of approximately 2.2% on its current stock price of $231.37. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Union Pacific can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see Union Pacific paying out a modest 50% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Union Pacific generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 67% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""It's positive to see that Union Pacific's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's not ideal to see Union Pacific's earnings per share have been shrinking at 4.9% a year over the previous five years."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Union Pacific has delivered an average of 14% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments."", ""Should investors buy Union Pacific for the upcoming dividend? Its earnings per share have been declining meaningfully, although it is paying out less than half its income and more than half its cash flow as dividends. Neither payout ratio appears an immediate concern, but we're concerned about the earnings. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects."", ""If you want to look further into Union Pacific, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces. For example - Union Pacific has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

(AP) — The head of the union that represents track maintenance workers says Union Pacific is jeopardizing safety by delaying nearly 1,200 planned projects until next year and laying off more than 1,000 workers, but the railroad says the seasonal move shouldn't be alarming."", ""The president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union has been sending letters to regulators for more than a month raising concerns about the layoffs, but the the Surface Transportation Board hasn't intervened."", '“Chaos and disruption with Union Pacific’s Maintenance of Way forces can only lead to one outcome — deferred maintenance and catastrophic outcomes,” Tony Cardwell, who leads the union, said in his letters. “These furloughs will affect the safety of Union Pacific operations and pose serious safety risks for the general public and the communities surrounding Union Pacific’s infrastructure.”', ""Union Pacific said the decision to delay these projects is a reflection of the fact that the railroad went over budget after dealing with several unexpected weather events like the tropical storm that hit California this year and last summer's extreme heat. The railroad said it remains committed to safety and improving its track network across the western U.S."", 'Railroad safety has been a concern nationwide this year ever since a Norfolk Southern train derailed, spilled hazardous chemicals and caught fire in eastern Ohio in February. Members of Congress proposed reforms but those have largely stalled.', 'Cardwell said that after these layoffs of 1,350 workers UP will have only a little over 4,700 track maintenance workers. Back in 2015 before a series of cuts designed to make the railroad more efficient, Union Pacific employed 8,791. That means each maintenance worker will now have about 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) of track to take care of on average, up from 8.6 last year and 6.5 in 2016.', ""The union is concerned that these cuts are an indication of how tightly new CEO Jim Vena plans to manage the railroad's expenses. Union Pacific, like all the major freight railroads, already made significant cuts in its workforce over the past several years as part of overhauling its operations to rely more on fewer, longer trains. Last month, Union Pacific announced plans to trim the ranks of its mangers across the railroad to help streamline decision making."", ""Union Pacific hasn't done large year-end layoffs of maintenance workers like this in several years, according to the union, although these jobs were originally listed as seasonal positions."", 'Union Pacific spokeswoman Clarissa Beyah said the actual number of furloughs will be smaller than the union fears because many workers take other jobs with the railroad and some workers may have enough vacation time saved up to cover the period.', '“Accusations that Union Pacific does not invest in its infrastructure and maintenance are untrue,"" Beyah said. ""This year alone, the railroad will spend $3.7 billion on capital investment, of which a significant portion is allotted for maintenance. As part of the capital planning process, we are temporarily reducing some seasonal track maintenance positions.”', 'The railroad said its workers have already replaced more than 3 million railroad ties and more than 400 miles of track across the railroad this year.', 'And even though these maintenance workers will be out of work during the holiday season, Union Pacific said it continues to hire train crews in certain locations as part of its effort to improve service and make sure it can handle all the shipments companies hire the railroad to deliver. At last report, Union Pacific had more than 33,000 employees in October before these layoffs began.', ""The union has been told that maintenance workers will be called back to work sometime in January after the railroad finalizes its capital spending budget for next year, but it's not clear exactly when that will happen or how many workers will regain their jobs. Cardwell said anytime there are layoffs some jobs are always lost permanently because not everyone is rehired.""]"

Gap Inc's business model focuses on offering a variety of high-quality merchandise at accessible price points, catering to a diverse customer base across different geographies and demographics."", ""Insider transactions, particularly those involving buying and selling of a company's stock by its executives, are often considered a barometer of the company's internal perspective on its valuation and future performance. In the case of Gap Inc, the insider transaction history reveals a pattern of more selling than buying over the past year. Specifically, there have been 0 insider buys and 14 insider sells, which could signal a lack of confidence among insiders about the company's future growth or valuation."", ""Julie Gruber's recent sale of 30,865 shares is part of this trend and could be interpreted in several ways. It might suggest that the insider believes the stock is currently overvalued or that they anticipate some headwinds for the company that could affect its stock price. However, it's also important to consider that insiders may sell shares for personal reasons that do not necessarily reflect their outlook on the company's future, such as diversifying their investment portfolio or financing personal expenditures."", ""On the day of Gruber's sale, Gap Inc's shares were trading at $19.16, giving the company a market cap of $7.442 billion.

A consistent pattern of insider selling might suggest that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company's workings are choosing to reduce their stake, possibly anticipating a downturn or believing that the stock's growth potential is limited."", ""The GF Value image provides a visual representation of Gap Inc's stock price in relation to its estimated intrinsic value. The current market price's significant deviation above the GF Value line indicates that the stock might be overpriced, which could be a contributing factor to the insider's decision to sell."", ""Julie Gruber's sale of 30,865 shares of Gap Inc is a notable insider transaction that warrants attention from investors. While insider selling can be influenced by various factors, the combination of a high price-earnings ratio, a significant price-to-GF-Value ratio, and a trend of insider selling over the past year may suggest that the stock is currently overvalued. Investors should consider these signals in the context of their own research and investment strategy when evaluating Gap Inc's stock.
