0,541c1cc8-370b-36eb-8da1-abe78f37f5b0,SCHW,2023-06-26,Should Schwab 1000 Index ETF (SCHK) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-1000-index-etf-schk-102009019.html,1687774809,STORY,"['SCHW', '^GSPC']","[Launched on 10/11/2017, the Schwab 1000 Index ETF (SCHK) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $2.79 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.05%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.46%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 27.70% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.48% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 24.86% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHK seeks to match the performance of the Schwab 1000 Index before fees and expenses. The Schwab 1000 Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that includes the 1,000 largest stocks of publicly traded companies in the United States, with size being determined by market capitalization. The index is designed to be a measure of the performance of large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks.Story continuesThe ETF return is roughly 13.91% so far this year and was up about 15.89% in the last one year (as of 06/26/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $34.56 and $42.72.The ETF has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 18.74% for the trailing three-year period. With about 991 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab 1000 Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHK is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $327.18 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $404.94 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

4,e9293e6a-51cb-3e26-8db7-32d525adabb8,O,2023-06-26,MORNING BID AMERICAS-World markets calm after Russia drama,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-americas-world-markets-100013451.html,1687773613,STORY,"['GC=F', 'KW=F', 'CL=F']","[A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.More perplexed by events than anything else, world markets stayed relatively calm on Monday after a dramatic Russian military mutiny at the weekend was uneasily quelled.Fractious geopolitics have been front of mind for global investors ever since the pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine early last year. But the fleeting risk of civil war and a toppling of Russian President Vladimir Putin revealed greater instability in the nuclear power than many had assumed.The quick truce to avert Progozhin's mercenary mutineers entering Moscow on Saturday left even seasoned Kremlinoligists scratching their heads. An eerie calm held in Moscow on Monday.For markets, the threat of a power vacuum in a nuclear military power holds obvious risks - but the most extreme of which are near impossible to price and hence most asset managers hold and wait. Without more information, rock-bottom volatility measures and the dollar edged higher - though remained contained in recent holding patterns.Looked through an energy or commodity price lens, Russian oil, gas and many of its commodities are already either cut off from western markets or under some form of sanction - and so supply threats pack less of a price punch.The different scenarios tested could just as easily see regime change in Moscow eventually returning commodity supplies to markets and cutting prices - a potential positive for inflation and interest rates dogging world assets.Aside from the VIX, which popped from pre-pandemic lows to its highest in 10 days just under 15, there was a mildly negative tilt to stocks - which were already on the back foot from downbeat June global business surveys last week.Shanghai stocks underperformed with losses of more than 1%. The offshore yuan - now down almost 5% in just six weeks - fell to another 2023 low on Monday.MORE SUBDUEDEuropean stocks and Wall Street futures were more subdued, and modestly in the red. Shares of major European defence firms Leonardo, Saab and Rheinmetall dropped between 5% and 6%.Story continuesBrent crude oil prices were actually lower on Monday, and still down almost 35% year-on-year. Gold was lower too, but wheat prices rose about 2%.For Russian markets themselves, the rouble slipped to 15-month lows - but it too had been falling last week as oil prices ebbed. Largely now isolated from western investment, Russian stocks fell about 1%.Away from the Russian drama, the week ahead focuses on the latest inflation updates from Europe and the United States, with the results of U.S. bank stress tests on Wednesday a marker after the March regional bank failures.The fallout from last week's dour business readouts was that European firms were struggling more than U.S. counterparts this month. Germany's Ifo survey bore that out on Monday.U.S. Treasury yields slipped lower, perhaps with a smidgen of a safety bid from the weekend events helping too. Two-year Treasury yields dipped briefly below 4.70% - some 10 basis points below last week's peaks - ahead of an auction of new paper later on Monday.The world's central bank umbrella body, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), called on Sunday for more interest rate hikes, warning the world economy was now at a crucial point as countries struggle to rein in inflation.Turkey's lira slid again to record lows after the central bank took steps to simplify rules governing lenders' holdings and foreign deposits after a sharp but underwhelming interest rate rise last week.In banking, HSBC has decided to leave its longstanding headquarters in Canary Wharf in east London in favour of a move to a much smaller office in the centre of the city.Events to watch for later on Monday: * Dallas Federal Reserve's June manufacturing survey * U.S. Treasury auctions 2-year notes, 3- and 6-month bills * European Central Bank Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal * Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic, St Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester all speak(By Mike Dolan, editing by Ed Osmond mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

5,e9325b40-01f0-3a53-b16e-f2504e25fab1,O,2023-06-26,Oil price gains fade but gas and wheat rise after weekend of turmoil in Russia,CNN Business,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e9325b40-01f0-3a53-b16e-f2504e25fab1/oil-price-gains-fade-but-gas.html,1687772853,STORY,"['KW=F', 'NG=F', 'CL=F']","[Oil and natural gas prices climbed Monday, while wheat prices briefly spiked higher, as investors reacted to the weekend’s brief and chaotic insurrection in Russia.Markets were largely focused on whether the turmoil in Moscow could disrupt global commodity supplies. Russia is the world’s second biggest exporter of oil, and the world’s biggest exporter of wheat.US crude oil futures briefly climbed 1.3%, before trading up 0.8% by 12.15 p.m. ET. Brent crude, the international benchmark, gained 0.7%. Both contracts lost nearly 4% last week.“Given that the short-lived event this weekend in Russia appears to have ended, we do not expect to see such a significant increase in oil prices,” analysts at Rystad Energy wrote in a note.“We do, however, believe that the geopolitical risk amid internal instability in Russia has increased. As such, we are likely to see a marginal uptick in oil prices in the coming days if the situation does not deteriorate further.”Benchmark prices for European natural gas were up 10% from Friday’s close to trade at €36 ($39) per megawatt hour. Prices have shot up over the past few weeks, mostly because of outages at some Norwegian gas plants. News that a Dutch gas field will close permanently in October has also boosted prices.Russia’s gas exports to Europe have fallen sharply since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but it still supplied 15% of EU demand last year.Chicago wheat futures gained more than 2% in early trade before slipping back. Russia’s wheat exports are forecast to hit a record 45 million tons this year, putting it well ahead of the next biggest exporter, the European Union, according to the US Department of Agriculture.Russia glimpsed the threat of armed insurrection over the weekend, with Wagner Group mercenaries marching toward Moscow as President Vladimir Putin vowed retribution, before a sudden deal seemed to defuse the crisis as quickly as it had emerged.Although the immediate risk of bloodshed appears to have dissipated, much remains uncertain. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the insurrection shows “cracks” in Putin’s role as a leader of the country.Story continues“The potential risks to watch may be on any renewed opposition from the Russian public to Putin’s leadership,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market analyst at IG Group.Signs that global energy demand could weaken as economies slow have pushed US crude prices down by nearly 14% so far this year to just under $70 a barrel. The international benchmark, Brent crude, is down by a similar margin.But anything that could jeopardize Russia’s ability to keep supplying global energy markets will be watched anxiously by policymakers in the West and by the country’s biggest customers in Asia.Stocks slip, ruble slidesReacting to the short-lived Wagner insurrection, the Russian ruble opened at its lowest level in nearly 15 months. It last traded down about 1% at 84.4 per US dollar.Asian stock markets were choppy on Monday.Japan’s Nikkei 225  (N225) opened lower and closed down 0.3%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng  (HSI) Index also lost 0.5% in a seesaw session. China’s Shanghai Composite declined 1.5%, and Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 lost 0.3%.European stocks slipped by 0.1%.“The weekend developments in Russia increase the potential uncertainty over coming days but seem to have limited market impact at the open,” analysts at Jeffries said in a morning note.Last Friday, global markets fell broadly as investors became increasingly worried that more interest rate hikes by central banks would tip major economies into a prolonged recession.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last Wednesday that further rises in interest rates were likely necessary this year to bring US inflation down to the central bank’s 2% target.This was followed by a sharper-than-expected hike in UK borrowing costs by the Bank of England Thursday, which opted for an increase of half a percentage point after data earlier this week revealed surprisingly stubborn inflation.And then on Friday, data showed that Japanese inflation excluding fresh food and energy costs hit a 42-year high of 4.3%, fueling speculation the Bank of Japan might rethink its loose monetary policy and start tightening.— Anna Cooban contributed to this article.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com]"

Nationally, rent prices increased $3 from last month, but were down $38 from the July 2022 peak. Realtor.com®'s 2023 Forecast Update predicts that rents will continue to drop, averaging -0.9% from 2022.""In May, we saw the first year-over-year decline in rents, a sea-change from the double-digit growth that renters contended with in much of 2021 and 2022. This is yet another sign that rental-driven inflation is likely behind us, even though we may not see this trend in official measures until next year,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Although still modest, a decline in rents combined with cooling inflation and a still-strong job market is definitely welcome news for households.""While rental declines are a positive sign for household affordability, it is important to note that rents are still $344 (+24.7%) higher than the same time in 2019, before the pandemic began.""Despite the decline in typical asking rents, households who may not have moved in several years are likely to see their rent increase if they're looking for a new home,"" said Hale.Western markets seeing biggest rent dropsRent prices in the expensive West are seeing the largest year-over-year declines (-3.0%), with the South close behind (-1.0%). More affordable Midwestern markets continued to increase (4.5%), but at a much slower pace than in previous months. Rents in the Northeast have stayed relatively strong, as low unemployment rates and relatively slow new construction improvements have kept demand high and supply limited. Densely populated markets like New York City (+6.8%) and Boston (+3.3%) have shown resilience.Story continuesExpectations for the second half of 2023In some good news for renters, Realtor.com® anticipates that rents will continue to drop, averaging -0.9% year-over-year in 2023. Strong multi-family new construction has helped to improve the availability of units, which is helping to improve prices. This, combined with a number of renters choosing to stay in their units longer in order to save money, will help to reduce rental market competition through the end of the year.""Looking forward, we expect to see a continued, albeit small, year-over-year decline in rental prices throughout the remainder of the year. Renters may find themselves with more bargaining power and may have better luck finding an affordable unit this year. Meanwhile, landlords looking for help setting rents in a shifting market can find tools from Realtor.com®'s Avail,"" said Hale.Rental Data – 50 Largest Metropolitan Areas – May 2023 MetroMedian Rent 0-2 bedroomYOY 0-2 bedroomAtlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Ga.$1,660-3.1 %Austin-Round Rock, Texas$1,641-5.6 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Md.$1,8502.0 %Birmingham-Hoover, Ala.$1,2613.1 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H.$2,8323.3 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.NANACharlotte-Concord-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.$1,576-3.5 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Ill.-Ind.-Wisc.$1,714-1.0 %Cincinnati, Ohio-Ky-Ind.$1,2187.5 %Cleveland-Elyria, Ohio$1,215-1.0 %Columbus, Ohio$1,3299.3 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas$1,542-3.6 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.$1,969-3.0 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Mich.$1,3235.1 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.NANAHouston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas$1,4342.0 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind.$1,3317.3 %Jacksonville, Fla.$1,5592.3 %Kansas City, Mo.-Kan.$1,3083.1 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev.$1,531-6.0 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif.$2,833-2.6 %Louisville/Jefferson County, Ky.-Ind.$1,2107.2 %Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark.$1,3250.2 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla.$2,341-2.3 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, Wisc.$1,5976.2 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wisc.$1,5111.2 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, Tenn.$1,618-0.7 %New Orleans-Metairie, La.NANANew York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Penn.$2,9116.8 %Oklahoma City, Okla.$9974.6 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla.$1,769-2.3 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-Md.$1,8231.3 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.$1,663-5.7 %Pittsburgh, Penn.$1,4503.8 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Ore.-Wash.$1,680-1.3 %Providence-Warwick, R.I.-Mass.NANARaleigh, N.C.$1,558-2.9 %Richmond, Va.$1,4484.9 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.$2,302-5.9 %Rochester, N.Y.NANASacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, Calif.$1,847-3.5 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas$1,2760.2 %San Diego-Carlsbad, Calif.$2,966-0.6 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif.$2,844-4.0 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif.$3,3471.0 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Wash.$2,112-1.8 %St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.$1,3277.7 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.$1,793-4.0 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.$1,436-1.6 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, D.C.-Va.-Md.-W.V.$2,2144.0 % Methodology Rental data as of May 2023 for studio, 1-bedroom, or 2-bedroom units advertised as for-rent on Realtor.com®. Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). We use rental sources that reliably report data each month within the top 50 largest metropolitan areas. Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.With the release of its May rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. The new methodology is expected to yield a cleaner, more representative and more consistent measurement of rental listings and trends at both the national and local level. The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since May 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Goldman Sachs Funds, and has been able to amass over $706.36 million, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Buy. Value investing is an investment strategy that involves identifying undervalued stocks in the stock market. It was popularized by Benjamin Graham, often referred to as the ""father of value investing"" and mentor to Warren Buffett. The main principle of value investing is to focus on the intrinsic value of a company rather than its market price. The strategy often entails a long-term perspective, as the market may take time to adjust to the true value of the stock. Historically, value investing has proven its efficacy in the long run, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as we mentioned in our article on 12 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy.The debate between growth and value stocks as the best picks for investment is a long-standing discussion, as both of them have given varied performances historically. During periods of economic expansion and optimism, growth stocks tend to outperform, while value stocks may shine during economic downturns or market corrections. Last year, when inflation was at its peak, value stocks declined by 7% globally, whereas growth equities saw a 28.6% drop. Moreover, value stocks in the US exhibited their strongest outperformance since the dot-com crash in 2000.Also read: 10 Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are BuyingThe AI frenzy has brought growth stocks into the limelight all over again this year. In May, the Russell 1000 Value Index experienced a 4% decline, while its growth counterpart recorded a similar-sized gain. To maximize returns, analysts advise including both value and growth stocks in one's portfolio. Wall Street Journal has highlighted that the average annualized five-year returns since 1984 have been similar for both types of stocks. However, there have been significant differences in returns over extended periods.Story continuesInvestors often solely consider only growth or value strategy at a time. In this regard, large-cap stocks attract more attention from value investors due to their higher visibility and liquidity. Moreover, larger companies may be more closely followed by analysts, making it easier for investors to evaluate their intrinsic value. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index, a stock market index that represents the performance of large-cap value stocks in the US, gained 5.45% in the past 12 months. The index tracks some of the best value stocks in the large-cap space, such as The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the largest and lowest cost U.S. exploration and production companies in the country, led by CEO Ryan Lance—in our view one of the best value creators in the industry. ConocoPhillips’s share prices fell in the first quarter as oil prices receded, which is not atypical. We were buying the company at prices where it could generate its entire market cap in free cash flow over the next decade while growing the production such that at the end of that time, the base of production would be one-third higher. This sort of reinvestment opportunity is unique to ConocoPhillips and clearly not reflected in the current share price.”7. Pfizer Inc.

It’s Me, Margaret” is now available on video on demand — perfect for summer sleepovers or mother-daughter movie nights at home. Directed by Kelly Fremon Craig (“The Edge of Seventeen”), Abby Ryder Fortson plays the 11-year-old narrator who is navigating a move to the suburbs, new friends, puberty, periods, first crushes and her faith. It is sweet, playful and reverential to its source material, which is hardly a requirement for enjoying the film. Like the book, it's set in the early 1970s, because Blume did not want the characters to be texting. Rachel McAdams is also a standout as Margaret’s mother. It could make for a great double feature with the documentary “Judy Blume Forever,” which is available on Prime Video.— Netflix also has a new film perfect for the tween set in the animated “Nimona,” inspired by ND Stevenson’s graphic novel about a shapeshifting girl. Chloë Grace Moretz voices Nimona, a rebellious outsider with riot-grrrrl energy who lives in the shadows of a futuristic kingdom with medieval touches. She teams up with a disgraced knight, Ballister (Riz Ahmed), who is on the run after being accused of killing the queen. The film is vibrant and clever, with a fun soundtrack and LGBTQ+ themes that aren’t clumsily handled. “Nimona” starts streaming on Friday.Story continues— Now out on Netflix is “Run Rabbit Run,” a horror starring “Succession’s” Sarah Snook as the single mother of a young girl who says she has memories of another life. As if Shiv isn’t enough of a sell, Snook also gets to use her native Australian accent.— AP Film Writer Lindsey BahrNEW MUSIC TO STREAM— Fans of The Weeknd get a new album, thanks to the TV show “The Idol.” He plays a scheming Svengali in the Sam Levinson-directed HBO series, which has produced the awesome “Popular” with Playboi Carti and Madonna. “The Idol, Vol. 1” includes contributions from Suzanna Son, Moses Sumney, Mike Dean, Ramsey, Jennie Kim and Lily Rose-Depp, who fills the role of pop phenom Jocelyn and sings “World Class Sinner/I’m a Freak.” Still need a reason? Check out “Double Fantasy” featuring Future — and you’ll be hooked, even if, as The Weeknd sings, it’s wrong.— Counting Lucinda Williams out is a foolhardy option — always, but especially this week. The country star is back with “Stories From a Rock n Roll Heart,” despite suffering a stroke in 2021 that partially impaired some of her motor skills and took away her ability to play guitar. On the album, Williams pays tribute to rock legends Tom Petty (“Stolen Moments”) and Replacements’ co-founder Bob Stinson (“Hum’s Liquor”), to whom she dedicates the album. The single “New York Comeback” has Patti Scialfa and Bruce Springsteen on backing vocals.— Charlie Watts is celebrated in a posthumous album of jazz recordings by the Rolling Stones drummer. “Anthology” spans 20 years of songs, including a live version of “Swindon Swing” from 1978, “Take the ‘A’ Train"" from 2001 and ”Lover Man” live in Birmingham in 1991. Some of the collaborators are double-bassist Dave Green and saxophonists Peter King, Evan Parker and Courtney Pine, trumpeter Gerard Presencer, fellow drummer Jim Keltner and vocalist and Rolling Stones live band member Bernard Fowler. The set features liner notes by music journalist and broadcaster Paul Sexton.— AP Entertainment Writer Mark KennedyNEW SERIES TO STREAM— Charity Lawson has 25 guys vying for her attention in the 20th season of the ABC reality dating show, “The Bachelorette.” The 27-year-old therapist from Georgia was featured on the last season of “The Bachelor” when Zach Shallcross was handing out roses. Shallcross sent Lawson home in week eight when he visited the ladies’ hometowns and met their families, saying the feelings weren’t there. “The Bachelorette” airs Mondays.— Idris Elba is stuck on the worst flight ever in the new series “Hijack” for Apple TV+. Elba plays Sam, a corporate negotiator whose flight from Dubai to London gets hijacked. Sam tries to employ his negotiating skills to defuse the situation on the seven-hour flight, so the passengers and crew make it home safely. The seven-episode series debuted this week with two episodes. The remaining episodes will be released weekly on Wednesdays. “Hijack” also co-stars Archie Panjabi.— John Krasinski makes his final bow in season four of “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” returning to Prime Video on Friday. The eight-episode season features Jack back in Washington, D.C. (for part of the time) and the return of Abbie Cornish as his love interest Cathy. Michael Peña also joins season four as well-known Clancy character Domingo “Ding” Chavez, a CIA special operative. Wendell Pierce, Michael Kelly and Betty Gabriel also return.— A fun family show premiering Friday on Netflix is “Is it Cake, Too?” based on the popular internet meme. The premise is simple: people guess whether very real-looking random objects like a handbag, a sewing machine and even a toilet are cake. Ten very talented baker artists compete for a cash prize. Guest judges include Joel McHale, “Saturday Night Live” cast member Chloe Fineman, Kirby Howell-Baptiste, and Dixie and Charli D’Amelio.— Alicia RancilioNEW VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY— It’s a good week for gamers who crave a little mystery on their menu. Crime O’Clock, from French publisher Just for Games, takes on a centuries-spanning conspiracy in a sprawling European city. Your job is to study detailed black-and-white maps from five different eras, searching for anomalies as you try to seal up cracks in the space-time continuum. It's like a time-traveling version of “Where's Waldo?” in which your actions in one time zone may help you crack cases in the others. The mystery unfolds Friday on Nintendo Switch and PC.— Also coming Friday is Capcom’s high-resolution remake of the 2011 cult classic Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. The protagonist is a freshly deceased man trying to figure out how he was killed and whodunit. The ghost can only possess a few objects in the land of the living, so he needs to carefully manipulate them to unearth clues and warn other potential victims. It’s a very clever puzzle, and the remake will be available on Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.— Lou Kesten___Catch up on AP’s entertainment coverage here: https://apnews.com/entertainment]"

While tech stocks have led the market higher year-to-date (YTD), 5G stocks have been left out of the party. The stocks of the biggest internet service providers in the U.S. are all in the red for the year as investors shun the sector and crowd into tech firms focused on artificial intelligence (AI). This means there is an opportunity to get some of the best 5G stocks to buy while they are discounted.The S&amp;P 500 Internet Select Industry Index is up a marginal 5% over the last year compared to a 24% gain in the Nasdaq. The reasons for the underperformance are many and include heated competition that has led to price cuts, a decline in consumer and business demand due to economic uncertainty and a slow rollout of 5G wireless infrastructure. The good news is that many 5G stocks look to be at or near a bottom, presenting an opportunity for investors. Here are three 5G stocks with explosive upside potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVerizon Communications (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockThere’s no question that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) has had a rough ride over the last few years. So far in 2023, VZ stock is down 9%, dragging its one year performance to a negative return of 28%. While unimpressive, there are some reasons for cautious optimism regarding Verizon. First, the stock looks to have bottomed in early June right around $34 a share, its lowest level in five years. Since then, the share price has risen 5% and the trend line appears to be moving in the right direction.VZ stock is also attractive right now given its dirt cheap valuation. With a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 7, Verizon looks to be among the most undervalued technology stocks available. Patient investors who take a position can enjoy a quarterly dividend payment that currently yields 7.16%, among the highest of any tech stock, while they wait for the share price to recover. The dividend equates to a 65 cents per share payment every three months. The company is also in the process of establishing a new management team, which could help.Story continuesQualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) hasn’t been entirely left out of this year’s rally in microchip and semiconductor stocks, but its definitely lagged behind its competitors in terms of performance. YTD QCOM stock is up 14%. Compare that to a 200% YTD gain for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Qualcomm has been hampered by the fact that its chips and semiconductors are used almost exclusively to enable wireless internet and mobile communications and it has no significant role in AI.However, investors should keep in mind that Qualcomm remains a major player in 5G wireless internet technology. Additionally, QCOM stock has a solid long-term performance, with the share price up 110% over the last five years. The company’s P/E ratio looks low relative to its peers at 13 and Qualcomm is one of the few microchip and semiconductor companies to pay a dividend. With a yield of 2.61%, or 80 cents a share per quarter, it’s a generous dividend.Ciena (CIEN)Ciena (CIEN) sign in Silicon Valley.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAnother company that is critical to wireless internet connectivity and whose stock looks to have bottomed recently is Ciena (NYSE:CIEN). The company makes the networking equipment, particularly optical connectivity and switches, that facilitate high-speed internet, including 5G wireless. Ciena’s customers are wireless internet providers such as Verizon and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). The company has annual revenue of more than $3.5 billion and 8,000 employees.In terms of its share price performance, CIEN stock is essentially flat over the past year (down 0.56%) after a 13% decline in 2023. However, the picture improves the further out one looks, with the stock up 80% over five years. As with the other names on this list, Ciena’s stock looks like it might have recently hit bottom. Since early June, the share price has climbed 7% higher. While Ciena doesn’t pay a dividend, its stock looks fairly valued right now with a P/E ratio of 32, which is about average for a tech company its size.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical industry and emerging trends, go directly to the Top 5 Medicine Producing Countries in the World.The global pharmaceutical industry is forecasted to grow from $1.4 billion in 2022 to over $2 billion by the end of 2028. This expansion would reflect a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% during the forecast period. The growth is expected to be driven by developing countries belonging to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These countries are experiencing healthy growth in population along with improved access to healthcare. Some countries in Asia, such as India and China, are also among the top Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) manufacturing countries. On the other hand, North American and European markets have matured and will experience low growth during this period. The United States of America (USA) has the distinction of being the largest producer of medicines in the world. Some experts even consider it the best country for the pharmaceutical industry due to the advancements in technology taking place in the country. Interestingly, the USA also leads the list of top pharmaceutical-importing countries, highlighting its significant role in the global pharmaceutical market.Consumption of medicine doses is expected to rise to around 3.4 trillion in 2027, which would reflect an 8% increase from the levels in 2022. Furthermore, the emergence of biosimilars, primarily due to exclusivity losses, is expected to provide the pharmaceutical industry with a tailwind of $140.7 billion in the next five years. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations (IFPMA) believes that the biopharmaceutical industry is responsible for a total contribution of $1.84 trillion to the global economy and provides employment to 5.5 million around the world in the fields of research and development (R&amp;D), manufacturing, distribution, and other functions. According to the Geneva, Switzerland-based trade association, there are over 9,000 compounds that are currently under production worldwide. The pharmaceutical industry is a research-intensive industry as compared to other high-tech industries. The R&amp;D spending of the pharmaceutical industry is 8.1 times higher than the R&amp;D spending of the aerospace and defence industry, 7.2 times higher than the R&amp;D spending of the chemical industry, and 1.2 times higher than the spending of the software and computer services industry. Since 2015, the pharmaceutical industry has spent more than $1 trillion on the development of new drugs.Story continuesThe industry needs to continue investing actively because new threats are emerging daily. According to IFPMA, Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in the form of drug-resistant superbugs could cause an annual economic loss of $3 trillion globally down the line. Every year, AMR is responsible for 1.27 million deaths globally and plays a part in the deaths of five million people globally. According to experts, this number could double by 2050. In addition to this, tuberculosis (TB) has the power to cause an economic loss of $1 trillion by the end of this decade. Meanwhile, any form of pandemic influenza can cause a yearly economic loss of $500 billion. These examples only highlight the importance of research and development in the pharmaceutical industry.There are a number of notable companies operating in the industry, such as Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). You can also take a look at the 25 Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies in the World here. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) became the first company in the history of the pharmaceutical industry to achieve annual sales of $100 billion in 2022. This was due to the positive impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on the top line of the New York-based company, as it contributed $37.8 billion during the 12 months. Meanwhile, Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was close behind in second position with an annual revenue of $94.94 billion in 2022. The company was also favourably impacted by its COVID-19 vaccine.Top 16 Medicine Producing Countries in the WorldPhoto by Myriam Zilles on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo shortlist the top 16 medicine-producing countries in the world, we collated the pharmaceutical production by country data using notable sources such as the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) and the Pharmaceutical Industry and Global Health Report.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Buy. Value investing is an investment strategy that involves identifying undervalued stocks in the stock market. It was popularized by Benjamin Graham, often referred to as the ""father of value investing"" and mentor to Warren Buffett. The main principle of value investing is to focus on the intrinsic value of a company rather than its market price. The strategy often entails a long-term perspective, as the market may take time to adjust to the true value of the stock. Historically, value investing has proven its efficacy in the long run, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as we mentioned in our article on 12 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy.The debate between growth and value stocks as the best picks for investment is a long-standing discussion, as both of them have given varied performances historically. During periods of economic expansion and optimism, growth stocks tend to outperform, while value stocks may shine during economic downturns or market corrections. Last year, when inflation was at its peak, value stocks declined by 7% globally, whereas growth equities saw a 28.6% drop. Moreover, value stocks in the US exhibited their strongest outperformance since the dot-com crash in 2000.Also read: 10 Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are BuyingThe AI frenzy has brought growth stocks into the limelight all over again this year. In May, the Russell 1000 Value Index experienced a 4% decline, while its growth counterpart recorded a similar-sized gain. To maximize returns, analysts advise including both value and growth stocks in one's portfolio. Wall Street Journal has highlighted that the average annualized five-year returns since 1984 have been similar for both types of stocks. However, there have been significant differences in returns over extended periods.Story continuesInvestors often solely consider only growth or value strategy at a time. In this regard, large-cap stocks attract more attention from value investors due to their higher visibility and liquidity. Moreover, larger companies may be more closely followed by analysts, making it easier for investors to evaluate their intrinsic value. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index, a stock market index that represents the performance of large-cap value stocks in the US, gained 5.45% in the past 12 months. The index tracks some of the best value stocks in the large-cap space, such as The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).15 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Buy Source: pexelsOur Methodology:For this article, we focused on companies with a market capitalization above $10 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of below 15.

Stocks are still largely up in June, though.Entering the final week of the month, the Nasdaq is up more than 7% while the S&amp;P 500 has risen nearly 5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is higher by just over 2%. Through the first half of the year, the Nasdaq remains up more than 28% with the S&amp;P sitting on gains north of 13%.During two days of testimony on Capitol Hill, Powell called inflation ""more persistent than we've expected,"" adding the central bank has a ""long way to go"" to bring inflation down. With limited data between now and the Fed's next policy announcement on July 26, Friday's inflation data will be even more closely watched.Last week, Powell referenced ""core"" PCE as being particularly stubborn.Data on Friday is expected to show ""core"" PCE — which strips out the costs of food and energy — rose 4.7% over the prior year in May, unchanged from April. The Fed targets 2% inflation, on average. Over the prior month, ""core"" PCE is expected to rise 0.4% in May.Story continues""May core PCE inflation is likely to be softer (we project 0.29% MoM), but we expect non-shelter services inflation to remain stubbornly high in coming months,"" Citi's team of economists wrote in a note on Friday. ""A resurgent housing market is raising further upside risks to 2024 inflation.""Data for new home sales and the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price index are expected on Tuesday. Economists project home prices fell 2.6% year-over-year in April.On the earnings front, Nike results will headline the list of the companies reporting. The nation’s leading athletic apparel brand has made progress offloading excess inventory over the last several quarters. But while the company already signaled it reached peak inventory bloat, some Wall Street analysts are still concerned inventory headwinds will weigh on gross margin growth.Nike's report will provide a clearer picture of the state of wholesale retail inventories after Foot Locker (FL) warned of troubles during its most recent quarterly earnings report.""Recent [North America] &amp; Europe sportswear channel checks make it clear that demand for mass sportswear has potentially slowed, leaving a sizable inventory glut across the industry that is currently being promoted away...a potential headwind that could pressure NKE revenue &amp; margin,"" Morgan Stanley equity analyst Alex Straton wrote in a note on Tuesday.The NIKE symbol hangs on the wall by the entrance of the NIKE department store at North Park Mall as customers are seen exiting the store Monday, March 19, 2012, in Dallas.

But Lee remains in the camp that inflation is cooling and believes that will play out in the week ahead with PCE and housing data.""To us, this looks increasingly like an economy slipping into an expansion, not sliding into a recession,"" Lee wrote.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical industry and emerging trends, go directly to the Top 5 Medicine Producing Countries in the World.The global pharmaceutical industry is forecasted to grow from $1.4 billion in 2022 to over $2 billion by the end of 2028. This expansion would reflect a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% during the forecast period. The growth is expected to be driven by developing countries belonging to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These countries are experiencing healthy growth in population along with improved access to healthcare. Some countries in Asia, such as India and China, are also among the top Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) manufacturing countries. On the other hand, North American and European markets have matured and will experience low growth during this period. The United States of America (USA) has the distinction of being the largest producer of medicines in the world. Some experts even consider it the best country for the pharmaceutical industry due to the advancements in technology taking place in the country. Interestingly, the USA also leads the list of top pharmaceutical-importing countries, highlighting its significant role in the global pharmaceutical market.Consumption of medicine doses is expected to rise to around 3.4 trillion in 2027, which would reflect an 8% increase from the levels in 2022. Furthermore, the emergence of biosimilars, primarily due to exclusivity losses, is expected to provide the pharmaceutical industry with a tailwind of $140.7 billion in the next five years. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations (IFPMA) believes that the biopharmaceutical industry is responsible for a total contribution of $1.84 trillion to the global economy and provides employment to 5.5 million around the world in the fields of research and development (R&amp;D), manufacturing, distribution, and other functions. According to the Geneva, Switzerland-based trade association, there are over 9,000 compounds that are currently under production worldwide. The pharmaceutical industry is a research-intensive industry as compared to other high-tech industries. The R&amp;D spending of the pharmaceutical industry is 8.1 times higher than the R&amp;D spending of the aerospace and defence industry, 7.2 times higher than the R&amp;D spending of the chemical industry, and 1.2 times higher than the spending of the software and computer services industry. Since 2015, the pharmaceutical industry has spent more than $1 trillion on the development of new drugs.Story continuesThe industry needs to continue investing actively because new threats are emerging daily. According to IFPMA, Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in the form of drug-resistant superbugs could cause an annual economic loss of $3 trillion globally down the line. Every year, AMR is responsible for 1.27 million deaths globally and plays a part in the deaths of five million people globally. According to experts, this number could double by 2050. In addition to this, tuberculosis (TB) has the power to cause an economic loss of $1 trillion by the end of this decade. Meanwhile, any form of pandemic influenza can cause a yearly economic loss of $500 billion. These examples only highlight the importance of research and development in the pharmaceutical industry.There are a number of notable companies operating in the industry, such as Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). You can also take a look at the 25 Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies in the World here. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) became the first company in the history of the pharmaceutical industry to achieve annual sales of $100 billion in 2022. This was due to the positive impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on the top line of the New York-based company, as it contributed $37.8 billion during the 12 months. Meanwhile, Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was close behind in second position with an annual revenue of $94.94 billion in 2022. The company was also favourably impacted by its COVID-19 vaccine.Top 16 Medicine Producing Countries in the WorldPhoto by Myriam Zilles on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo shortlist the top 16 medicine-producing countries in the world, we collated the pharmaceutical production by country data using notable sources such as the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) and the Pharmaceutical Industry and Global Health Report.

The company's shares have dropped around 29% so far this year as it works to develop its strategy past the COVID vaccines and therapeutics that drove revenue and earnings for the past few years. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index, which tracks drugmakers, is down around 1% over the same period.The company said it expects to finalize plans for the danuglipron late-stage program by the end of the year, and is also developing a once-daily, modified release version of that drug. Pfizer has been developing both pills in parallel, but had said all things being equal its preference would be for the once daily lotiglipron.The news comes days after competitor Eli Lilly released promising data for its own once-daily experimental pill, orforglipron.Truist Securities analyst Robyn Karnauskas said Lilly is now ahead in the race for a once-a-day obesity pill.""We believe while (twice a day) has advantages, we really need a (once daily) formulation for weight loss,"" she said in a research note.Pfizer said last month that danuglipron helped patients lose weight on par with Novo Nordisk's Ozempic in a mid-stage study that tested it in patients with Type 2 diabetes.U.S. demand for Wegovy and Ozempic, the brand names for Novo Nordisk's once-weekly injections for treating obesity and diabetes respectively, has soared recently.Story continuesThe enormous demand for treatments like Wegovy could support as many as 10 competing products with annual sales reaching up to $100 billion within a decade, mostly in the United States, industry executives and analysts have said.None of the patients in the lotiglipron trials reported liver-related symptoms or side effects, there was no evidence of liver failure and none required treatment, Pfizer said.Liver enzyme elevations observed in lotiglipron trials have not been seen in patients enrolled in danuglipron trials, the company added.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced its decision to continue to progress one oral late-stage glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1-RA) candidate toward further clinical development for the potential treatment of adults with obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Moving forward, the company will continue advancing the clinical program for danuglipron (PF-06882961), subject to results from the ongoing Phase 2 trial, and discontinue the clinical development of lotiglipron (PF-07081532). The company expects to finalize plans for the danuglipron late-stage program by the end of 2023 and also is developing a once-daily modified release version.""Building on Pfizer’s small molecule design expertise, we were developing two promising GLP-1-RAs that have shown proof of concept, with the intent of selecting one to advance into further clinical studies. We look forward to analyzing the danuglipron Phase 2 results and selecting the dose and titration schedule that will maximize the therapeutic benefit and safety and tolerability,"" said William Sessa, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Internal Medicine, Pfizer. ""If successful in clinical trials and approved, danuglipron could be in a prime position to differentiate based on profile, including full receptor agonism, which we believe has the potential to translate to robust efficacy.""Results previously published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Network Open from the Phase 2 study (NCT03985293) of danuglipron in T2DM showed dose-dependent placebo-adjusted reductions (doses ranging from 2.5 mg through 120 mg for 16 weeks) in HbA1c of up to -1.16%; fasting plasma glucose of -33.24 mg/dL; and body weight of -4.17 kg over 16 weeks. The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The Phase 2b study of danuglipron in non-diabetic obesity participants is currently ongoing (doses ranging from 40 mg through 200 mg for up to 32 weeks) and expected to complete by end of year. The safety profile of danuglipron to date, including transaminase changes, appears to be similar to the peptidic GLP-1R agonist class.Story continuesThe decision to terminate the clinical development of lotiglipron is based on pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 drug-drug-interaction studies (C3991040 – NCT05671653 and C3991047 – NCT05788328) and laboratory measurements of elevated transaminases in these Phase 1 studies as well as the ongoing Phase 2 study C3991004 (NCT05579977). None of these participants reported liver related symptoms or side effects, there was no evidence of liver failure, and none needed treatment.Such transaminase elevations have not been observed in the over 1,400 patients enrolled in the danuglipron program. Data from these studies evaluating lotiglipron will be presented at a scientific conference or published in peer-reviewed journal(s).About Danuglipron and LotiglipronDanuglipron (PF-06882961) and lotiglipron (PF-07081532) are experimental medicines that are not approved for use by health authorities at this time. Both danuglipron and lotiglipron are taken as a tablet by mouth and are a type of medicine known as GLP-1-RA. These medicines are intended to keep blood sugar at healthy levels and work by increasing the amount of insulin released and lowering the amount of glucagon released into the blood. They also slow down the digestion of food and increase the feeling of fullness after eating.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Buy. Value investing is an investment strategy that involves identifying undervalued stocks in the stock market. It was popularized by Benjamin Graham, often referred to as the ""father of value investing"" and mentor to Warren Buffett. The main principle of value investing is to focus on the intrinsic value of a company rather than its market price. The strategy often entails a long-term perspective, as the market may take time to adjust to the true value of the stock. Historically, value investing has proven its efficacy in the long run, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as we mentioned in our article on 12 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy.The debate between growth and value stocks as the best picks for investment is a long-standing discussion, as both of them have given varied performances historically. During periods of economic expansion and optimism, growth stocks tend to outperform, while value stocks may shine during economic downturns or market corrections. Last year, when inflation was at its peak, value stocks declined by 7% globally, whereas growth equities saw a 28.6% drop. Moreover, value stocks in the US exhibited their strongest outperformance since the dot-com crash in 2000.Also read: 10 Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are BuyingThe AI frenzy has brought growth stocks into the limelight all over again this year. In May, the Russell 1000 Value Index experienced a 4% decline, while its growth counterpart recorded a similar-sized gain. To maximize returns, analysts advise including both value and growth stocks in one's portfolio. Wall Street Journal has highlighted that the average annualized five-year returns since 1984 have been similar for both types of stocks. However, there have been significant differences in returns over extended periods.Story continuesInvestors often solely consider only growth or value strategy at a time. In this regard, large-cap stocks attract more attention from value investors due to their higher visibility and liquidity. Moreover, larger companies may be more closely followed by analysts, making it easier for investors to evaluate their intrinsic value. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index, a stock market index that represents the performance of large-cap value stocks in the US, gained 5.45% in the past 12 months. The index tracks some of the best value stocks in the large-cap space, such as The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Buy. Value investing is an investment strategy that involves identifying undervalued stocks in the stock market. It was popularized by Benjamin Graham, often referred to as the ""father of value investing"" and mentor to Warren Buffett. The main principle of value investing is to focus on the intrinsic value of a company rather than its market price. The strategy often entails a long-term perspective, as the market may take time to adjust to the true value of the stock. Historically, value investing has proven its efficacy in the long run, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as we mentioned in our article on 12 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy.The debate between growth and value stocks as the best picks for investment is a long-standing discussion, as both of them have given varied performances historically. During periods of economic expansion and optimism, growth stocks tend to outperform, while value stocks may shine during economic downturns or market corrections. Last year, when inflation was at its peak, value stocks declined by 7% globally, whereas growth equities saw a 28.6% drop. Moreover, value stocks in the US exhibited their strongest outperformance since the dot-com crash in 2000.Also read: 10 Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are BuyingThe AI frenzy has brought growth stocks into the limelight all over again this year. In May, the Russell 1000 Value Index experienced a 4% decline, while its growth counterpart recorded a similar-sized gain. To maximize returns, analysts advise including both value and growth stocks in one's portfolio. Wall Street Journal has highlighted that the average annualized five-year returns since 1984 have been similar for both types of stocks. However, there have been significant differences in returns over extended periods.Story continuesInvestors often solely consider only growth or value strategy at a time. In this regard, large-cap stocks attract more attention from value investors due to their higher visibility and liquidity. Moreover, larger companies may be more closely followed by analysts, making it easier for investors to evaluate their intrinsic value. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index, a stock market index that represents the performance of large-cap value stocks in the US, gained 5.45% in the past 12 months. The index tracks some of the best value stocks in the large-cap space, such as The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

63,e3a9d09e-862a-341f-a81f-ac75954ccd25,NWSA,2023-06-26,Realtor.com® May Rental Report: Rent Prices Dip; Declines Expected to Continue,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-may-rental-report-100000242.html,1687773600,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[Rent prices down 0.5% year-over-year, their first drop since the start of Realtor.com® rental data trend tracking in 2020SANTA CLARA, Calif., June 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Realtor.com® May Rental Report found that renters are beginning to see some relief, with the median asking monthly rent in the 50 largest U.S. metros decreasing -0.5% year-over-year to $1,739. Nationally, rent prices increased $3 from last month, but were down $38 from the July 2022 peak. Realtor.com®'s 2023 Forecast Update predicts that rents will continue to drop, averaging -0.9% from 2022.""In May, we saw the first year-over-year decline in rents, a sea-change from the double-digit growth that renters contended with in much of 2021 and 2022. This is yet another sign that rental-driven inflation is likely behind us, even though we may not see this trend in official measures until next year,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Although still modest, a decline in rents combined with cooling inflation and a still-strong job market is definitely welcome news for households.""While rental declines are a positive sign for household affordability, it is important to note that rents are still $344 (+24.7%) higher than the same time in 2019, before the pandemic began.""Despite the decline in typical asking rents, households who may not have moved in several years are likely to see their rent increase if they're looking for a new home,"" said Hale.Western markets seeing biggest rent dropsRent prices in the expensive West are seeing the largest year-over-year declines (-3.0%), with the South close behind (-1.0%). More affordable Midwestern markets continued to increase (4.5%), but at a much slower pace than in previous months. Rents in the Northeast have stayed relatively strong, as low unemployment rates and relatively slow new construction improvements have kept demand high and supply limited. Densely populated markets like New York City (+6.8%) and Boston (+3.3%) have shown resilience.Story continuesExpectations for the second half of 2023In some good news for renters, Realtor.com® anticipates that rents will continue to drop, averaging -0.9% year-over-year in 2023. Strong multi-family new construction has helped to improve the availability of units, which is helping to improve prices. This, combined with a number of renters choosing to stay in their units longer in order to save money, will help to reduce rental market competition through the end of the year.""Looking forward, we expect to see a continued, albeit small, year-over-year decline in rental prices throughout the remainder of the year. Renters may find themselves with more bargaining power and may have better luck finding an affordable unit this year. Meanwhile, landlords looking for help setting rents in a shifting market can find tools from Realtor.com®'s Avail,"" said Hale.Rental Data – 50 Largest Metropolitan Areas – May 2023 MetroMedian Rent 0-2 bedroomYOY 0-2 bedroomAtlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Ga.$1,660-3.1 %Austin-Round Rock, Texas$1,641-5.6 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Md.$1,8502.0 %Birmingham-Hoover, Ala.$1,2613.1 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H.$2,8323.3 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.NANACharlotte-Concord-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.$1,576-3.5 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Ill.-Ind.-Wisc.$1,714-1.0 %Cincinnati, Ohio-Ky-Ind.$1,2187.5 %Cleveland-Elyria, Ohio$1,215-1.0 %Columbus, Ohio$1,3299.3 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas$1,542-3.6 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.$1,969-3.0 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Mich.$1,3235.1 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.NANAHouston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas$1,4342.0 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind.$1,3317.3 %Jacksonville, Fla.$1,5592.3 %Kansas City, Mo.-Kan.$1,3083.1 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev.$1,531-6.0 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif.$2,833-2.6 %Louisville/Jefferson County, Ky.-Ind.$1,2107.2 %Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark.$1,3250.2 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla.$2,341-2.3 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, Wisc.$1,5976.2 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wisc.$1,5111.2 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, Tenn.$1,618-0.7 %New Orleans-Metairie, La.NANANew York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Penn.$2,9116.8 %Oklahoma City, Okla.$9974.6 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla.$1,769-2.3 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-Md.$1,8231.3 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.$1,663-5.7 %Pittsburgh, Penn.$1,4503.8 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Ore.-Wash.$1,680-1.3 %Providence-Warwick, R.I.-Mass.NANARaleigh, N.C.$1,558-2.9 %Richmond, Va.$1,4484.9 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.$2,302-5.9 %Rochester, N.Y.NANASacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, Calif.$1,847-3.5 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas$1,2760.2 %San Diego-Carlsbad, Calif.$2,966-0.6 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif.$2,844-4.0 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif.$3,3471.0 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Wash.$2,112-1.8 %St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.$1,3277.7 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.$1,793-4.0 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.$1,436-1.6 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, D.C.-Va.-Md.-W.V.$2,2144.0 % Methodology Rental data as of May 2023 for studio, 1-bedroom, or 2-bedroom units advertised as for-rent on Realtor.com®. Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). We use rental sources that reliably report data each month within the top 50 largest metropolitan areas. Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.With the release of its May rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. The new methodology is expected to yield a cleaner, more representative and more consistent measurement of rental listings and trends at both the national and local level. The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since May 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

ENPH, Public Storage PSA, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA.2 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Stocks to Buy for Long-Term GrowthToday’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into where the stock market stands as we near the end of June and turn the page on the huge first-half rally. The bulls appear to be in control heading into the heart of the summer.Instead of attempting to chase the handful of mega-cap tech stocks that have soared already, investors with long-term horizons might want to consider buying large-cap stocks still trading 30% to 50% below their record highs heading into July.The bulls reasserted themselves on Thursday. The Nasdaq opened lower, but it only stayed red for a little while before buyers rushed in and turned up the heat in the afternoon, pushing the tech-heavy index to close nearly 1% higher. The solid day was driven by gains from Tesla, Amazon, and others. The S&amp;P 500 eventually ended the session up 0.4%, after it opened lower and swung between small gains and losses.The upbeat day ended a miniature skid and helps keep both indexes near 52-week highs. Investors likely want to keep a close eye on the 4,300 level for the S&amp;P 500, as it might be a line the bulls have to hold as Wall Street enters the heart of the summer and more investors call for a mega-cap tech pullback.That said, even if the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq experience a downturn it might be driven by profit-taking on Nvidia and others. On top of that, different areas of the market are finally gaining some momentum as more investors and money come in off the sidelines.Investors who can stomach the possibility of more near-term risks might decide now is time to start buying beaten-down large cap names that trade miles below their highs even as Nvidia, Apple, and others break new ground. Remember, some of the best times to buy stocks is when seemingly no one else does.Story continuesEnphase Energy, Inc. is a technology firm that’s thrived as one of the largest makers of microinverter-based solar and battery systems in the world. Inverters are vital high-tech components in the solar ecosystem because they convert the DC power that solar panels produce into the AC power used in our homes and businesses. The solar energy market is well established in the U.S. and across many other countries. Plus, hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into solar energy expansion as part of an evolving energy landscape.Enphase topped our EPS estimate once again in late April, but it provided downbeat guidance as it faces near-term setbacks in the U.S. ENPH stock has been crushed in 2023 based on its subdued outlook and overall slowing growth as it comes up against a very difficult-to-compete-against stretch that saw it soar from around $300 million in sales in 2018 to $2.33 billion in 2022.Still, Zacks estimates call for Enphase’s revenue to climb from $2.33 billion to $3.10 billion in FY23, which would mark 33% sales growth and then post another 25% revenue expansion to reach $3.87 billion next year. Meanwhile, its adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by 20% and 35%, respectively.ENPH currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its adjusted EPS outlook has held up rather well considering the thrashing the stock has taken—with its outlook for FY23 and FY24 still up from where they were last year.Enphase shares have soared roughly 2,200% in the last five years to double Tesla and Nvidia. This staggering run includes a 50% fall from its early December 2022 records. ENPH is now trading around where it was at the end of 2020 and nearly 60% below its average Zacks price target. Enphase is also trading at a 76% discount to its highs at 33X forward 12-month earnings.All that said, ENPH is hovering at a potentially worrisome level in the near term from a technical perspective, with the stock below both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Investors might want to hold off until we see how Enphase trades in the coming days and weeks. But if it finds support at its 200-week moving average (nearby chart) it could be poised to start mounting a comeback.Public Storage is one of the largest owners, operators, and developers of self-storage facilities on the planet, with nearly 3,000 facilities in the U.S. and almost two million customers. PSA is a REIT that’s been gaining momentum for years as Americans continue to buy more stuff. Public Storage grew its revenue at a steadily impressive pace over the last 20-plus years, including 22% sales growth in 2022 (+15% comps) and 17% in 2021.Zacks estimates call for PSA to post another 7.4% revenue growth in FY23 and 5.2% in FY24, which would mark stronger expansion compared to the several-year stretch prior to Covid. And Public Storage’s adjusted FFO (which are essentially earnings for REITs) are projected to climb by over 5% during both years.PSA lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, with its bottom-line revisions stagnating recently. Public Storage’s FY23 and FY24 outlook does, however, remain solidly above where they were at the start of 2022. PSA flexed its financial firepower when it lifted its dividend by 50% back in February to help it yield 4.2% at the moment.PSA shares have climbed 735% over the last 20 years to crush the S&amp;P 500’s 350%. And Public Storage has climbed by 51% in the past three years to top the market’s 40% run. The outperformance includes the fact that Public Storage stock is down 30% from its April 2022 highs. PSA is currently trading 20% below its average Zacks price target. The stock is also sitting 20% below its own 10-year median and at a 40% discount to its highs at 16.8X forward 12-month earnings.Like Enphase, Public Storage is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, as well as sitting underneath its 50-week. The stock might have to find support at its 200-week moving average soon. And if it does, some investors might want to start buying PSA shares.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

73,6ca9fbfc-9936-30f7-a96f-afee20eaa664,CL,2023-06-26,3 Undervalued Consumer Stocks to Buy in June,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-undervalued-consumer-stocks-buy-113042052.html,1687260642,STORY,"['K', 'CL', 'UL']","[Consumer staples stocks have trailed the market this year, up just 0.2% compared with a roughly 15% advance for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. This is somewhat surprising given the essential nature of these companies’ products, which include food, personal care items, cleaning supplies and healthcare products. Yet, on the bright side, this underperformance is offering a chance for investors to purchase undervalued consumer stocks.In a recession, consumer staples tend to outperform as people continue buying essential items while foregoing more discretionary purchases. Yet, investors have been more attracted to riskier asset classes such as technology stocks this year. The consensus view appears to be that any recession we enter is likely to be shallow and short-lived.This environment has pushed many consumer staples stocks down to undervalued levels, presenting an opportunity for investors to take a position at attractive entry points. Here are three undervalued consumer stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKellogg Company (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comShares of the Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) have been trading sideways for some time now. In fact, the stock is down 1.7% over the past five years and up just over 3% over the past decade.One would assume the company behind popular cereal brands such as Corn Flakes and Frosted Flakes, as well as Pringles chips and Cheez-It crackers, would be performing better. But, alas, the best word to describe the performance of K stock is “stagnant.”If not undervalued, shares are at least fairly valued at a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.4. K stock also pays a generous 50-cent quarterly dividend for a 3.6% yield. So, what gives?A lack of growth in its legacy cereal business amid shifting consumer trends and growing competition has held the stock back over the past 10 years. More immediately, investors appear to be waiting for Kellogg to separate its cereal business from its other consumer products, mostly faster-growing snack items. The higher-growth Kellogg operations will be placed in a new company called “Kellanova,” while the North American cereal business will be renamed “WK Kellogg Co.”Story continuesInvestors might want to get into K stock now before the split happens and take advantage of any bump that occurs, especially with the growth-focused Kellanova business.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is another consumer stock that could be performing better. The company behind Colgate toothpaste Speed Stick deodorant, Irish Spring soap and Hill’s pet food has seen its share price decline 1.3% this year. Over the past five years, CL stock has risen a marginal 20%.As with Kellogg, Colgate-Palmolive’s stock looks to be fairly valued. And the company rewards shareholders with a 48-cent quarterly dividend for a 2.5% yield.Colgate-Palmolive’s first-quarter results were strong.  Revenue rose 8.5% year over year to $4.8 billion, which beat the consensus estimate. Earnings per share (EPS) of 73 cents were also better than expected, as analysts were calling for 70 cents. Management raised its full-year outlook, saying it now expects sales growth of 4% to 6%, compared with 3% to 5% previously.CL is among the best consumer stocks to buy with an economic recession looming. The essential nature of its products makes Colgate-Palmolive a largely recession-proof investment.Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comBritish consumer products company Unilever (NYSE:UL) might be less familiar to American investors than today’s other top undervalued consumer stocks. However, its products are certainly household names. Unilever’s brands include Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Dove soap.Like the other names on this list, UL stock has been a chronic underperformer. This year, the company’s share price is up just 3%. Over the past five years, the stock has declined nearly 6%.UL stock looks downright cheap with a P/E ratio of less than 16. It, too, pays a handsome quarterly dividend of 44.5 cents for a current yield of 3.5%.The stock has been weighed down over the years by poor sales and rising competition in the food space. A failed attempt to buy the consumer health division of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) last year didn’t help either. More immediately, UL stock was dinged by news that the company’s chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, plans to leave the company in May 2024.Still, Unilever is trying to get its house in order and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Alan Jope seems determined to turn things around.

ENPH, Public Storage PSA, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA.2 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Stocks to Buy for Long-Term GrowthToday’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into where the stock market stands as we near the end of June and turn the page on the huge first-half rally. The bulls appear to be in control heading into the heart of the summer.Instead of attempting to chase the handful of mega-cap tech stocks that have soared already, investors with long-term horizons might want to consider buying large-cap stocks still trading 30% to 50% below their record highs heading into July.The bulls reasserted themselves on Thursday. The Nasdaq opened lower, but it only stayed red for a little while before buyers rushed in and turned up the heat in the afternoon, pushing the tech-heavy index to close nearly 1% higher. The solid day was driven by gains from Tesla, Amazon, and others. The S&amp;P 500 eventually ended the session up 0.4%, after it opened lower and swung between small gains and losses.The upbeat day ended a miniature skid and helps keep both indexes near 52-week highs. Investors likely want to keep a close eye on the 4,300 level for the S&amp;P 500, as it might be a line the bulls have to hold as Wall Street enters the heart of the summer and more investors call for a mega-cap tech pullback.That said, even if the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq experience a downturn it might be driven by profit-taking on Nvidia and others. On top of that, different areas of the market are finally gaining some momentum as more investors and money come in off the sidelines.Investors who can stomach the possibility of more near-term risks might decide now is time to start buying beaten-down large cap names that trade miles below their highs even as Nvidia, Apple, and others break new ground. Remember, some of the best times to buy stocks is when seemingly no one else does.Story continuesEnphase Energy, Inc. is a technology firm that’s thrived as one of the largest makers of microinverter-based solar and battery systems in the world. Inverters are vital high-tech components in the solar ecosystem because they convert the DC power that solar panels produce into the AC power used in our homes and businesses. The solar energy market is well established in the U.S. and across many other countries. Plus, hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into solar energy expansion as part of an evolving energy landscape.Enphase topped our EPS estimate once again in late April, but it provided downbeat guidance as it faces near-term setbacks in the U.S. ENPH stock has been crushed in 2023 based on its subdued outlook and overall slowing growth as it comes up against a very difficult-to-compete-against stretch that saw it soar from around $300 million in sales in 2018 to $2.33 billion in 2022.Still, Zacks estimates call for Enphase’s revenue to climb from $2.33 billion to $3.10 billion in FY23, which would mark 33% sales growth and then post another 25% revenue expansion to reach $3.87 billion next year. Meanwhile, its adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by 20% and 35%, respectively.ENPH currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its adjusted EPS outlook has held up rather well considering the thrashing the stock has taken—with its outlook for FY23 and FY24 still up from where they were last year.Enphase shares have soared roughly 2,200% in the last five years to double Tesla and Nvidia. This staggering run includes a 50% fall from its early December 2022 records. ENPH is now trading around where it was at the end of 2020 and nearly 60% below its average Zacks price target. Enphase is also trading at a 76% discount to its highs at 33X forward 12-month earnings.All that said, ENPH is hovering at a potentially worrisome level in the near term from a technical perspective, with the stock below both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Investors might want to hold off until we see how Enphase trades in the coming days and weeks. But if it finds support at its 200-week moving average (nearby chart) it could be poised to start mounting a comeback.Public Storage is one of the largest owners, operators, and developers of self-storage facilities on the planet, with nearly 3,000 facilities in the U.S. and almost two million customers. PSA is a REIT that’s been gaining momentum for years as Americans continue to buy more stuff. Public Storage grew its revenue at a steadily impressive pace over the last 20-plus years, including 22% sales growth in 2022 (+15% comps) and 17% in 2021.Zacks estimates call for PSA to post another 7.4% revenue growth in FY23 and 5.2% in FY24, which would mark stronger expansion compared to the several-year stretch prior to Covid. And Public Storage’s adjusted FFO (which are essentially earnings for REITs) are projected to climb by over 5% during both years.PSA lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, with its bottom-line revisions stagnating recently. Public Storage’s FY23 and FY24 outlook does, however, remain solidly above where they were at the start of 2022. PSA flexed its financial firepower when it lifted its dividend by 50% back in February to help it yield 4.2% at the moment.PSA shares have climbed 735% over the last 20 years to crush the S&amp;P 500’s 350%. And Public Storage has climbed by 51% in the past three years to top the market’s 40% run. The outperformance includes the fact that Public Storage stock is down 30% from its April 2022 highs. PSA is currently trading 20% below its average Zacks price target. The stock is also sitting 20% below its own 10-year median and at a 40% discount to its highs at 16.8X forward 12-month earnings.Like Enphase, Public Storage is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, as well as sitting underneath its 50-week. The stock might have to find support at its 200-week moving average soon. And if it does, some investors might want to start buying PSA shares.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Here’s what those employees say it’s doing right,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fortune-500-company-faces-backlash-123000562.html,1687696200,STORY,['INTU'],"[Jessica Darke recently relocated to Connecticut from Arizona, where gender-affirming care has been restricted for minors and transgender athletes are effectively barred from competing in some school sports. As a trans woman, Darke feared for her safety, well-being, and future access to necessary health care. So she opted to uproot herself, and her employer’s relocation benefits helped her absorb the costs of a 2,500-mile move to the opposite corner of the country.It wasn’t the first time Darke found support from her employer. Darke is a senior product manager for security research and development at Intuit, the Fortune 500 financial software company behind TurboTax, Mint, QuickBooks, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp. She came out as a trans woman about ten years ago, one of the first to do so at the company, which employs more than 17,300 people in the U.S. Since coming out, Darke has become a co-chair of the global pride employee resource group; she also helped form the company’s Trans Advisory Board to represent approximately 120 employees at Intuit who are trans, nonbinary, or have trans-identifying family members.“Since I came out, I have felt nothing but support from our HR and our benefits and our people's team,” Darke said. “But that support has only grown and the community that is supporting people like me and the families like ours, in this company is real.”meta metaA conservative push to curb trans rights and access to health care is threatening trans people across the country, inflicting stress that Darke calls “unbearable.” While many efforts have targeted trans youth, a bill in Florida has impacted trans adults' access to care. Other bills that would do the same have been introduced in Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas. These treatments, which include hormone treatments and gender-confirmation surgeries, are supported by major medical associations such as the World Health Organization and the American Medical Association.Story continuesSeveral Fortune 500 companies have publicly expressed support for their trans employees in the past–and some now offer to pay travel costs for employees who need to go out-of-state to avoid bans on gender-affirming care. (Many have put similar plans in place for employees who need abortions.) But despite the imminent impact on employees and their families, many companies have stayed out of the public conversation about the new anti-trans legislation. Fortune reached out to Amazon, Target, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, and Intuit, all of which have previously committed to covering gender-affirming care.Target, which has been criticized by the LGBTQ community for retreating in the face of right-wing backlash, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Microsoft declined to comment. Morgan Stanley said it did not want to comment on an issue that relates to pending legislation. Amazon responded with general statements about the company’s dedication to offering benefits that fit employees’ needs but declined to elaborate on trans-specific benefits.Intuit, on the other hand, had lots to share and discussed the company’s approach at length.With initiatives ranging from covering vital health care costs to engaging with national trans rights advocacy groups, Intuit has emerged as a leading example of how companies can support trans employees. Its employees say that leadership’s engagement, willingness to listen, and proactive partnerships with activism groups help them feel secure at work at a time when they feel under public attack.The CEO embraces the Trans SummitDarke and other Intuit employees emphasized that the leadership team at Intuit has made an intentional effort to listen to the trans community at the company.It all started when the company hosted its first Trans Summit. About a year after Tanner Arnold, a program manager for QuickBooks payroll, came out at Intuit, he started talking with other trans coworkers about the challenges in transitioning at work, from name changes in the company’s systems to health care coverage. When the company’s then-head of diversity, equity, and inclusion, Scott Beth, heard about these issues, he suggested the company hold a summit.The first Trans Summit hosted nearly 150 people in January 2020. Darke and Arnold were among a handful of employees who led the event and became what is now known as the Trans Advisory Board.Sasan Goodarzi, president and chief executive officer of Intuit Inc., smiles during a Bloomberg Television interview in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2020. Intuit -- the software giant behind TurboTax -- said Monday it's buying Credit Karma for about $7.1 billion in cash and stock. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAfter the summit, Beth facilitated a meeting with the Trans Advisory Board and top executives, including CEO Sasan Goodarzi, so that the trans employees could reiterate some of the challenges they were facing. “Our instruction was to let loose, tell them everything that’s been difficult. And so we did,” Arnold said. “And they just took notes. They didn’t try to show how that wasn’t true, or they didn’t try to say ‘but, but, but.’ They just listened.”What was more surprising, Arnold said, was that the company followed through on making some changes, even as the world was being upended around them by COVID-19. By June of 2020, new benefits for trans and LGBTQ employees had been expanded, including coverage of the gender-affirming care that some states are now attempting to ban.The meeting after the Trans Summit was the beginning of a formal back-and-forth between the Trans Advisory Board and human resources that has evolved into a mutual trust to work through issues as they arise. Leadership’s ongoing attention to the matter has relieved the trans community of the burden of taking the initiative to raise issues.“The coolest thing is, we don't have to have regular conversations anymore because it's just part of the thought process to go into anything now,” Arnold said, noting that product teams have come to the Trans Advisory Board in the past to ask how they could make language in their products more gender inclusive. “When it comes to trans issues, they're coming to us.”Arnold and Darke say that the company’s motivation to help comes from the top.CEO Goodarzi has remained involved in the Trans Summit (now known as the Trans+ Summit), which current chief DEI officer Humera Shahid says is the only one of its kind held by a big tech company. For the 2023 summit, Goodzari tuned in remotely for a fireside chat with his adult child Aryana Goodarzi, who uses they/she pronouns and identifies as gay; the two discussed Aryana’s coming out journey together.Sasan Goodarzi told the audience that Intuit, like many other corporations that celebrate Pride month and recognize LGBTQ+ customers and employees, receives a lot of backlash for its stance on inclusivity. In fact, he said, he receives emails directly from angry people who threaten to take their business elsewhere. But he doesn’t back down.“I respond to every customer, letting them know that this is who we are, this is what we stand for,"" he said at the summit. ""And perhaps you should change who you are. Good luck using somebody else’s product.”Finding partners and advocatesIn 2022, Intuit donated $500,000 to the National Center of Transgender Equality, an advocacy group working to change policy and society to advance trans equality. Intuit is also a member of America Competes, a coalition of 40 businesses making the case that the anti-LGBTQ laws being passed around the country are bad for businesses.Protecting employees from the onslaught of anti-LGBTQ legislation, however, is not as simple as donating to an advocacy group. Some bills introduced in state legislatures aim to ban gender-affirming care for people up to age 26. Others threaten to ban insurance companies from covering such procedures for people of any age. As the bills continue to expand beyond bans for trans youth, companies with national or remote workforces will have to address how this impacts employees and their families.Shahid said that Intuit is not making any sweeping policy changes in response to the legislation. The insurance that Intuit provides its employees is a national plan that might cover travel costs for care if a service is not provided in a certain state. Shahid said in cases where the employee still needs support in getting access to care, Intuit will assess the situation on a case-by-case basis.Still, the partnerships with advocacy groups are meaningful to Darke and Arnold. They both praised GenderCool, a Chicago-based nonprofit that aims to educate and advance trans rights through youth storytelling.Intuit has invited the organization and its youth “champions” to speak at the first two Trans Summit events. Intuit also piloted GenderCool’s reverse mentorship program, where company executives spend time with trans youth over the course of a month. The program is designed to help company leaders learn from young people to better understand the increasingly gender-fluid Gen Z entering the workforce.GenderCool cofounder Gearah Goldstein considers Intuit a leader in corporate support for trans employees. “Intuit is part of a core group that early on in our organization’s founding was interested in engaging with us to lift up trans voices in their own companies, but they also went out of their way to help us,” she said.Meta meta.The anti-LGBTQ laws are putting companies in a difficult position that could soon force action beyond partnering with these groups or issuing public statements.Christy Mallory, the legal director at UCLA’s William Institute researching gender policy law, said that this moment compares to the difficulty companies faced before gay marriage was legal. She said that Intuit’s strategy to make decisions on an individual basis rather than instituting a company-wide policy can be costly, and the anti-LGBTQ push overall can make recruiting difficult.“Imagine a straight, cisgender couple with a transgender child. It's going to be hard to get those parents to come work in Florida,” Mallory said. “So the implications are actually really broad when you kind of think about all the different ways that employees interact with their companies.”Darke and Arnold recognize that it has not been all perfect at Intuit, but they have trust in the company to deal with issues as best as they can when they arise.In the face of numerous attacks, they feel there could always be more to do to fight back. When another piece of legislation passes or a governor issues an executive order, Darke finds herself racing to check Intuit’s Slack channel for trans employees and their families to see who might live in that state, reminding them to reach out to HR to talk through options. It is her way of feeling like she is doing something.“I don't know what can be done, other than to keep doing what we're doing. So, would I love to see more? Yes. Do I know what it looks like? No,” Darke said. “So I just want us to keep fighting, and keep doing what's right by our people, making sure other people know that we are a safe place to come to. That's the thing that I can ask.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?
