This compares to earnings of $1.44 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurance data provider would post earnings of $1.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of 7.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Verisk , which belongs to the Zacks Business - Information Services industry, posted revenues of $745.3 million for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.65%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $759 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Verisk shares have lost about 20.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Verisk?While Verisk has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Verisk: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.46 on $761.59 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.77 on $3.04 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Business - Information Services is currently in the bottom 32% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Black Knight (BKI), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This provider of data and analytics for the mortgage and finance industries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.67 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.7%.

The decline in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to the sale of our environmental health and safety business (3E) and Verisk Financial Services, partially offset by acquisitions. In addition, the suspension of all commercial operations in Russia negatively impacted revenue by $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2022. Normalizing for this, OCC revenue would have grown 5.3%.Revenues and Revenue Growth by Segment(in millions)Note: OCC revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure.          Revenue Growth   Three Months Ended  Three Months Ended   September 30,  September 30, 2022   2022  2021  Reported  OCC Underwriting &amp; rating $436.2  $390.5   11.7%  6.5%Claims  173.9   167.4   3.9   2.4 Insurance  610.1   557.9   9.4   5.3 Energy and Specialized Markets  135.2   165.9   (18.5)  2.5 Financial Services  —   35.2   (100.0)  - Revenues $745.3  $759.0   (1.8)  4.8           Revenue Growth   Nine Months Ended  Nine Months Ended   September 30,  September 30, 2022   2022  2021  Reported  OCC Underwriting &amp; rating $1,290.0  $1,156.0   11.6%  6.7%Claims  516.5   487.5   5.9   4.1 Insurance  1,806.5   1,643.5   9.9   5.9 Energy and Specialized Markets  423.0   484.4   (12.7)  1.8 Financial Services  37.6   104.7   (64.1)  - Revenues $2,267.1  $2,232.6   1.5   5.1 Insurance segment revenues grew 9.4% in the third quarter and 5.3% on an OCC basis.Underwriting and rating revenues increased 11.7% in the quarter and 6.5% on an OCC basis, resulting primarily from annual increases in price derived from continued enhancements to the content of the solutions within our industry-standard insurance programs, as well as selling expanded solutions to existing customers in commercial and personal lines. In addition, extreme events solutions and life solutions contributed to the growth.Claims revenues grew 3.9% in the quarter and 2.4% on an OCC basis, resulting primarily from growth in our claims analytics solutions and modest growth in our repair cost estimation solutions, offset by a tough comparison to a more active storm season in the prior year.Energy and Specialized Markets segment revenue decreased 18.5% in the quarter and increased 2.5% on an OCC basis. The decline in revenue was primarily due to the sale of the 3E business that closed on March 11, 2022 and the suspension of commercial operations in Russia. OCC growth was driven by growth in research revenue, offset in part by a decline in consulting revenue. Normalizing for the impact of suspended operations in Russia, Energy revenue would have grown 5.2% on an OCC basis.There was no Financial Services segment revenue in the quarter as we closed the sale of Verisk Financial Services on April 8, 2022.Net Income Attributable to Verisk and Adjusted EBITDADuring third-quarter 2022, net income attributable to Verisk decreased 6.1%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues as a result of dispositions, a loss incurred as part of true up of the normal closing adjustments related to the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services, and higher interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.2%, and 6.0% on an OCC basis. During the quarter, we incurred incremental expense of $0.2 million related to the suspension of all commercial operations in Russia. Adjusted for this impact, OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.0%.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment(in millions)Note: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Margin is calculated as a percentage of revenues. See ""Non-GAAP Reconciliations"" below for a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure. All OCC figures exclude results from recent dispositions namely, 3E and Verisk Financial Services. Segment-level adjusted EBITDA margins for 2022 reflect a higher level of corporate allocations resulting from recent dispositions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  Three Months Ended September 30,   EBITDA  EBITDA Margin  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA Growth  Adjusted EBITDA Margin                           2022  2022           2022  2021  2022  2021  2022  2021  Reported  OCC  2022  2021 Insurance $329.3  $311.5   54.0%  55.8% $337.0  $311.6   8.2%  6.9%  55.2%  55.9%Energy and Specialized Markets  40.1   60.5   29.6   36.5   46.5   60.5   (23.1)  (0.2)  34.4   36.5 Financial Services  (1.4)  6.7   -   19.0   0.0   6.7   (100.0)  -   0.0   19 Consolidated $368.0  $378.7   49.4   49.9  $383.5  $378.8   1.2   6.0   51.5   49.9   Nine Months Ended September 30,   EBITDA  EBITDA Margin  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA Growth  Adjusted EBITDA Margin                           2022  2022           2022  2021  2022  2021  2022  2021  Reported  OCC  2022  2021 Insurance $965.5  $911.2   53.4%  55.4% $973.2  $911.3   6.8%  6.2%  53.9%  55.4%Energy and Specialized Markets  589.1   171.8   139.3   35.5   143.9   171.8   (16.3)  (3.8)  34.0   35.5 Financial Services  (86.8)  12.0   (230.8)  11.4   6.5   12.0   (45.3)  -   17.4   11.4 Consolidated $1,467.8  $1,095.0   64.7   49.0  $1,123.6  $1,095.1   2.6   4.8   49.6   49.1 Earnings Per Share and Diluted Adjusted Earnings Per ShareDiluted EPS attributable to Verisk decreased 3.2% to $1.20 for the third quarter of 2022 due to the impact of the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services, including a loss incurred as part of a true-up of the normal closing adjustments, an adjustment to our acquisitions-related cost (earn-outs), and increased interest expense.

We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses: EBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense; and (iv) provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparison.Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items.Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.Organic: Organic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale) that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP). Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent dispositions, for which results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.Organic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar; accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.See page 10 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and a segment results summary and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA. See page 11 for a reconciliation of segment adjusted EBITDA margin, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses, and a reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS.

3,33c86ec3-c233-30a6-846d-3c9b3afbaa16,SCHW,2022-11-02,Should Schwab U.S. LargeCap ETF (SCHX) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-u-largecap-etf-schx-102010050.html,1667384410,STORY,"['SCHW', '^GSPC']","[Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, the Schwab U.S. LargeCap ETF (SCHX) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 11/03/2009.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $29.41 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.63%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 27.30% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.78% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 26.15% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHX seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market measures all U.S. equity securities with readily available prices. The index includes approximately the largest 750 stocks and is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -19.60% so far this year and is down about -17.03% in the last one year (as of 11/02/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.25 and $57.29.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 25% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 756 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. LargeCap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHX is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $293.47 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $366.81 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

6,52df98f2-789a-32f7-a6d9-3fd502a2a76c,TXN,2022-11-02,A Chinese chip company founded by a former Intel engineer is set to go public and test restrictions on US citizens,South China Morning Post,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-chip-company-founded-former-093000291.html,1667122200,STORY,"['INTC', 'TXN']","[Lontium Semiconductor Corp is not a household name like Intel or Texas Instruments, but its plans to go public in mainland China could test new export controls that have put the fate of many US executives at Chinese chip firms in limbo.The company, founded in 2006 by former Intel engineer Chen Feng, has gained approval for an initial public offering on Shanghai Stock Exchange's tech board, Star Market, according to its prospectus released on October 25.As China has invested massive sums of money to support the development of its domestic semiconductor industry, local chip companies going public has become a regular occurrence. But Chen is a US citizen, which could make Lontium's listing the first to test Washington's new rules that ""restrict the ability of US persons to support the development or production"" of chips at Chinese semiconductor firms.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Lontium did not respond to requests for comment.Chen, a 57-year-old native of eastern Anhui province, is among a number of Chinese-born entrepreneurs who gained US citizenship after studying and working in the country before returning to China in the early 2000s to start chip-related businesses.Dozens of US executives at listed Chinese chip companies - including Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment of China (AMEC), AmLogic, 3Peak, Starpower Semiconductor, ACM Research and Halo Microelectronics - have found themselves caught in the middle of the US-China tech war after the US Department of Commerce released the latest round of export restrictions on October 7.None of these Chinese companies have publicly commented on whether their American executives will have to seek permission from the US government to continue their employment.However, some made moves to distance themselves from their companies shortly before the sweeping sanctions were announced.Story continuesGerald Yin Zhiyao, who attended the University of California, Los Angeles, and worked at Intel and Applied Materials, sold 74.4 million yuan (US$10.3 million) worth of shares in his company AMEC from mid-August through September. Yin, 78, started AMEC in 2004. He said he sold the shares because was in ""personal need of cash"", and the company denied he had any advanced knowledge of the US sanctions.Simon Yang, former CEO of embattled memory chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC), relinquished that role in September. Yang studied in the US but has not publicly confirmed his citizenship status. The Financial Times reported that he holds a US passport, citing people close to the company.Yangtze Memory Technologies has faced mounting pressure amid political scrutiny in the US, leading Apple to eventually drop plans to use its memory chips in iPhones sold in China. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Yangtze Memory Technologies has faced mounting pressure amid political scrutiny in the US, leading Apple to eventually drop plans to use its memory chips in iPhones sold in China. Photo: Shutterstock&gt;For Lontium, though, losing Chen could be a huge blow. He is viewed as a key figure in China's semiconductor self-sufficiency drive.Chen earned his master's degree in 1988 at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after which he worked for three years at state-owned China Electronics Technology Co.In 1991, he headed to the US where he obtained a PhD at the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science &amp; Technology. He then worked at Intel for nearly a decade and did a two-year stint at Portland-based integrated circuit (IC) design company Accelerant Networks.Chen returned to China in 2006 and set up Lontium in Hefei, capital of Anhui. The company would focus on the design and sale of mixed-signal integrated circuits.In an interview with state media in 2015, Chen explained that he returned to China: ""Did you know that in China, chips are more dependent on the international market than oil and iron ore? The chip industry not only consumes the most of foreign exchange in China, but also makes China's electronics manufacturing industry lose its 'heart'.""In 2008, as the global financial crisis hit the industry, Chen said he had to borrow against his house and borrow money from friends and family to maintain company operations. ""At least twice, there were a lot of people working overtime in the office, but I am worried about where their next month's salary will come from,"" he said.His determination eventually helped the company win support from the Chinese government.In 2008, China's central government launched a project called the Thousand Talents Plan to recruit experts in science and technology, principally from overseas Chinese communities. Chen was one of more than 100 Chinese scientists in the first batch selected for the programme. The selected individuals all received generous incentives, including prestigious academic titles, high pay and visa privileges, to encourage them to contribute to China's hi-tech development.Two years later, Lontium received five million yuan from the Anhui government. These subsidies helped the company get through its most difficult period before attracting venture capital, Chen told state media.In 2011, its products began to show up in the supply chains of some of the world's top smartphone and computer makers, including Apple, Dell, Asus and Lenovo. From 2019 to 2021, Lontium's sales more than doubled to 234.8 million yuan from 104.5 million yuan.However, Lontium is still far behind its largest rival, Texas Instruments, the US company that dominates the market for mixed-signal integrated circuits.In 2020, Lontium accounted for just 4.2 per cent of the global market for high-definition video bridge chips, a type of mixed-signal integrated circuit, according to CINNO Research. Texas Instruments made up 41 per cent.""China's semiconductor industry is characterised by large capital needs and slow returns at early stages,"" said Yuan Bo, a researcher at Beijing-based research institute Kandong. ""It is one of the effective ways to solve the financing difficulties of well-developed semiconductor companies to get listed on the Star Market.""Lontium has remained highly reliant on government subsidies, posing a risk for the company's sustainability. In 2019 and 2020, Lontium received 17.9 million yuan and 25.2 million yuan, respectively, accounting for 50 per cent and 67.8 per cent of its total profit in those years.More importantly, escalating tensions between the US and China have cast a shadow over the company's future. If Chen is forced to choose between his passport and career, it could be a major setback for both Lontium's business development and stock valuation.Lontium is already likely to take a heavy hit in sales revenue under the latest US restrictions, as it is still highly reliant on overseas markets for both supply and demand.In the first half of 2022, the vast majority of its wafer fabrication and packaging and testing equipment was purchased from overseas markets, which accounted for as much as 91 per cent of its purchasing expenses. In the same period, almost half of its sales came from clients outside mainland China, mostly in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, according to its prospectus.""Most of the domestic chip companies do not have an advantage in technology or products, so it could be difficult for them to sustain themselves while under siege by foreign countries,"" said Zheng Lei, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Shenzhen Finance Institute.""If global trade frictions intensify and relevant countries or regions adopt restrictive trade policies, overseas customers may take measures such as reducing orders ... and overseas suppliers may be restricted or prohibited from supplying the company,"" Lontium said in the prospectus.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now. The global infrastructure construction market was worth $2,242.3 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $3,267.3 billion by 2027, indicating a growth rate of 6.48% during the forecast period. Infrastructure earnings are resilient and it is a low-beta sector, but the space is not suited to outperform during a cyclical economic recovery. New York Life Investments believes that infrastructure earnings will potentially outperform global earnings for the first time in multiple years in 2022. The broader equity market earnings are set to decelerate while the infrastructure industry delivers robust growth. The firm anticipates 10% earnings growth compared to the broader equity market growth of only 7%. Historically, moderating economic growth has been a positive sign for infrastructure. During such economic cycles, infrastructure has reported an average annualized return of about 18.5%, topping global equities by 5%. Moreover, during times of above-average inflation, infrastructure has surpassed global equities by 7% to 9% in terms of annualized returns. With this macroeconomic outlook in mind, New York Life Investments backed 2022 to be a good year for the infrastructure space. Some of the best infrastructure stocks to invest in, to benefit from the acceleration in the sector, include Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH). Our Methodology We selected the firms which are involved directly or indirectly in key infrastructure sectors such as roads, railways, electricity and power, water and sewerage, communication, and airports. Positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and robust dividend profiles were classifiers for choosing the following infrastructure stocks. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continues10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Denys Nevozhai on UnsplashBest Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now10. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) owns and operates utilities, transport, midstream, and data businesses in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. The company operates electricity transmission and distribution lines, natural gas pipelines, and operational telecom towers. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) is one of the leading global managers of infrastructure assets that drive cash flow. On September 23, TD Securities analyst Cherilyn Radbourne assumed coverage of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) with a Buy rating and a $49 price target. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) has achieved 10% organic growth year-to-date, which the analyst observed is ahead of its 6%-9% target range, and she believes the company is on track to repeat this performance in 2023 and ""possibly also"" in 2024, since about 70% of its cash flows are linked to inflation.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 18 hedge funds were long Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) at the end of June 2022, compared to 15 funds in the last quarter. Select Equity Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 418,087 shares worth nearly $16 million.In addition to Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to invest in. 9. Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK) is a Wisconsin-based manufacturer of specialty vehicles worldwide. The company also provides aerial work platforms and telehandlers for use in various construction, industrial, institutional, and general maintenance applications. On October 27, Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on November 28, to shareholders of record on November 14. The dividend yield on November 1 came in at 1.68%. On October 28, JPMorgan analyst Tami Zakaria raised the price target on Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK) to $85 from $82 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares after the Q3 results. The debate around margin recovery next year remains unresolved for now, the analyst told investors in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 22 funds reported owning stakes worth $136 million in Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK), compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter worth $130.7 million. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management held the leading position in the company, comprising 479,496 shares valued at $38.6 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Value Equity has to say about Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Oshkosh is typically a North American market share leader in its respective equipment types and supplies a wide swath of industries and end customers. For instance, it is the global leader in aerial work platforms through its JLG brand. It is also the largest light defense truck supplier to the U.S military, with its Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) chosen to replace the Humvee in 2015.We had previously owned Oshkosh in our Value Equity portfolios for the better part of a decade. As long-time admirers of the company’s quality characteristics, and through our diligent process continuing to closely follow as management creates ways to improve, we have once again found an opportunity to be investors.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Oshkosh include:-Pricing power stemming from its leading market share positions in nearly every business segment, vital nature of its products and industry concentration;-Diversified product line and customer base, as well as high barriers to entry in many of its businesses, such as fire trucks, aircraft rescue vehicles and defense; and-Consistent positive FREE cash flow generation, even during the 2008 financial crisis when most of its segments faced the steepest downturn in a generation.Attractive ValuationThrough market share gains, we expect operating margins and FREE cash flow to be higher on a normalized basis. Thus, we believe Oshkosh shares are offered at a discount to our estimates of the company’s intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Oshkosh, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Further innovation and technological improvements, particularly in the electrification of its vehicles, which could drive additional demand;-Continued rollout of its recently awarded U.S. Postal Service vehicle contract and market share gains for its JLG aerial work platforms;-Increased international orders for its JLTV military trucks as countries around the world replace aging Humvee fleets. In addition, further development of its aftermarket business can help improve profitability; and-Strong balance sheet can give management the ability to run a balanced capital allocation strategy that advances organic growth and returns cash to shareholders.”8. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) is a Canadian energy infrastructure company, operating through Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage, Renewable Power Generation, and Energy Services segments. On September 29, Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) disclosed the acquisition of U.S. renewable project developer Tri Global Energy for $270 million in cash and assumed debt. This acquisition will advance Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB)’s renewables business, while strengthening its North American growth strategy. It is one of the premier infrastructure stocks to invest in. Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kad on October 19 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) but trimmed the price target on the stock to C$64 from C$67. The analyst said that he expects fewer material earnings beats in the Midstream sector compared to Q2, but ""nonetheless largely in-line results"". Potential buyback acceleration could be a positive catalyst for some firms, he added.According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 25 hedge funds were long Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB), compared to 24 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 51.85 million shares worth $2.2 billion. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We are meaningfully overweight energy, particularly within North American energy infrastructure. Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”7. Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) is a North Carolina-based company that provides mission-critical air, fluid, energy, specialty vehicle and medical technologies in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR)’s products are used in medical, industrial manufacturing, water and waste management, chemical processing, precision irrigation, energy, food and beverage, agriculture, and vacuum and automated liquid handling applications. Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) is one of the best  infrastructure stocks to buy now. On October 27, Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) announced the acquisition of Everest Group and Airmax Group for approximately $86 million in cash. These acquisitions will expand Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR)’s presence in India and France, respectively. The deals are expected to conclude in Q4 2022. Morgan Stanley analyst Joshua Pokrzywinski on October 12 reiterated an Overweight rating on Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) but slashed the price target on the shares to $53 from $55. He forecasts Q3 results to be ""largely in line"" for the multi-industry group and sees most revisions due to foreign exchange headwinds. However, Q3 results are likely to give way to volatility and ""an air pocket for orders"" in Q4, the analyst added.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were bullish on Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 31 funds in the prior quarter. Henry Ellenbogen’s Durable Capital Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 4.6 million shares worth $193.2 million. Here is what Artisan Mid Cap Fund has to say about Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Ingersoll Rand is a global market leader with a broad range of mission critical flow creation technologies (pumps, compressors, etc.) for industrial and medical applications. The company’s recent Q3 results were solid and support our belief it is making the right investments in R&amp;D and acquisitions to elevate its sustainable revenue growth rate. We have been particularly encouraged by the important role IR’s products can play in reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of manufacturing facilities. With an increasingly visible organic and acquisition-driven growth capability and further margin upside from the Gardner Denver merger, we added to our position as the market appears to be underappreciating the transformation underway at the company.”6. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is a North Carolina-based company that manufactures and sells steel and steel products. The company provides hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and galvanized sheet steel products, concrete reinforcing and merchant bars, steel tubing products, electrical conduits, ferro-alloys, and wire and wire mesh products. It serves agriculture, automotive, construction, energy and transmission, oil and gas, heavy equipment, infrastructure, and transportation industries. The management expects 2022 to be the most profitable year for earnings in Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)’s history.On October 6, Goldman Sachs analyst Emily Chieng reaffirmed a Neutral rating on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) but lowered the price target on the shares to $114 from $127. The analyst sees Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) as well positioned to gain from improving construction and infrastructure demand given its ""strong portfolio of products serving those end markets."" According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 32 hedge funds were bullish on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), up from 22 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares worth approximately $135 million. Like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is one of the top infrastructure players to consider for riding the boom in the sector. Here is what Madison Funds has to say about Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Nucor (NUE) as a relative yield example within the Materials sector. NUE is a leading manufacturer of steel and steel products. It is the largest steelmaker in the U.S. based on production volume with a vertically integrated business model. The company has a low fixed-cost position due to its use of electric arc furnaces, which are cleaner, less labor and energy-intensive than blast furnaces, and this results in low total costs per unit of steel produced. Our view is that a low cost position is an important attribute in a commodity business. NUE’s historical financial record supports this view as it has been profitable every year except for one over the past fifty years, unlike many steel producing peers. In addition, the company has a diverse product and mill portfolio that takes market share over time. We believe its scale, low fixed-cost position, consistent record of profitability and diverse mill portfolio result in a sustainable competitive advantage versus peers.Our thesis on NUE is that it should benefit from higher steel prices as the U.S. economy recovers from the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company may also be a beneficiary of on-shoring, where manufacturing returns to the United States. These two dynamics should drive growth this year, and if the United States Congress passes new infrastructure legislation, that will provide another avenue for growth longer-term.""

This compares to earnings of $1.03 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.86%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurance company would post earnings of $1.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.91, delivering a surprise of 55.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Unum , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, posted revenues of $2.97 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.67%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.97 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Unum shares have added about 85.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Unum?While Unum has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Unum: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.45 on $3.02 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.13 on $12.04 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Accident and Health is currently in the top 12% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Trupanion (TRUP), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This provider of medical insurance covering cats and dogs is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -625%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Trupanion's revenues are expected to be $231.21 million, up 27.3% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The current environment remains advantageous for us and is supported by strong capital and an engaged team who continues to deliver on our purpose,"" said Richard P. McKenney, president and chief executive officer. ""Our excellent third quarter results reflect the earnings power of our business lines and our continued favorable benefits experience, positioning us well for growth heading into next year.""RESULTS BY SEGMENTWe measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of ""adjusted operating income"" or ""adjusted operating loss"", which differ from income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of investment gains and losses, amortization of cost of reinsurance, and certain other items.  Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives.  These performance measures are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for income before income tax or net income.Unum US SegmentUnum US reported adjusted operating income of $275.0 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 210.7 percent from $88.5 million in the third quarter of 2021, which exclude the reserve decreases related to reserve assumption updates during each period.  Premium income increased 3.9 percent to $1,559.6 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $1,500.8 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Net investment income decreased 3.2 percent to $170.6 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $176.2 million in the third quarter of 2021.Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported a 228.6 percent increase in adjusted operating income to $129.8 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $39.5 million in the third quarter of 2021, which exclude the reserve decreases related to the reserve assumption updates of $121.0 million and $215.0 million during the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Premium income for the group disability line of business increased 7.4 percent to $713.1 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $663.8 million in the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to in-force block growth and favorable persistency.  Net investment income decreased 9.1 percent to $84.8 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $93.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, driven by lower miscellaneous investment income and a decrease in the yield on invested assets.  Excluding the previously discussed reserve assumption updates, the benefit ratio for the third quarter of 2022 was 62.7 percent, compared to 78.9 percent in the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to lower claims incidence in both the group short-term and long-term disability product lines as well as favorable claim recoveries in the group long-term disability product line.  Group long-term disability sales were $35.4 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 35.1 percent from $26.2 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Group short-term disability sales were $18.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of 15.3 percent from $21.6 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Persistency in the group long-term disability product line was 90.7 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 89.8 percent for the first nine months of 2021.  Persistency in the group short-term disability product line was 89.2 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 87.1 percent for the first nine months of 2021.The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported adjusted operating income of $30.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, which excludes the reserve decrease related to the reserve assumption update of $34.0 million, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $67.1 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Premium income for this line of business increased 4.0 percent to $461.5 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $443.8 million in the third quarter of 2021 driven by in-force block growth, partially offset by lower persistency.  Net investment income increased 4.1 percent to $25.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $24.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to an increase in the yield on invested assets and an increase in the level of invested assets, partially offset by lower miscellaneous investment income.  The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2022 was 78.0 percent, which excludes the previously discussed reserve assumption update, compared to 100.6 percent in the third quarter of 2021, largely due to lower mortality in the group life product line, resulting primarily from lessening impacts of COVID-19 on our insured population.  Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products increased 1.1 percent in the third quarter of 2022 to $26.9 million, compared to $26.6 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Persistency in the group life product line was 89.2 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 89.9 percent for the first nine months of 2021.  Persistency in the accidental death and dismemberment product line was 88.1 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 89.3 percent for the first nine months of 2021.The supplemental and voluntary line of business reported a decrease of 1.6 percent in adjusted operating income to $114.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $116.1 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Premium income for the supplemental and voluntary line of business decreased 2.1 percent to $385.0 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $393.2 million in the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to lower persistency in both the voluntary benefits and dental and vision product lines, partially offset by higher sales in both the individual disability and voluntary benefits product lines.  Net investment income increased 3.2 percent to $60.5 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $58.6 million in the third quarter of 2021, due to an increase in the yield on invested assets.  The benefit ratio for the voluntary benefits product line was 42.6 percent in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 46.6 percent for the third quarter of 2021, due to favorable claims experience in all products.  Favorability for our voluntary benefits life products is primarily due to lessening impacts of COVID-19 on our insured population.  The benefit ratio for the individual disability product line was 40.0 percent for the third quarter of 2022, compared to 40.1 percent for the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to lower claims activity.  The benefit ratio for the dental and vision product line was 74.5 percent for the third quarter of 2022, compared to 75.0 percent for the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to lower claims incidence.  Relative to the third quarter of 2021, sales in the voluntary benefits product line increased 19.1 percent in the third quarter of 2022 to $40.5 million.  Sales in the individual disability product line increased 23.9 percent in the third quarter of 2022 to $25.9 million.  Sales in the dental and vision product line totaled $10.5 million for the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of 16.7 percent compared to the third quarter of 2021.  Persistency in the voluntary benefits product line was 75.1 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 75.4 percent for the first nine months of 2021.  Persistency in the individual disability product line was 89.2 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 88.4 percent for the first nine months of 2021.  Persistency in the dental and vision product line was 81.4 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 86.3 percent for the first nine months of 2021.Unum InternationalThe Unum International segment reported adjusted operating income of $29.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 9.1 percent from $27.4 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Premium income decreased 4.6 percent to $173.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $181.6 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Net investment income increased 11.8 percent to $37.0 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $33.1 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Sales increased 66.4 percent to $40.1 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $24.1 million in the third quarter of 2021.  For the third quarter of 2022, Unum International results were unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in the British pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate relative to the third quarter of 2021.The Unum UK line of business reported adjusted operating income, in local currency, of £23.6 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 28.3 percent from £18.4 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Premium income was £129.4 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 12.1 percent from £115.4 million in the third quarter of 2021, due to in-force block growth and sales in the group life product line.  Net investment income was £29.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 32.9 percent from £22.5 million in the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to higher investment income from inflation index-linked bonds.  The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2022 was 78.6 percent, compared to 79.2 percent in the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to inflation-linked experience for our group life and group long-term disability products, partially offset by higher claim incidence in our supplemental product line.  Due to rising inflation, many of our claims reached the maximum annual inflation index-linked adjustment in the first half of 2022, resulting in a decrease in inflation-related benefit adjustments in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021.  Sales increased 106.0 percent to £30.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to £15.0 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Persistency in the group long-term disability product line was 84.9 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 88.9 percent for the first nine months of 2021.  Persistency in the group life product line was 88.2 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 86.0 percent for the first nine months of 2021.  Persistency in the supplemental product line was 92.3 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 89.9 percent for the first nine months of 2021.Colonial Life Segment Colonial Life reported a 12.9 percent increase in adjusted operating income to $90.4 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $80.1 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Premium income increased 0.6 percent to $423.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $420.8 million in the third quarter of 2021, due to higher sales in prior periods, partially offset by lower overall persistency.  Net investment income decreased 25.5 percent to $38.6 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to the $51.8 million in the third quarter of 2021, due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decline in the yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.  The benefit ratio was 46.8 percent in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 55.9 percent in the third quarter of 2021 driven by favorable experience across all products lines.Sales increased 3.2 percent to $115.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $112.3 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Persistency in Colonial Life was 78.3 percent for the first nine months of 2022, compared to 78.9 percent for the first nine months of 2021.Closed Block SegmentThe Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $34.1 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $109.8 million in the third quarter of 2021.  Excluded from adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2022 and 2021 is the amortization of the cost of reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction of $15.2 million and $19.7 million, respectively.  Also excluded from adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2021 are the reserve increases related to reserve assumption updates of $33.6 million, primarily related to the closed group pension block.  Premium income for this segment decreased 6.0 percent to $235.5 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $250.5 million in the third quarter of 2021, due to policy terminations and maturities, partially offset by rate increases.  Net investment income decreased 11.7 percent to $251.4 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $284.6 million in the third quarter of 2021, due to lower miscellaneous investment income, partially related to smaller increases in net asset values on our private equity partnerships, and a decline in the yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 85.7 percent in the third quarter of 2022, compared to an interest adjusted loss ratio of 74.8 percent in the third quarter of 2021, excluding the reserve increase related to the assumption update in the third quarter of 2021, driven by higher submitted claims.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care for the rolling twelve months ended September 30, 2022 was 81.0 percent which is below our long-term expected range.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability line of business was 77.5 percent in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 58.2 percent in the third quarter of 2021, excluding the reserve increase related to the assumption update in third quarter of 2021, due primarily to volatility as a result of the relatively small amount of business retained.Corporate SegmentThe Corporate segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $49.5 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $45.4 million in the third quarter of 2021, which excludes the before-tax impairment loss on internal-use software of $12.1 million.OTHER INFORMATIONShares OutstandingThe Company's weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming dilution, was 201.7 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to 205.1 million for the third quarter of 2021.  Shares outstanding totaled 199.1 million at September 30, 2022.During the third quarter of 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares in open market transactions at a cost of approximately $42.6 million. For the first nine months of 2022, the Company has repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares at a cost of $137.5 million.Capital ManagementAt September 30, 2022, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for the Company's traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 415 percent, and the holding companies had available holding company liquidity of $1,079.0 million.Book ValueBook value per common share as of September 30, 2022 was $43.49, compared to $54.39 at September 30, 2021.  Book value per common share excluding AOCI as of September 30, 2022 was $59.23, compared to $53.84 at September 30, 2021.OutlookThe Company expects positive operating trends in our core business during 2022, with solid premium growth and improving claim experience as impacts from COVID-19 lessen.  The Company continues to anticipate an increase in after-tax adjusted operating income per share of 40 percent to 45 percent relative to full-year 2021.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures.  A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP financial measure of ""after-tax adjusted operating income"" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses and the amortization of the cost of reinsurance as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations in the Financial Highlights section below.  Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives.  We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.Investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments.  Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of investment gains or losses.  Although we may experience investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.We have exited a substantial portion of our Closed Block individual disability product line through the two phases of the reinsurance transaction that were executed in December 2020 and March 2021.  As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that was recognized upon the exit of the business related to the ceded reserves for the cohort of policies on claim status.  We believe that the exclusion of the amortization of the cost of reinsurance provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses.We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION Members of Unum Group senior management will host a conference call on Wednesday, November 2, at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss the results of operations for the third quarter.  Topics may include forward-looking information, such as the Company's outlook on future results, trends in operations, and other material information.The dial-in number for the conference call is 1-833-927-1758 for callers in the U.S. (access code 420516).  For callers in Canada the dial-in is 1-833-950-0062 (access code 420516).

(NYSE:TMO) insiders disposed of US$4.7m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-thermo-fisher-130042026.html,1667394042,STORY,['TMO'],"[Many Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Thermo Fisher ScientificThe Executive VP &amp; COO, Michel Lagarde, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$542 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$518. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Thermo Fisher Scientific better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Thermo Fisher Scientific Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$333m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Thermo Fisher Scientific Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Thermo Fisher Scientific insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Thermo Fisher Scientific insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Thermo Fisher Scientific has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.But note: Thermo Fisher Scientific may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

CF, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because CF Industries is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CF in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.22 per share for CF, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.19 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CF, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.14% heading into earnings season.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCF Industries Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | CF Industries Holdings, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that CF has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

If their settlement becomes final, it will put much of the sprawling, years-long litigation over opioids to rest, though cases are still pending against smaller, more regionally focused pharmacy operators including Rite Aid Corp and Kroger Co.Plaintiffs had scored some significant trial victories against pharmacy chains, including a $650.6 million judgment in favor of two Ohio counties against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, and a ruling that Walgreens contributed to San Francisco's opioid epidemic.San Francisco is not included in the national settlement, and is scheduled to begin a second trial against Walgreens next week to determine how much the company must pay.State and local authorities have said they will use the money from the settlements to combat the opioid crisis, which according to federal government data has caused nearly 650,000 overdose deaths since 1999 and is continuing to worsen.Prescriptions for opioids rose sharply in the 1990s as companies aggressively promoted the drugs, long used primarily in cancer patients, as a safe way to treat all kinds of chronic pain.Overdoses involving opioids, including prescription pills and heroin, surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing 38% in 2020 over the previous year and another 15% in 2021, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The agency has attributed much of the recent rise in overdose cases to illegally manufactured fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid.A congressional report last month put the economic toll of the opioid crisis in 2020 alone at $1.5 trillion.(Reporting by Baranjot Kaur in Bengaluru, Brendan Pierson in New York and Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Mark Potter and Bill Berkrot)]"

This compares to loss of $1.08 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 60%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this casino and resort operator would post earnings of $0.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.16, delivering a surprise of -36%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Caesars Entertainment , which belongs to the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, posted revenues of $2.89 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.72%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.69 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Caesars Entertainment shares have lost about 53.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Caesars Entertainment?While Caesars Entertainment has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Caesars Entertainment: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.13 on $2.83 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$2.82 on $10.77 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Leisure and Recreation Services is currently in the top 35% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

(NYSE:NCLH) institutional investors who lost 37% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-norwegian-cruise-line-143024413.html,1667313024,STORY,['NCLH'],"[A look at the shareholders of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 59% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$702m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 37% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Check out our latest analysis for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 11% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 9.0% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 5.5% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Norwegian Cruise Line HoldingsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. insiders own under 1% of the company. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$42m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 40% stake in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

NCLH may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Norwegian Cruise is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NCLH in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 56 cents per share for NCLH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 71 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NCLH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +21.13% heading into earnings season.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that NCLH has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

Try to spare some time to check the fund's top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Madison Mid Cap Fund mentioned Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1989, Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) is a Chandler, Arizona-based microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog, and Flash-IP integrated circuits manufacturer with a $33.8 billion market capitalization. Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) delivered a -28.13% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -15.93%. The stock closed at $61.24 per share on October 27, 2022.Here is what Madison Mid Cap Fund has to say about Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""We initiated a new investment in Microchip Technologies. Microchip is a global provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductor chips. These products are near-ubiquitous in our daily lives, whether we know it or not. They serve as the embedded brains of all sorts of electronic devices and end products that are increasingly smart and connected to the internet, such as cars, phones, kitchen appliances, factory equipment, and so on. Importantly, microcontrollers and analog chips represent a small percentage of the end product bill of materials, yet account for a disproportionately large portion of the performance characteristics of that product. Product cycles and customer retention are very long, as once designed into a product, Microchip is rarely replaced. Growth should be well above average for many years given the increasing electronification around us. In addition, management has announced its intention to return a sizeable portion of its cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.

Rising commodity costs and labor costs are expected to have kept the gross margin under pressure.What Our Model SaysPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

(NYSE:MET) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-metlife-inc-nyse-101714574.html,1667384234,STORY,"['MET', 'MET-PE']","[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase MetLife's shares before the 7th of November in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 14th of December.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.50 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.00 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, MetLife has a trailing yield of approximately 2.7% on its current stock price of $73.94. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether MetLife's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for MetLife If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see MetLife paying out a modest 47% of its earnings.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see MetLife earnings per share are up 6.2% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, MetLife has lifted its dividend by approximately 10% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayIs MetLife an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? MetLife has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. Overall, MetLife looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.So while MetLife looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with MetLife and understanding them should be part of your investment process.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Furthermore, favorable renewals and organic business growth might have boosted September-quarter results of companies like MetLife, Inc. MET, The Allstate Corporation ALL and Lincoln National Corporation LNC, which are set to announce quarterly numbers on Nov 2. Yet, increased expenses and an active catastrophe environment might have been spoilsports.The insurance space belongs to the Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification), overall earnings of which are projected to decline 7.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Revenues are expected to inch up 3.8%, as indicated by our latest Earnings Preview. The downward estimate for earnings might have been caused by higher expenses and catastrophe losses stemming from devastating Hurricane Ian. However, increased earned premiums are expected to have partially offset the negatives.Let’s delve deeper and look at the key factors that are likely to have impacted the insurance stocks during the quarter under review.Factors Setting the Tone for Insurance Stocks’ Q3 ResultsInsurance players, having property and casualty (P&amp;C) line of business exposure, are likely to have taken a hit from Hurricane Ian-led catastrophe losses. In fact, Swiss Re expects the claims from the Category 4 Atlantic hurricane to be within the $50-$65 billion range. Favorable reserve development might have enabled the insurers to counter the catastrophe losses and shielded their underwriting results.While an active catastrophe environment takes its toll, it usually accelerates policy renewal rate and calls forth insurers to administer rate hikes for seamless claim payments. Insurance pricing in the United States increased 5% in the September quarter, per the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Improved pricing, exposure growth and client retention might have enabled the industry players to generate higher premiums in the third quarter. Moreover, diversified portfolios minimizing concentration risks are expected to have boosted their premium growth.Story continuesThroughout the third quarter, business activities are expected to have gained serious momentum, which might have boosted demand for insurance products. Product diversification and redesigning are likely to have aided insurers in addressing rising demand, fueling revenues in the quarter. Also, growing awareness following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic might have continued to support the businesses.The rising frequency of travel across the world are expected to have boosted auto premiums. Also, ramped-up economic activities might have aided the commercial insurance and group insurance businesses in the third quarter. Companies with rate-sensitive products and investments are expected to have benefited from the improving interest rate environment. Two rate hikes in the third quarter alone are likely to have supported investment income.Insurance companies are likely to have benefited from rising operating efficiency, thanks to accelerated digitalization and the emergence of insurtech. Technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, advanced analytics, cloud computing, telematics and robotic process automation aid seamless operations and lowers costs. This might have boosted the margins of the insurance players in the third quarter.Insurance Providers Reporting on Nov 2Against the backdrop discussed above, let’s find out how the following three companies are placed ahead of their third-quarter earnings release tomorrow.Our proprietary model clearly indicates that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

Prudent rate increases and strong policy retention rates are likely to aid its results. However, Allstate’s Q3 earnings might have taken a hit from pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, of $763 million in the third quarter.

The United States is among over 100 countries that have pledged to cut their methane emissions 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels.Biden's EPA last year unveiled a proposal that would require oil and gas companies to monitor 300,000 of their biggest well sites every three months to find and fix leaks, ban the venting of methane produced as a byproduct of crude oil into the atmosphere, and require upgrades to equipment such as storage tanks, compressors, and pneumatic pumps.Those rules will most likely take effect in 2023 and are aimed at slashing methane from oil and gas operations by 74% from 2005 levels by 2035, an amount equivalent to the emissions created by all U.S. passenger cars and planes in 2019, according to an EPA summary.But the rules left aside how the industry should manage methane emissions from its smaller ""marginal"" wells - those producing less than 15 barrels per day - an issue that will be dealt with in the EPA's supplemental ruling expected in the coming weeks. A source familiar with the administration's plans said the supplemental proposal could be announced at the United Nations climate conference in Egypt in November.Story continuesGroups representing the owners of low producing wells have told EPA officials they lack the resources to monitor all their sites with the latest technology. They also say smaller wells often produce only insignificant methane emissions that don't warrant the cost and effort of a monitoring program.""Deal with the stuff where you know the emissions are coming from, don't just mandate something that goes across the board whether you have a one barrel a day well or a 15 barrel a day well,"" said Lee Fuller, environment and general strategy officer for the IPAA.The problem, environmentalists say, is that collectively, the smaller wells produce a massive amount of climate-damaging methane.Studies from the Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory, and from environmental group EDF, both issued this year, show that more than half of methane emitted from U.S. well sites comes from the more than 700,000 sites that produce less than 15 barrels a day.Exempting wells that produce less than 6 barrels per day would effectively exclude more than 80% of those marginal wells from the EPA rule, according to KIOGA.""The fact that those studies show that half of the problem comes from these wells shows that you can't leave half of the pie on the table,"" said Jon Goldstein, who leads EDF's efforts to regulate oil and gas operations.Industry groups have also pressed the EPA to allow companies to use new or less expensive technology to scan for leaks to reduce costs, instead of optical gas imaging cameras that can cost tens of thousands of dollars and require intensive training.The supplemental ruling could also address the industry's use of flaring, or the deliberate burning of excess natural gas from well sites, which can also lead to methane emissions.(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington and Nichola Groom in Los Angeles; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Richard Pullin)]"

(NYSE: FE), the construction responsibility to connect clean energy generated by New Jersey's offshore wind farms to the power grid.JCP&amp;L Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The BPU selected JCP&amp;L's plan from among 80 proposals submitted by 13 different transmission developers in the nation's first coordinated offshore wind transmission bidding process. The approximately $723 million in investments awarded to JCP&amp;L to build new and upgrade existing transmission infrastructure represents about 70% of the nearly $1.1 billion project. The cost of the project is expected to be shared by all New Jersey electric customers.""This is a historic moment for the state of New Jersey, and we are excited to play such an important role in helping the state meet its initial clean energy goal of 7500 megawatts of wind-generated electricity by 2035,"" said Jim Fakult, president of New Jersey operations for FirstEnergy. ""Bringing this electricity to the grid in a safe, reliable, cost-effective manner is not just a benefit for JCP&amp;L customers, but all residents and businesses in the state.""JCP&amp;L's proposal was submitted in conjunction with offshore transmission developer Mid-Atlantic Offshore Development, LLC (MAOD), a new company owned by Shell New Energies US, LLC and EDF Renewables North America. Now that the project has been awarded, FirstEnergy has the option to acquire up to a 20% equity stake in MAOD with BPU approval.Through the project, power from offshore wind farms in central New Jersey will be delivered onshore to a collection point in Monmouth County. The electricity then will be converted from direct current (DC) to the alternating current (AC) power that flows through the grid and enter JCP&amp;L's transmission system at the company's Larrabee, Atlantic and Smithburg substations, all located in Monmouth County.Story continuesIn addition to construction of new JCP&amp;L transmission infrastructure to support the project, the award also includes additional upgrades to existing transmission equipment by JCP&amp;L and other electric utilities to help support the additional electricity.Scalability – especially important with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy's recent announcement increasing the state's offshore wind goal to 11 gigawatts of electricity by 2040 – and the ability to construct the project within the state's timelines are key benefits of JCP&amp;L's plan.The BPU also highlighted the cost-efficiency and environmental benefits of JCP&amp;L's plan during the selection process. The plan protects communities and the environment by utilizing existing rights of way with no greenfield development. In addition, the use of a single transmission corridor to bring the electricity onshore will reduce environmental impacts and community disruption.The award will now be reviewed by the PJM Board in accordance with its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan process. Project construction is expected to begin in 2025, with completion targeted by 2030.About Mid-Atlantic Offshore DevelopmentMid-Atlantic Offshore Development, LLC is a 50:50 partnership between Shell New Energies US, LLC and EDF Renewables North America. The Joint Venture transmission company was formed to respond to the PJM New Jersey Transmission RFP to meet New Jersey's goal of facilitating delivery of 7,500 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2035.

The 25 students who successfully complete this rigorous academic program will be awarded college scholarships of at least $7,000.High school senior Otis Ward is looking forward to taking part in the program and qualifying for a scholarship.""Opportunities such as the PG&amp;E scholarship are essential, especially for Black Oakland students that are underserved within our community. I’m really excited for this program as it can be a stepping stone for fellow young Black youth from my West Oakland community who are striving for post-secondary education, just like myself,"" said Ward, who attends McClymonds High School in Oakland.PG&amp;E created the program, and together with The Foundation is providing $500,000 in funding through its community charitable Better Together Giving Program.Students will take courses taught by Haas School of Business professors and financial industry professionals on topics including personal finance, capital markets and wealth creation, financial data analysis and investments. African American Haas undergraduates also will offer mentorship opportunities to the students.Story continuesMills College at Northeastern University TRIO Programs recruited the 25 student participants as part of the Upward Bound program — which helps underserved high school students and first in their families attending college to succeed — and the Mills Educational Talent Search — which supports high school students so that they can achieve their higher education goals.The curriculum was developed in collaboration with professor Panos N. Patatoukas from Haas School of Business and Jason Miles, an African American venture capitalist with more than 25 years of experience in the financial services industry and founder of Amenti Capital Group.Both Patatoukas and Miles note the unique opportunity of this program for participating students.""While technology has been transforming education in profound ways, access to financial education remains within the reach of only a few. Mitigating the problem of access inequality and addressing the wealth gap in the African American community has been the driving force of our joint efforts with PG&amp;E,"" Patatoukas said. ""We are excited to make financial education more accessible, and we are committed to continue to foster diverse, equitable, and inclusive learning environments. I am looking forward to welcoming the first group of Oakland and Bay Area students as part of this impactful program.""""There is a tremendous pool of talented students who represent shining examples of future African American leaders. They must be empowered with practical investing tools and knowledge about risk-return trade-offs early in their lives. We are energized by this unique opportunity to catalyze generational wealth creation alongside like-minded partners,"" said Miles.According to Disparities in Wealth by Race and Ethnicity 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, the typical white family has eight times the wealth of a typical Black family. The survey cites a number of complex societal factors across generations, including how individual savings and investment decisions contribute to wealth accumulation.PG&amp;E developed the new program after two years of planning as a racial justice initiative following the George Floyd tragedy to help address economic challenges faced by African Americans.""At PG&amp;E, we are focused on our Triple Bottom Line of serving people, planet and California’s prosperity. However, we know that our African American customers and communities face significant challenges achieving economic parity in society, and the racial wealth gap contributes to inequality.

Still, companies need more than technology to address global warming, said Smith, announcing plans to develop green education materials including on LinkedIn, which Microsoft owns.Wednesday's study, by Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group, found that many corporate environmental leaders - 68% - were internal hires whose team members lacked sustainability-related degrees more often than not. The findings primarily stemmed from interviews and surveys with Microsoft and eight other large companies in sectors such as finance and consumer goods.It took one Microsoft employee, for instance, more than 30 years at the company moving through customer-support, procurement and other roles before a promotion to lead part of its sustainability team - a time horizon the report contrasted with an expected 11 years before humanity will have released a dire amount of carbon dioxide.While Microsoft itself has grown its sustainability headcount to about 250 employees from only 30 largely in the past three years, having the right workforce to deliver on its carbon-reduction goals remains a challenge, Smith said.""That is in part an issue for us because it's an issue for everybody,"" he said. ""Employers really need to step back and take a broader look at their investment in employee learning and training.""Companies should bring in instructors, pay for continuing education and convene on carbon-reduction strategies, he said.(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in Palo Alto, Calif.; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)]"

Neither company admitted wrongdoing.

This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Starbucks The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At StarbucksThe Founder &amp; Director Howard Schultz made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$10.0m worth of shares at a price of US$73.10 each. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$87.10. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 274.75k shares for US$21m. But insiders sold 26.96k shares worth US$3.0m. In total, Starbucks insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Starbucks Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Starbucks. Overall, two insiders shelled out US$6.0m for shares in the company -- and none sold. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Starbucks insiders own 2.1% of the company, currently worth about US$2.1b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Starbucks Insiders?It is good to see recent purchasing. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Starbucks. Looks promising! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example, Starbucks has 3 warning signs (and 2 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about.Of course Starbucks may not be the best stock to buy.

Investors are now eager to see how Wall Street responds in November, and data shows several stocks could extend their rallies, if past is precedent. Coffee giant Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is poised to benefit, as it is among the 25 best equities to own this month.The chart below, compiled by Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, shows SPX stocks that have historically fared the best in November, with data going back a decade. SBUX posted a November win of in nine of the last 10 years, with the shares boasting an average monthly gain of 6.5% -- one of the highest on the list.Best of SPX November 2022Starbucks stock is fractionally higher this afternoon, last seen up 0.5% to trade at $86.92. And though the the security added 17% in the last six months, it remains down over 25% in 2022. It's possible that SBUX's recent positive price action may be tied to a historically bullish trendline, which could send shares even higher given their seasonality potential.Specifically,  the security recently came within one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average. According to additional data from White, Starbucks stock observed five similar signals in the last three years, and finished higher over the next 21 days in 60% of those cases.SBUX Chart 2 November 012022An unwinding of pessimism in the options pits could have even more bullish implications for the security.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings beat of 9.1%.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 73 cents per share, indicating a decline of 27% year over year. In the past 30 days, earnings estimates for the current quarter have remained stable. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $8.43 billion, suggesting growth of 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to NoteThe company’s fiscal fourth-quarter top line is likely to have benefited from comps growth, expansion efforts and solid North America sales. We expect North America sales to be $6,183.4 million, up 7.3% year over year. It has been benefiting from growth in company-operated comparable store sales, new store growth and higher contribution from licensed store sales.An increase in transaction and average ticket growth is likely to have favored comps growth in the quarter to be reported. The company has been gaining from an increase in 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members.However, a decline in international sales is likely to have negatively impacted the company’s performance. We expect international sales to be $1,804 million, down 5.8% year over year. The dismal performance in China is likely to have negatively impacted the company’s international sales. At the end of third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company noted that nearly one-third of its stores in China remain temporarily closed or are offering mobile ordering channels only.Inflationary pressures and increased investments in store partner wages and benefits are likely to have hurt the margin in the quarter-to-be reported. We expect the adjusted operating margin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 to be 14.6% compared with the 19.6% reported in the prior-year quarter.Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Story continues Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseStarbucks Corporation price-eps-surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Starbucks this time around.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are just a handful of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, which we’ll examine in this article.The NASDAQ index isn’t typically known for its high-dividend paying stocks. In fact, some of the most prominent companies that make up the index, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), fail to pay any dividend at all.The NASDAQ 100 index’s dividend yield stands at just a hair above 1%, which is rather paltry when compared to the companies that make up the Dow Jones index, which yields more than twice that at 2.27%. The average dividend yield of the companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index also stands at a far more robust 1.8%.Those figures aren’t totally surprising given the makeup of many of the companies on those indexes. While the Dow and S&amp;P are known for boasting many mature companies that have stable cash flows that make them safe dividend stock picks, the same can’t be said of the NASDAQ, which features many young tech companies that are still in their high-growth stages.Those dynamics are also apparent in the performance of those indexes this year. While the Dow shot up by 800 points on October 28 and has registered four straight weeks of gains, the NASDAQ has continued to flounder for the most part, down 30% year-to-date, though it has gained 7% in the last two weeks. With investors being bearish and looking to the defensive side of the market to get them through the current economic environment, high-growth tech companies that lose money are rarely on the menu.Some of the best dividend stocks on the market can be found in the NASDAQ however, with yields that top 2% and steady income streams to support not only their current dividend payouts, but continued dividend growth as well. Notably, many of them are not traditional NASDAQ tech stocks, though several prominent tech heavyweights also feature on the list.Story continuesWe’ll take a look at all of those top dividend stocks in this article, which feature yields above 2%. We’ll also look into their cash flow situation, dividend history, and more, to get a sense of how suitable an investment they are.15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Our MethodologyThe following NASDAQ dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.

NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 Dividend Yield: 2.8% Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) are some of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, a label which also applies to Chinese video game giant NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES). The company, which develops and publishes PC MMORPGs and mobile games, including Diablo Immortal in China, has a variable dividend policy based on the previous quarter’s earnings. NetEase’s most recent quarterly dividend grew by 12% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the company’s five year dividend growth rate of 12.1%.NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has been facing some headwinds in China, most notably from the Chinese government, which didn’t approve any of its games for release for over a year as it seeks to crack down on videogame addiction in the country. NetEase was finally issued a license for a new game in September, but more importantly, Diablo Immortal was also released in Q3 after a slight delay, which should help offset any slowdown in its other titles.Hedge fund ownership of NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has slumped heavily over the last year, falling by 41% during that time to hit a four-year low. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates were some of the biggest money managers to sell off their NTES positions during Q2. William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management held the largest stake among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey on June 30, owning 3.67 million shares.14. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 Dividend Yield: 2.02% Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) raised its dividend by 6.7% in Q4, which also pushed it 33% higher than Q2 of 2021. That’s been a positive development for the company’s dividend investors, which had been saddled with a flat dividend for ten straight quarters prior to Q3 2021. KDP shares currently yield just over 2% and the dividend is well supported, with the company’s payout ratio being less than 50%.Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) deliver adjusted EPS of $0.46 in Q3 alongside revenue of $3.62 billion, results that were in line with expectations. The company also reaffirmed its FY22 revenue and EPS guidance, which called for low-double-digit growth in the former and mid-single-digit growth in the latter. With the company seemingly overcoming the supply chain challenges that hampered its coffee business earlier this year, it expects strong sales and earnings growth from the business in Q4.Hedge fund ownership of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) spiked during the third quarter of 2020 but immediately fell back to baseline during the following quarter, where it’s remained since. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors opened a 1.89 million shares position in KDP during Q2, while Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management raised its stake in the company by 150% during the quarter to 1.63 million shares.13. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 30 Dividend Yield: 3.71% American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) is growing its dividend by 6.4% in Q4, pushing its yield to 3.71%. The company has grown its dividend for 12 straight years and has a very manageable payout ratio of 62%. AEP is transitioning to cleaner energy systems that the company believes will support long-term earnings growth. Its Q3 operating EPS was $1.62, beating estimates by $0.06, while its $5.5 billion in revenue topped estimates by a hearty $750 million.Hedge fund ownership of American Electric Power Company, Inc.

Joel Greenblatt’s Gotham Asset Management and Peter Muller’s PDT Partners were among the funds to sell out of their AEP positions during Q2. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies held the largest position on June 30 at 1.03 million shares.ClearBridge Investments owns 780,980 shares of AEP as of June 30 and likes American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)’s aggressive renewables ramp, adding the stock to its portfolio during Q1 and discussing it in the ClearBridge Investments Value Equity Q1 2022 investor letter:“About 5% of the portfolio is in transitioning power companies, typically migrating from coal to renewables. We have been active in encouraging these transitions and added a new position in American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP). AEP has the fastest planned renewable energy ramp in the U.S., with plans to both shrink coal and grow renewables by 50% each by 2030. This would drive an 80% emissions reduction, while supporting high single-digit earnings growth at a double-digit return.”12. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 32 Dividend Yield: 3.48% Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)’s dividend was cut by 11.1% this year and has largely stagnated for several years, with it currently paying out less than it was in 2018. With a solid yield and payout ratio under 50%, it’s still a dividend worth considering, especially given that it should benefit from the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act. BMO Capital analyst James Thalacker has an ‘Outperform” rating on EXC shares and believes the company is well positioned to achieve multiple expansion.There was a big sell off of Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) by hedge funds during the first quarter of this year, as there was a 31% drop in ownership of the stock. Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp and Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management were among the funds to unload their EXC positions during Q1. Ownership of the stock remained flat during Q2.ClearBridge Investments, which owns 1.62 million EXC shares as of June 30, believes Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is starting to be viewed as a premium utility, as revealed in the ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Value Strategy’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. electric utility Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) was also a top contributor. Exelon is a pure transmission and distribution regulated utility business serving millions of electric and gas customers across Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Shares outperformed along with the utilities sector; Exelon is also starting to be viewed as a premium name after its recently completed spin-off of power generation business Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG).”11. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 33 Dividend Yield: 2.55% Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) grew its dividend by 10.7% this year, marking its 24th straight year of dividend growth and positioning the company to join the select group of Dividend Aristocrats next year. The company has grown its dividend at a strong CAGR of 14.1% over the past five years, which has pushed the stock’s yield above 2.5%. The company’s payout ratio is just under 65%.Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) reported Q3 revenue and EPS of $1.8 billion and $0.50 respectively, which were largely in line with estimates, though topping them slightly. Net sales were up by 16% year-over-year during Q3, including 21.4% year-over-year growth in August. Argus analyst John Eade has a ‘Buy’ rating on FAST shares and believes the company can generate high-single-digit EPS growth over the long-term, which should support continued dividend growth.There was a 17% jump in hedge fund ownership of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) during Q2. Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management built a large stake in the company of 1.14 million shares during Q2, while Israel Englander’s Millennium Management hiked its position by 1,174% to 973,277 shares.10. Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 37 Dividend Yield: 2.64% Payroll and HR services provider Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has been steadily growing its earnings for the last decade and the company is starting to get more aggressive with its dividend as a result, raising it by 19.7% in the second quarter of this year. PAYX shares now yield a solid 2.64%, though the company’s payout ratio is slightly high at just under 75%.Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has grown its earnings at close to an 11% clip on an annualized basis over the past five years and the company expects more of the same in FY23, predicting 11% to 12% earnings growth, so it should have no problem continuing to grow its dividend as it’s done for the past seven years. The company’s Q1 FY23 EPS was $1.03, beating estimates by $0.06.There’s been a 37% jump in the number of smart money managers long Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) during the past five quarters, as hedge funds become increasingly intrigued by the company’s growing customer base. Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group owns 2.14 million PAYX shares as of June 30, the largest stake in the company among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey.9. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 2.82% Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) grew its dividend by 10.7% in the third quarter of this year, which represented slowing growth compared to its dividend’s 15.5% CAGR over the past five years. With a payout ratio of just over 20%, Skyworks should have no trouble maintaining double digit dividend growth in the years to come.The radiofrequency device manufacturer is expanding its offerings across multiple markets in the wake of the possibility that it will lose its biggest customer Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the years to come. Its revenue from non-mobile phone products grew by 38% year-over-year in Q2 to account for 38% of the company’s revenue, so it’s on the right track.Hedge fund ownership of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) was flat during the second quarter but is down by 24% since the third quarter of 2020 as hedge funds increasingly shy away from semiconductor stocks during the current cycle. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management also unloaded her SWKS stake during Q3.Heartland Advisors, which owns 119,628 shares of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) as of June 30, discussed how cheap the stock has become in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”8. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 5.25% Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is a Dividend Aristocrat, pushing towards 30 consecutive years of dividend growth. Its dividend inched up to $0.48 in Q3 and has grown at less than a 5% CAGR over the past five years, but with a yield that’s already above 5%, its shares should nonetheless be attractive to dividend investors. While Walgreens’ payout ratio is under 40%, its profit margins are also slim, which could cause issues if its expansion into the primary care field doesn’t pan out.Hedge fund ownership of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) trended down heavily between 2015 and 2019, falling by more than half during that time, and was remained relatively flat since. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management owns 2.83 million WBA shares as of June 30, having 4.64% 13F exposure to the stock.Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity, which sold out of its Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2, discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”7. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Dividend Yield: 4.11% The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) slashed its dividend by 36% in 2019 and it’s been flat ever since, so investors shouldn’t count on it growing any time soon, especially with the company’s margins being heavily pressured in Q2. Still, with a yield above 4% thanks to KHC shares cratering over the past five years, it may be an opportune time to for investors to add a good defensive dividend stock to their portfolios.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) surged its prices by 12.4% in Q2 but margins still fell by more than four percentage points year-over-year to just over 30% and sales volumes fell by over 2%. The company’s revenue and adjusted net income did beat estimates in Q3, coming in at $6.5 billion and $0.63 per share respectively, but year-over-year sales volumes fell again, this time by nearly 4%.Hedge fund ownership of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) ticked up by 19% during the second quarter as hedge funds began taking a harder look at quality food producers in an investing environment turning more defensive. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintains the largest stake in KHC as of June 30, owning nearly 326 million shares worth $12.4 billion.6. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 Dividend Yield: 2.18% Closing out the first part of the list is eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), which has already grown its dividend payments by 57% since first instituting them in the second quarter of 2019. The e-commerce platform made its most aggressive dividend hike yet in the first quarter of this year, raising its dividend by 22%. With a yield now topping 2% and a payout ratio of just 20%, eBay is becoming a compelling dividend stock for investors to consider.While the number of active buyers on eBay’s platform fell by 12% year-over-year in Q2, the company’s strong profit margins should ensure continued earnings power for years to come, especially with eBay’s take rate growing by 130 basis points to 12.4%. There’s plenty of room for further growth in that regard, as rival Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)’s take rate is nearly 20%.Hedge fund ownership of eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) dropped by 20% during the first half of 2022 and is less than half what it was eight years ago. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners both sold out of their EBAY stakes during the second quarter.Smead Capital Management, which owns 2.97 million eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) shares as of June 30, discussed the stock’s poor run in Smead Value Fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Infrastructure earnings are resilient and it is a low-beta sector, but the space is not suited to outperform during a cyclical economic recovery. New York Life Investments believes that infrastructure earnings will potentially outperform global earnings for the first time in multiple years in 2022. The broader equity market earnings are set to decelerate while the infrastructure industry delivers robust growth. The firm anticipates 10% earnings growth compared to the broader equity market growth of only 7%. Historically, moderating economic growth has been a positive sign for infrastructure. During such economic cycles, infrastructure has reported an average annualized return of about 18.5%, topping global equities by 5%. Moreover, during times of above-average inflation, infrastructure has surpassed global equities by 7% to 9% in terms of annualized returns. With this macroeconomic outlook in mind, New York Life Investments backed 2022 to be a good year for the infrastructure space. Some of the best infrastructure stocks to invest in, to benefit from the acceleration in the sector, include Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH). Our Methodology We selected the firms which are involved directly or indirectly in key infrastructure sectors such as roads, railways, electricity and power, water and sewerage, communication, and airports. Positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and robust dividend profiles were classifiers for choosing the following infrastructure stocks. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continues10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Denys Nevozhai on UnsplashBest Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now10.

For instance, it is the global leader in aerial work platforms through its JLG brand. It is also the largest light defense truck supplier to the U.S military, with its Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) chosen to replace the Humvee in 2015.We had previously owned Oshkosh in our Value Equity portfolios for the better part of a decade. As long-time admirers of the company’s quality characteristics, and through our diligent process continuing to closely follow as management creates ways to improve, we have once again found an opportunity to be investors.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Oshkosh include:-Pricing power stemming from its leading market share positions in nearly every business segment, vital nature of its products and industry concentration;-Diversified product line and customer base, as well as high barriers to entry in many of its businesses, such as fire trucks, aircraft rescue vehicles and defense; and-Consistent positive FREE cash flow generation, even during the 2008 financial crisis when most of its segments faced the steepest downturn in a generation.Attractive ValuationThrough market share gains, we expect operating margins and FREE cash flow to be higher on a normalized basis. Thus, we believe Oshkosh shares are offered at a discount to our estimates of the company’s intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Oshkosh, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Further innovation and technological improvements, particularly in the electrification of its vehicles, which could drive additional demand;-Continued rollout of its recently awarded U.S. Postal Service vehicle contract and market share gains for its JLG aerial work platforms;-Increased international orders for its JLTV military trucks as countries around the world replace aging Humvee fleets. In addition, further development of its aftermarket business can help improve profitability; and-Strong balance sheet can give management the ability to run a balanced capital allocation strategy that advances organic growth and returns cash to shareholders.”8.

(NYSE:ENB) is a Canadian energy infrastructure company, operating through Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage, Renewable Power Generation, and Energy Services segments. On September 29, Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) disclosed the acquisition of U.S. renewable project developer Tri Global Energy for $270 million in cash and assumed debt.

(NYSE:ENB) but trimmed the price target on the stock to C$64 from C$67.

Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 51.85 million shares worth $2.2 billion. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We are meaningfully overweight energy, particularly within North American energy infrastructure. Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”7. Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) is a North Carolina-based company that provides mission-critical air, fluid, energy, specialty vehicle and medical technologies in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific.

(NYSE:IR) but slashed the price target on the shares to $53 from $55. He forecasts Q3 results to be ""largely in line"" for the multi-industry group and sees most revisions due to foreign exchange headwinds. However, Q3 results are likely to give way to volatility and ""an air pocket for orders"" in Q4, the analyst added.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were bullish on Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 31 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:IR) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Ingersoll Rand is a global market leader with a broad range of mission critical flow creation technologies (pumps, compressors, etc.) for industrial and medical applications. The company’s recent Q3 results were solid and support our belief it is making the right investments in R&amp;D and acquisitions to elevate its sustainable revenue growth rate. We have been particularly encouraged by the important role IR’s products can play in reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of manufacturing facilities. With an increasingly visible organic and acquisition-driven growth capability and further margin upside from the Gardner Denver merger, we added to our position as the market appears to be underappreciating the transformation underway at the company.”6.

Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares worth approximately $135 million. Like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is one of the top infrastructure players to consider for riding the boom in the sector. Here is what Madison Funds has to say about Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Nucor (NUE) as a relative yield example within the Materials sector. NUE is a leading manufacturer of steel and steel products. It is the largest steelmaker in the U.S. based on production volume with a vertically integrated business model. The company has a low fixed-cost position due to its use of electric arc furnaces, which are cleaner, less labor and energy-intensive than blast furnaces, and this results in low total costs per unit of steel produced. Our view is that a low cost position is an important attribute in a commodity business. NUE’s historical financial record supports this view as it has been profitable every year except for one over the past fifty years, unlike many steel producing peers. In addition, the company has a diverse product and mill portfolio that takes market share over time. We believe its scale, low fixed-cost position, consistent record of profitability and diverse mill portfolio result in a sustainable competitive advantage versus peers.Our thesis on NUE is that it should benefit from higher steel prices as the U.S. economy recovers from the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company may also be a beneficiary of on-shoring, where manufacturing returns to the United States. These two dynamics should drive growth this year, and if the United States Congress passes new infrastructure legislation, that will provide another avenue for growth longer-term.""

101,093869d3-c81a-340b-bb2d-3e78ae55992b,ADM,2022-11-02,ADM Announces Global Trends Set to Drive Nutrition Innovation for 2023,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adm-announces-global-trends-set-140000936.html,1667311200,STORY,['ADM'],"[New research based on ADM's far-reaching global network highlights trending focus areas for consumers around the world.CHICAGO, November 01, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ADM (ADM:NYSE), a global leader in human and animal nutrition, unveiled today its third annual outlook on the global consumer trends that will shape the food, beverage and animal nutrition industries and drive market growth in the years ahead.Dissecting the intersection of health and well-being, sustainability and food security, ADM has identified eight spaces that detail consumers’ evolving behaviors, attitudes and aspirations. The eight areas serve as anchor points to inspire innovation, ushering in a new wave of products and services for 2023.""Often interconnected, these key themes are permeating throughout consumers’ choices, demands and expectations of brands,"" said Brad Schwan, vice president of marketing for ADM. ""The desire for a healthy mind, body and soul, as well as the global community and planet, is manifesting in proactive and decisive conscientious consumption across categories. As consumers look to prioritize what is most important to them, they want nutrition brands to do the same. Companies that can nimbly evolve alongside consumers are poised for success in the coming year and beyond.""Below are the eight global consumer trends identified by ADM that are powering purposeful design and ingenuity for human, animal and pet nutrition and throughout supply chains.Expanded Protein ChoicesMore than half (52%) of global consumers now consider themselves flexitarians, incorporating both animal-based and plant-based or other alternative proteins into their diet1. Within that 52%, nearly two-thirds are defining their eating style as ""trying to use more plant-based foods,"" leading to more demand for expanded protein options1. As technology natives Gen Z and Gen Alpha grow up, acceptance of applying scientific advancements to make our food will continue to become more commonplace, and practices like cellular agriculture, precision fermentation, hybrid products, and those with insect-based protein, are likely to flourish.Story continuesBalanced WellnessEmotional, mental, physical, even spiritual health are increasingly seen by consumers as being intertwined, and as important as each other. Consumers are adopting a synergistic approach and making intentional and mindful choices about how they eat and spend their time to address energy levels, disease prevention and overall mood and feeling. Globally, 79% of consumers believe that supporting their mental health has a positive effect on their overall health and wellness1. Plus, 48% of global consumers plan to address their mental well-being over the next year, making the issue among their top concerns after immune function, digestive and heart health2.Proactive PersonalizationWhat works for one person’s wellness may not be ideal for another’s. A ""one size fits all"" strategy for health and eating has fallen away in favor of tailored, ""better for me"" approaches. In fact, 63% of global consumers say they are interested in food and drink products that are customized to meet their individual nutritional needs3. On top of that, 55% of global consumers say they are willing to spend more on functional foods that can support their health goals1. Additionally, these personalized solutions would ideally integrate into one’s lifestyle and take taste and culture preferences into consideration.Trust and TraceabilityFrom soil to table, consumers want to know where their food comes from, who made it and precisely what ingredients are included. They want to know how the product was produced and if the conditions of its production were humane. Some headway has been made in garnering consumer trust, with research showing that 42% of global consumers have become more trusting of environmental claims made by products and brands in the last two years4. This need for transparency is borne not only from food safety concerns but also from a desire for connection with the food and the communities that grow or make it. As such, consumers are looking to support companies they perceive as honest and authentic and that utilize technology like QR codes or blockchain to allow the traceability of products and ingredients to their origins.Earth-Friendly ProductionGlobally, 49% of consumers claim to have changed their diet in the last two years to lead a more environmentally friendly lifestyle4. They’re also demanding a higher standard from the companies they purchase from regarding their environmentally conscious practices. Consumers are greatly focusing on reducing their own food waste4, and they will expect the same from the brands they support. Consumers want proof of environmental rebuilding and restoration, as well.Social ImpactUsing their voices and their purchasing power, consumers are demanding that companies practice fair and humane treatment of the people and animals involved in every aspect of production. Almost 30% of global consumers have actively boycotted a product or brand because of its ethical credentials, and 40% seek out brands that guarantee farmers have been treated in an ethical manner4. Ensuring workers’ and farmers’ livelihoods, employing inclusivity and diversity methods throughout the organization, and keeping products affordable and accessible to the end user are all important considerations to modern consumers when making purchasing decisions.Modern Pet ParentingFor many, pets are part of the family, and their nutritional and emotional needs are being treated on par with their owners. In light of this, many pet parents require that their pets’ food be made from the same ingredients as their own. Plus, as consumers pay increased attention to the well-being of their pets, branded health ingredients are highly sought-after, with more than 60% of global cat and dog owners saying that branded health ingredients for their pets are important5. This increasing personification of pets is leading to a holistic approach to pet care, with mental well-being, gut health, exercise and diet considerations all being made in conjunction with one another.Experiential EatingIncreasingly, global consumers are getting more adventurous with their food, as 74% express a desire to try new flavors from around the world and 63% report they like to be experimental when cooking6. While seeking out new and interesting flavor profiles, eaters also want to engage with fun and playful brands as part of the experience. If those brands can encourage participation through co-creation and virtual experiences, loyalty can be won with the sense of community it creates and the entertainment it provides.From health and wellness for both people and their pets, to environmental considerations and elevated consumption occasions, these eight trend spaces present opportunities for innovative forward-thinking companies to meet the evolving needs of consumers today.

The beverage company is anticipated to have witnessed revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.65 billion, indicating growth of 16.7% from that reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for earnings of 58 cents per share suggests a decline of 7.9% from 63 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark has moved down 3.3% in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 25%. It has delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMonster Beverage Corporation price-eps-surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation QuoteKey Factors to NoteMonster Beverage has been witnessing inflationary operational costs for aluminum cans, shipping, freight and other inputs. Elevated ingredients and other import costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, are likely to have been concerning. These are likely to have dented the company’s margins in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s bottom line is expected to have been impacted by the global supply-chain challenges, including the lack of adequate shipping containers and port congestion. This, in turn, is likely to have led to shortages of certain ingredients and finished products. Also, the company has been reeling under a significant rise in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs.However, Monster Beverage has been undertaking actions to navigate through the challenges by decreasing its reliance on imported cans. The company has been purchasing aluminum cans from local sources in the United States and EMEA. It has also rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long-distance freight to meet consumer demand.MNST has been implementing pricing actions to overcome the ongoing cost pressures. On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management announced implementing price increases in certain international markets in the second half of 2022. It said that some of these would be in addition to price increases implemented earlier this year in order to mitigate inflationary cost pressures.Continued strong demand for the energy drinks category, driven by growth in Monster Energy, and strength in Strategic and Affordable energy brands, remains a major driver. The company remains committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. Product launches across the Monster family are likely to have boosted the company's overall performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, it remains on track to launch a number of products and product lines in the domestic and international markets throughout 2022. This is expected to have aided revenues in the third quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Monster Beverage this time around.

HST may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Host Hotels is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for HST in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 40 cents per share for HST, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for HST, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.71% heading into earnings season.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc.

The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus negatively impacted revenue by approximately three percentage points, while Argentina inflation benefited revenue by approximately one percentage point.GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $0.45, compared to $0.57 in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP EPS was primarily due to lower operating profit, partially offset by a lower effective GAAP tax rate and lower share count.Adjusted EPS in the third quarter was $0.42, compared to $0.63 in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS was driven by lower operating profit and a higher adjusted effective tax rate, partially offset by lower share count. For a full reconciliation between GAAP and Adjusted metrics, please see the ""Non-GAAP Measures"" section of this press release.In the prior year period, Business Solutions contributed approximately $0.09 to GAAP and adjusted EPS, while operations in Russia and Belarus contributed approximately $0.06 to GAAP and adjusted EPS.""While third quarter performance was in-line with our prior outlook, it remains below our expectations for longer term results. We remain on track to meet our full year financial outlook,"" said Devin McGranahan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Union.Story continuesMcGranahan added, ""As a company, we remain focused on execution of our ‘Evolve 2025’ strategy that we shared at Investor Day. While our digital business slowed and performed below our longer-term expectations in the quarter, we were pleased with early positive results of our revised marketing strategy as U.S. outbound new digital customer acquisition accelerated to double-digit growth in the month of September.""Interim Chief Financial Officer Matt Cagwin stated, ""Europe and CIS continued to be the largest drag on results as the epicenter of the conflict in Ukraine. In North America, we saw quarterly sequential improvement in transactions and new customers driven by our enhanced marketing program, while our business in Latin America and Caribbean continued to perform solidly in the quarter.""Q3 Business HighlightsC2C revenues declined 11% on a reported basis, or 8% constant currency, while transactions declined 12% compared to the prior year period. The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus negatively impacted C2C revenue and transactions by 3% and 9%, respectively. Regionally, transaction declines in Europe and CIS, North America, APAC, and MEASA were partially offset by transaction growth in LACA.Digital money transfer revenues declined 12% on a reported basis, or 9% constant currency, while transactions declined 20%. Digital money transfer represented 24% and 34% of total C2C revenues and transactions, respectively. The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus negatively impacted digital money transfer revenue and transactions by 7% and 22%, respectively.Branded Digital revenue declined 8% on a reported basis, or 5% constant currency on transaction declines of 1%. The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus negatively impacted both Branded Digital revenue and transactions by 2% in the quarter.Q3 Financial HighlightsGAAP operating margin in the quarter was 21.3%, compared to 24.8% in the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin was 20.6% compared to 25.2% in the prior year period, with the prior year positively impacted by 90 basis points from the inclusion of Business Solutions. The decrease in the adjusted operating margin in the quarter was primarily due to lower revenue and increased strategic investments in technology and marketing.The GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 10.2%, compared to 20.2% in the prior year period, and the decrease was primarily due to changes in discrete tax items offset by the sale of Business Solutions and the Company's decision to suspend its operations in Russia and Belarus. The adjusted effective tax rate was 15.5% in the quarter, compared to 13.7% in the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of higher taxed earnings and the effects of changes in U.S. tax rules.Cash flow from operating activities was $522 million year-to-date. The Company returned $450 million to shareholders year-to-date, consisting of $273 million in dividends and $177 million of share repurchases.2022 OutlookToday, the Company reaffirmed its full year 2022 financial outlook provided on August 3, 2022. The outlook assumes current macroeconomic conditions will continue for the remainder of the year.During the third quarter, the Company agreed with Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC to complete the divestiture of Business Solutions in three closings instead of two, the first of which occurred on March 1, 2022. GAAP figures reflect an expected partial year of Business Solutions ownership, including contractual payments to the buyers, representing profits between the first and third closings, associated divestiture and acquisition costs, exit costs, and an estimated pre-tax gain of approximately $274 million of which $151 million was recognized year-to-date. The second closing, which includes the United Kingdom operations, is currently expected to occur in December 2022, pending required regulatory approvals, and which will result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $93 million, subject to regulatory capital adjustments. The third closing, which includes the European Union operations, is currently expected to occur in the first quarter of 2023, pending required regulatory approvals, at which time the remainder of the gain will be recognized, subject to regulatory capital adjustments.Adjusted revenue growth and operating margin exclude contributions from Business Solutions. In addition, adjusted operating margin excludes associated divestiture and acquisition costs, Business Solutions exit costs, and costs related to the exit from Russia and Belarus. The adjusted effective tax rate and EPS exclude the expected gain on sale of Business Solutions, acquisition and divestiture costs, Business Solutions exit costs, exit costs from Russia and Belarus, and the reversal of uncertain tax positions.The 2022 outlook is as follows:RevenueGAAP: approximately -11% to -13%Adjusted (constant currency, excluding the impact of Argentina inflation and proforma for the planned sale of Business Solutions): mid-single digit declineOperating Profit MarginGAAP and Adjusted: a range of 20% to 21%Effective Tax RateGAAP: approximately 20%Adjusted: mid-teens rangeEPSGAAP: $2.18 - $2.28Adjusted: $1.75 - $1.85Non-GAAP MeasuresWestern Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year.Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the ""Investor Relations"" section of the Company’s website at https://ir.westernunion.com.Adjusted constant currency revenue growth metrics for 2022 exclude contributions from Business Solutions. Adjusted operating profit metrics for 2022 exclude contributions from Business Solutions, acquisition and divestiture costs, Russia and Belarus exit costs, and Business Solutions exit costs. The adjusted effective tax rate and EPS metrics for 2022 exclude the expected gain on sale of Business Solutions, acquisition and divestiture costs, Business Solutions exit costs, exit costs from Russia and Belarus, and the reversal of uncertain tax positions.Adjusted constant currency revenue growth metrics for 2021 exclude contributions from Business Solutions. Adjusted operating profit metrics for 2021 periods exclude acquisition and divestiture costs. Adjusted tax rate and earnings per share metrics for 2021 periods exclude the following items and the related taxes, as applicable: acquisition and divestiture costs, the impact from the gain on an investment sale, debt retirement expenses, Business Solutions change in permanent reinvestment tax assertion, and non-cash expenses associated with the termination of the Company’s pension plan.Additional StatisticsAdditional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release.All amounts included in the supplemental tables to this press release are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted.

This compares to FFO of $3.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1.37%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this shopping mall real estate investment trust would post FFO of $2.91 per share when it actually produced FFO of $2.96, delivering a surprise of 1.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Simon Property , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $1.32 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.3 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Simon Property shares have lost about 31.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Simon Property?While Simon Property has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Simon Property: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $3.10 on $1.36 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.65 on $5.23 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Retail is currently in the bottom 48% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Realty Income Corp.

(NYSE:PPG) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 82% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-inc-nyse-ppg-175450387.html,1667325290,STORY,['PPG'],"[Every investor in PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of PPG Industries, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for PPG Industries ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PPG Industries?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that PPG Industries does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see PPG Industries' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PPG Industries. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PPG IndustriesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that PPG Industries, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$44m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in PPG Industries. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for PPG Industries  you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

He believes investors will begin to re-engage in the name.Credit Suisse analyst Timothy Chiodo reiterated Neutral and cut the price target from $145 to $135.He hailed the FY22 margin guidance hike, margin beat for the quarter, higher Merchant yield, AOF in the implementation pipeline, and substantial revenue improvement in Spain, Central Europe, and Southeast Asia.Price Action: GPN shares traded higher by 0.19% at $114.48 on the last check Tuesday.Latest Ratings for GPNDateFirmActionFromToFeb 2022Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-WeightFeb 2022RosenblattMaintainsBuyFeb 2022Raymond JamesMaintainsOutperformView More Analyst Ratings for GPNView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaGlobal Payments Registers 3% Adjusted Net Revenue Growth In Q3Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

However, both metrics decreased on a year-over-year basis.Shares of the company fell 3.7% in the after-hours trading session on Oct 31. Despite experiencing demand and margin recovery in the Specialized Products segment, net sales declined due to a stable U.S. bedding market and slowness in other markets such as European bedding, home furniture, work furniture, and steel.President and CEO of Leggett, Mitch Dolloff, said, ""Third quarter earnings per share were slightly better than expected primarily due to incentive compensation adjustments. At the midpoint of guidance, fourth quarter is now expected to be slightly lower than third quarter primarily due to further reductions in steel rod production in response to the slowing steel market.”Quarter in DetailsLeggett reported adjusted earnings of 52 cents per share, which topped the consensus estimate of 49 cents by 6.1% but decreased 26.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 71 cents. Global economic conditions and their effect on the consumer affected the bottom line.Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLeggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated Quote Net trade sales totaled $1.29 billion, surpassing the consensus mark of $1.23 billion by 5.1% but declined 2% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. Organic sales were down 3% year over year. Raw material-related selling prices added 8% to sales growth and Hydraulic Cylinders and Textile acquisitions (completed in August), net of small divestitures, contributed 1% to the positives. Yet, a volume decline of 8% and a currency impact of 3% offset the positives.Adjusted EBIT declined 21% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $113.2 million. The downside was caused due to volume declines and lower overhead absorption from reduced production, and operational inefficiencies in Specialty Foam, partially offset by metal margin expansion.Adjusted EBIT margin contracted 220 basis points (bps) to 8.7% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Adjusted EBITDA margin also declined 230 bps to 12.2%.Story continuesSegment DetailsNet trade sales in Bedding Products (excluding intersegment sales) decreased 12% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $582 million. A volume decline of 20% was caused by softness in the United States and European demand, partially offset by strong trade demand in Steel Rod and Drawn Wire businesses. Increased prices contributed 9% despite a 1% decline from currency fluctuation. Organically, sales were down 12% year over year.Adjusted EBIT margin fell 470 bps at 7.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin also fell 430 bps year over year to 12%.The Specialized Products segment's trade sales rose 24% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to $291.3 million. Sales growth in Automotive, Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders helped volume increase by 22%. Favorable selling price added 5% to sales and Hydraulic Cylinders acquisition contributed 5%. Currency impact lowered sales by 8%. Organically, sales were up 19% year over year.EBIT margin improved 120 bps to 10.7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin plunged 40 bps year over year to 14.1%.Trade sales in the Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment remained flat from the prior-year quarter’s level to $421.1 million. Volume was down 6%, mainly due to declines in Home Furniture, Fabric Converting and Flooring, more than offset by growth in Geo Components and Work Furniture. Raw material-related selling price added 7% to sales, but currency declined sales 1%. Organically, sales were flat year over year.EBIT margin of 9.1% was down 70 bps from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin also contracted 80 bps to 10.4%.FinancialsAs of Sep 30, 2022, the company had $1 billion in liquidity. It had $226.2 million of cash and equivalents in September-end compared with $361.7 million at 2021-end. Long-term debt at the third quarter-end was $2.13 billion, up from $1.79 from 2021-end. The trailing 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.63.Cash from operations for the third quarter totaled $65 million versus $50 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $25 million in the third quarter.At the end of the third quarter, it had 132.6 million outstanding under the repurchase program as it bought back 0.1 million shares from its common stock for an average price of $38.42.Q4 GuidanceFor the fourth quarter, net sales are expected to be $1.15–$1.25 billion and earnings per share are anticipated to be between 42 cents and 57 cents. In fourth-quarter 2021, it reported net sales of $1.333 billion and earnings per share of 77 cents.2022 GuidanceOwing to the lower demand levels and challenging macroeconomic environment, Leggett lowered its 2022 guidance on Oct 10.Leggett now expects sales in the range of $5.1–$5.2 billion versus $5.2–$5.4 billion expected earlier. This indicates year-over-year flat to 2% growth from 2-6% estimated earlier. The raw material-related price increase, net of currency impact, is likely to offset high single-digit volume decline. Sales are likely to be down mid-teens in Bedding Products, up low double digits in Specialized Products and down by low single digits in Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment. Acquisitions, net of small divestitures, are expected to add nearly 1% to sales.Earnings are now expected to be between $2.30 and $2.45 per share, down from a prior expectation of $2.65-$2.80. The company now expects an EBIT margin of 9.5-10% (lower than the previous projection of 10.5-10.7%).Capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization costs, and operating cash flow are estimated at $115 million, $180 million, and $400–450 million versus $130 million, $200 million, and $550–600 million expected earlier, respectively. Dividend and net interest expenses are likely to be $230 million and $80 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year is projected at 23%.

(RCM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/r1-rcm-inc-rcm-earnings-140102876.html,1667311262,STORY,"['RCM', 'APTV']","[The market expects R1 RCM Inc. (RCM) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 8, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +120%.Revenues are expected to be $522.29 million, up 37.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.48% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for R1 RCM Inc.For R1 RCM Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that R1 RCM Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that R1 RCM Inc. Would post earnings of $0.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.13, delivering a surprise of +225%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.R1 RCM Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Technology Services industry, Aptiv PLC (APTV) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.04 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +173.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $4.28 billion, up 17.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Aptiv PLC has been revised 1.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.24%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aptiv PLC will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to FFO of $0.39 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.41 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.41, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates just once.Four Corners Property , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $56.01 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $50.71 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Four Corners Property shares have lost about 12.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Four Corners Property?While Four Corners Property has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Four Corners Property: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.42 on $55.07 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.64 on $212.57 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the bottom 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Ventas (VTR), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This seniors housing real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.1%.

The investment includes $60 million to expand the plant's capacity by roughly 100 million eight-ounce bottles each year.U.S. retailers have been rationing formula and putting it behind lock-and-key due to a severe shortage stemming from the closure of a Sturgis, Michigan, Abbott Laboratories plant earlier this year.The shortage has improved in recent months, with about 87% of powder baby formula in stock the week ending Oct. 23, up from about 69% three months ago, according to market research firm IRI.Perrigo, which makes 17 store-brand infant formulas including for Walmart Inc and Target Corp, could not meet consumer demand, leading to the deal, the company said in a news release. The company's other manufacturing facilities in Ohio and Vermont have been running at 115% of capacity.Perrigo also works as a contract manufacturer for new formula brands, including Bobbie.Good Start is a relatively ""small player"" in the U.S. infant formula market, which is dominated by Abbott's Similac and Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc's Enfamil, said Tarun Malkani, the CEO of Nestle's Gerber Product's Company, in an interview.""We invested in the U.S. in particular for years,"" Malkani said. ""We never got the return in terms of scale or potential we hoped for.""Nestle has sent cans of specialized Alfamino formula and NAN from Europe to help try to alleviate the shortage earlier this year.Perrigo will supply Nestle with Good Start formula so the company can fulfill its contracts with the Women, Infants and Children program, which helps poor families afford the item.(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

As part of this strategic investment, Perrigo has purchased Nestlé's Gateway infant formula plant in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, along with the U.S. and Canadian rights to the Good Start® infant formula brand. Also included in the $170 million, Perrigo will immediately invest $60 million to expand Gateway's 29 million pound per year production capacity by 7 million pounds, or more than 100 million more 8-ounce bottle equivalents per year, within 18 months, adding a total of 36 million pounds of capacity to Perrigo. These investments are in addition to the approximately $20 million Perrigo invests each year to ensure a safe, high-quality supply of infant formula from its Vermont and Ohio infant formula facilities.PerrigoPrior to the Gateway plant purchase, Perrigo had insufficient capacity to meet consumer demand for its 17 store brand customers that sell infant formula at approximately a 50% discount to te major national brands. The Company was also unable to fully meet demand for contract manufacturing customers, including new market entrants and rapidly growing premium national brands. With this newly added capacity, Perrigo can increase supply to these customers as well as support the Good Start® brand in the U.S. and Canada by improving utilization and expanding capacity of the Gateway plant. Along with expanding the Gateway plant's capabilities to produce a wider range of formulations, these new investments will help Perrigo increase consumer choices for infant formula in the marketplace.Story continues""Long before this year's infant formula shortage, we had been pursuing options to increase capacity to meet growing demand for our infant formula in the U.S."", said Perrigo President and CEO Murray Kessler. ""But this year's industry shortage galvanized our commitment to not only invest to meet the demand for our store brand and contract customers, but also to help prevent future infant formula shortages. The purchase and expansion of Gateway is the first major initiative in our recently announced Supply Chain Reinvention program. It solidifies our long-term manufacturing supply of infant formula in the U.S., increases the availability of lower priced, high-quality infant formula to consumers, and delivers value to Perrigo shareholders.""Kessler added, ""We are delighted to welcome the Wisconsin plant and Good Start® brand teams to the Perrigo family and look forward to working with the world-class Nestlé organization on a seamless transition.""""In making this decision, we prioritized ensuring parents and caregivers have continuity of a safe, high-quality supply of infant formula and providing a great home for our people. Perrigo was clearly the right choice,"" said Tarun Malkani, CEO of Gerber, a Nestlé company. ""This sale enables Gerber to pursue new growth opportunities and focus on what we are known for in the U.S. -- our core baby food business, which includes purees, snacks and cereals.""Perrigo will operate the Good Start® infant formula brand in the U.S. and Canada. Nestlé will continue to fulfil its existing Women Infants and Children (WIC) contracts to ensure that there is uninterrupted supply, with Perrigo supplying product through the Gateway plant.Perrigo expects the purchase of the Gateway infant formula plant, along with the U.S. and Canadian rights to the Good Start® infant formula brand, to be immediately accretive to net sales, gross margin and earnings per share.

Similarly, both asset managers (82%) and asset owners (77%) identified ""securing and normalizing sustainable investing data"" as a key challenge.""This study shows that ESG is a top priority for institutional investors, but a dearth of standardized data on sustainability makes implementation difficult,"" said Paul Fahey, head of Investment Data Science (IDS) at Northern Trust. ""Digital innovation is transforming the investment landscape and advances in data science can be a key development in helping asset owners and managers make sense of increasing volumes of data across the ESG spectrum.""The study found that while most asset owners and managers are prioritizing ESG initiatives, various complexities remain. When asked what their greatest ESG needs are for their investing practices, asset managers (76%) cited internal reporting and data, with nearly half of surveyed asset owners (40%) sharing this notion. Continuing this trend, the study found that both asset owners and managers identified analytical service needs and data solutions as a top challenge.Story continues""Sustainable investing is the driver behind a number of initiatives that require greater monitoring and analysis of material risks and disclosures,"" said Jeff Greaney, Lead Product Manager of Accounting, Analytics, and Derivatives at Northern Trust. ""Recognizing this, we've developed a suite of analytical solutions, available through our Investment Risk and Analytical Services group's ‘ESG Insights’ product suite, that can provide insights to help clients meet their ESG responsibilities.""In a rapidly shifting regulatory environment, the need for data standardization is clear: the study found that asset manager (83%) and asset owner (67%) survey respondents cited ""regulatory compliance"" as one of their top challenges. Interestingly, 95% of asset managers said that they understood all or most of the relevant regulations, while 60% of surveyed asset owners shared this sentiment, signaling a need for stronger clarity around data requirements as ESG continues to become increasingly mainstream.The white paper ESG’s Imprint on Institutional Investing can be accessed here.About Northern TrustNorthern Trust Corporation (Nasdaq: NTRS) is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking to corporations, institutions, affluent families and individuals.

The metric excludes catastrophe losses, and a ratio below 100 signifies that the insurer earns more from premiums than it pays out in claims.The results also come after AIG's life insurance and retirement division, Corebridge Financial, raised $1.68 billion in September in the biggest initial public offering so far this year.(Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)]"

(NYSE: AIG) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022.AIG Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer Peter Zaffino said: ""AIG had another very strong quarter of financial performance, driven by our successful execution of strategic priorities, and highlighted by the initial public offering of Corebridge, another major accomplishment by our team, as well as continued profitable underwriting results and decreased volatility in General Insurance. These results are even more impressive when viewed against the backdrop of a challenging macro-economic environment and one of the largest insured-loss hurricanes in U.S. history.""The Corebridge IPO was completed in mid-September and I am very pleased with the successful outcome, which represented a critical milestone for AIG and Corebridge that enables both companies to continue to drive growth and value as market leaders in their respective industries.""General Insurance once again delivered outstanding improvement and absolute financial performance building on our momentum over the last few years. The 210-basis point improvement in the accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs* to 88.4%, marked the 17th consecutive quarter of improvement. North America Commercial overall rate increased 9%, excluding Workers’ Compensation, in the third quarter and continued to exceed loss cost trends. I am extremely pleased with the overall underwriting profit in the quarter, particularly given $600 million of catastrophe losses, or 9.8 points of the combined ratio, of which approximately $450 million is attributable to Hurricane Ian. The strong performance in General Insurance demonstrates the benefits of the high-quality work we have done to transform our global portfolio and implement a best-in-class reinsurance program, which together have dramatically reduced volatility.""Life and Retirement delivered another solid quarter with premiums and deposits of $8.9 billion, a 23% increase from the prior year quarter with growth in each of the four business segments. Sales in Individual Retirement grew by 16% to $3.8 billion, including a doubling of sales in fixed annuities and a record sales quarter in index annuities. Additionally, base net investment income from the fixed income portfolio started to see meaningful benefits from the higher interest rate environment.""In the third quarter, we continued to progress and solidify our excellent partnerships with Blackstone, Inc. (""Blackstone"") and BlackRock, Inc. (""BlackRock""). We have transferred $50 billion of Corebridge AUM to Blackstone and completed $100 billion of asset transfer to BlackRock with $37 billion moving from AIG and $63 billion moving from Corebridge.""We also continued our disciplined and balanced approach to capital management. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through $1.3 billion of AIG common stock repurchases and $247 million of dividends. Corebridge issued hybrid debt of $1 billion and drew down $1.5 billion of the delayed draw term loan. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, AIG redeemed or repurchased approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt. Additionally, shortly after the IPO, Corebridge declared its first quarterly dividend of $148 million as part of its $600 million annual dividend commitment, which has already been paid.""I am extremely proud of all that has been accomplished by our dedicated colleagues at AIG and Corebridge. We remain well-positioned to continue to drive excellence, deliver improving returns and create long-term value to our shareholders and other stakeholders.""For the third quarter of 2022, pre-tax income from continuing operations was $3.8 billion, up from $2.2 billion from the prior year quarter. Third quarter of 2022 net income attributable to AIG common shareholders was $2.7 billion, or $3.50 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $1.7 billion, or $1.92 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The pre-tax income increase was primarily due to an increase in net realized gains on derivative activities and higher underwriting income in General Insurance, reflecting the continued earn-in of positive rate change and strength of renewal retentions and new business production, favorable business mix changes, as well as increased favorable prior year development, partially offset by lower alternative investment income. The pre-tax income increase was partially offset by income attributable to noncontrolling interest associated with Blackstone’s 9.9% ownership interest and the additional 12.4% of public floating interest in Corebridge following the IPO.AATI was $509 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $837 million, or $0.97 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The decrease in AATI was primarily due to lower alternative investment income, and yield enhancement income, partially offset by a $148 million pre-tax increase in General Insurance underwriting results and improvement in core investment portfolio income across the business.Total consolidated net investment income for the third quarter of 2022 was $2.7 billion, down 28% from $3.7 billion in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower alternative investment income, lower call and tender income and lower returns from fair value option equity securities. Interest and dividends income improved $59 million in the third quarter with yield across the fixed maturity and loan portfolios up 17 basis points sequentially. Total net investment income on an APTI basis* was $2.5 billion, a decrease of $741 million compared to the prior year quarter.Book value per common share was $51.58 as of September 30, 2022, a decrease of 11% from June 30, 2022 and 36% from December 31, 2021, reflecting a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as a result of higher interest rates. Adjusted book value per common share* was $73.28, an increase of 1% from June 30, 2022 and 6% from December 31, 2021, reflecting growth in retained earnings from net income in excess of dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted tangible book value per common share* was $67.04, an increase of 1% from June 30, 2022 and 7% from December 31, 2021.For the third quarter of 2022, AIG repurchased approximately $1.3 billion of common stock or approximately 24 million shares and paid $247 million of common and preferred dividends, resulting in AIG Parent liquidity of $6.5 billion as of September 30, 2022. AIG’s ratio of total debt and preferred stock to total capital at September 30, 2022 was 36.5%, up from 31.1% at June 30, 2022, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on AOCI.The AIG Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG common stock (NYSE: AIG). The dividend is payable on December 29, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 15, 2022.The AIG Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $365.625 per share on AIG Series A 5.85% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, which is represented by depositary shares (NYSE: AIG PRA), each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock. Holders of depositary shares will receive $0.365625 per depositary share.

North America Personal Insurance net premiums written decreased 11% primarily due to a decline in Warranty and ongoing underwriting actions in our High-Net-Worth portfolio, offset by growth in Travel. International Personal Insurance net premiums written decreased 16%, or 2% on a constant dollar basis, primarily due to lower production in Warranty, partially offset by growth in Accident &amp; Health (A&amp;H) and Travel.Third quarter 2022 APTI decreased by $61 million to $750 million from the prior year quarter due to lower alternative investment income partially offset by improvement in underwriting income. Underwriting income was $168 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter. The underwriting income included $600 million of CATs, before reinstatement premiums, of which approximately $450 million came from Hurricane Ian, compared to $628 million CATs, before reinstatement premiums in the prior year quarter. Third quarter 2022 also included favorable prior year loss reserve development, net of reinsurance (PYD) of $72 million compared to favorable PYD of $50 million in the prior year quarter.General Insurance generated strong underwriting results, with a combined ratio of 97.3%, a 2.4 point improvement from 99.7% in the prior year quarter. The loss ratio improved by 0.9 points, driven by strong underwriting results including comprehensive reinsurance programs that mitigated CAT exposure, and an improved expense ratio, benefiting from lower acquisition expense. The General Insurance accident year combined ratio, as adjusted*, was 88.4%, an improvement of 2.1 points from the prior year quarter with a 0.6 point improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted* to 58.6%, and a 1.5 points improvement in the expense ratio to 29.8%. The improvement in accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, reflected continued improvement in commercial business mix and quality of the portfolio.Commercial Lines underwriting results continued to show strong improvement due to enhanced business mix, and net premiums written grew 2%, or 6% on a constant dollar basis, with continued rate increases. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, for North America Commercial Lines improved 5.9 points to 84.6%, and for International Commercial Lines improved 6.4 points to 80.4% compared to the prior year quarter.Personal Insurance underwriting results deteriorated as we reposition the business and continue to reduce exposures and increase reinsurance cessions to mitigate volatility. The North America Personal Insurance accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, deteriorated 14.4 points to 112.8% compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher reinsurance costs and lower ceding commission for High-Net-Worth business. The International Personal Insurance accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, deteriorated by 6.9 points to 99.9% from the prior year quarter, due to an increased frequency of A&amp;H claims in Japan and Taiwan, partially mitigated by expense discipline.LIFE AND RETIREMENTThree Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions, except as indicated)20212022ChangeAdjusted pre-tax income (loss)$877$589(33)%Individual Retirement292200(32)Group Retirement316183(42)Life Insurance134123(8)Institutional Markets13583(39)Premiums and fees$1,756$2,13622%Individual Retirement311259(17)Group Retirement142112(21)Life Insurance75791220Institutional Markets54685356Premiums and deposits$7,234$8,89423%Individual Retirement3,2573,79216Group Retirement1,8312,03911Life Insurance1,1521,1661Institutional Markets9941,89791Net flows$(919)$(92)90%Individual Retirement95696NMGroup Retirement(1,014)(788)22Net investment income, APTI basis$2,435$2,004(18)%Return on adjusted segment common equity12.2%7.5%(4.7)ptsLife and RetirementLife and Retirement reported APTI of $589 million for the third quarter of 2022, down 33% from $877 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to macroeconomic conditions resulting in lower net investment income and fee income, partially offset by less adverse mortality and an improved outcome in the annual actuarial assumption review. Capital markets volatility drove lower alternative investment returns and lower call and tender income in addition to lower fee income in Individual and Group Retirement. Higher new money rates continue to provide uplift to the base portfolio income and yield.Premiums and deposits were higher across all four operating segments; Life and Retirement achieved 23% growth from the prior year quarter largely as a result of robust index annuity deposits and strong fixed annuity deposits combined with transactional activity in Institutional Markets driving higher pension risk transfer and GIC deposits.The mortality experience in Life Insurance is in line with the previously disclosed estimate of exposure sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million per 100,000 population deaths based upon the reported third quarter COVID-related deaths in the United States.OTHER OPERATIONSThree Months EndedSeptember 30,($ in millions)20212022ChangeCorporate and Other$(583)$(518)11%Asset Management21351(76)Adjusted pre-tax loss before consolidation and eliminations(370)(467)(26)Consolidation and eliminations(192)(147)23Adjusted pre-tax loss]"

It has amassed assets over $473.76 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap ValueWith market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.06%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.23%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 19.70% of the portfolio. Industrials and Utilities round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Phillips 66 (PSX) accounts for about 1.02% of total assets, followed by Xcel Energy Inc (XEL) and Devon Energy Corp (DVN).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 7.22% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskIMCV seeks to match the performance of the MORNINGSTAR US MID CAP BROAD VALUE INDEX before fees and expenses. The Morningstar US Mid Cap Broad Value Index comprises of mid-capitalization U.S. equities that exhibit value characteristics.The ETF has lost about -7.92% so far this year and is down about -5.48% in the last one year (as of 11/02/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $55.94 and $70.61.The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 28.74% for the trailing three-year period. With about 363 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Morningstar MidCap Value ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, IMCV is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell MidCap Value ETF (IWS) and the Vanguard MidCap Value ETF (VOE) track a similar index. While iShares Russell MidCap Value ETF has $12.98 billion in assets, Vanguard MidCap Value ETF has $15.69 billion. IWS has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VOE charges 0.07%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is Phillips 66 (PSX). PSX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.PSX is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.64. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PSX's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.69. Within the past year, PSX's PEG has been as high as 2.40 and as low as 0.48, with a median of 0.62.Investors should also recognize that PSX has a P/B ratio of 2.04. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.05. Over the past 12 months, PSX's P/B has been as high as 2.40 and as low as 1.45, with a median of 1.72.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PSX has a P/S ratio of 0.33. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.34.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing value stock, take a look at Valero Energy (VLO). VLO is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Shares of Valero Energy currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 6.19, and its PEG ratio is 1.03. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 5.32 and 0.69.Over the last 12 months, VLO's P/E has been as high as 57.89, as low as 4.79, with a median of 11.04, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 12.91, as low as 0.80, with a median of 1.85.Valero Energy also has a P/B ratio of 2.09 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2.05. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.47, with a median of 1.87.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Phillips 66 and Valero Energy are likely undervalued currently.

""You see excess inventory levels at retailers like Old Navy, like Kohl's, where the consumer is just a bit tighter.""An inflatable snowman and candy canes are part of the decorations that adorn houses in Brooklyn's Dyker Heights neighborhood, Tuesday, Dec. 22, 2020 in New York. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)Hutchinson sees a far better holiday season for off-price retailers such as TJX Companies (TJX), Burlington Stores (BURL), and Ross Stores (ROST).These discount stores ""will be getting a tremendous amount of high quality, well-branded inventory really starting this quarter,"" Hutchinson said.Overall, the retail industry is entering the peak holiday season in a state of angst.Profit margins are under siege due to discounting intended to move inventory that didn't sell over the summer. And even with heavy promotions, inventory levels remain uncomfortably high, as indicated in the chart below.Too much inventory!Meanwhile, consumers are balking at price increases for apparel and accessories, and labor costs to staff stores are on the rise.Against this backdrop, the VanEck Retail ETF (RTH) is up more than 3% in the past month, beating the slight drop in the Dow Jones Industrial average.However, Hutchinson said most retail companies will issue conservative guidance when they report third-quarter earnings over the next few weeks. That could lead to fresh selling pressure in the space.""We think they'll issue cautious outlooks for 4Q,"" Hutchinson added. ""Some of it is because they brought in inventory too early.

162,71abf1a5-f287-3c0b-be98-a1cd6b44d255,AMGN,2022-11-02,Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) five-year earnings growth trails the decent shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgens-nasdaq-amgn-five-earnings-110040566.html,1667386840,STORY,['AMGN'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) share price is up 57% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 42% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 31% in the last year , including dividends .After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Amgen To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Amgen achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 2.1% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 9% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Amgen will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Amgen the TSR over the last 5 years was 82%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Amgen shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 31% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(TNGX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.3%.Revenues are expected to be $5.97 million, down 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tango Therapeutics, Inc.For Tango Therapeutics, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Tango Therapeutics, Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tango Therapeutics, Inc. Would post a loss of $0.33 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.28, delivering a surprise of +15.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Tango Therapeutics, Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmgen (AMGN), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $4.43 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -5.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $6.57 billion, down 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Amgen has been revised 4.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.30%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amgen will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Demand for most metals heightened as pent-up consumer spending came into play, and government efforts to stimulate the economy and the global energy transition also helped the metals and mining industry. Although S&amp;P Global expects metals prices to slip slightly in 2022 from their record highs, medium-term supply shortages are making way for historically above-average prices through 2025. These elevated prices will be supported by accelerated demand for materials used in the energy transition worldwide.The global mining market is forecasted to grow from $1843.33 billion in 2021 to $2064.72 billion in 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.0%. The mining market is expected to reach $3358.82 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 12.9%. The mining market comprises minerals, precious metals, and materials such as sand, gravel, coal, and stone. Asia Pacific was the largest region in the mining market in 2021, followed by North America. Remote operations and commissioning, health and safety, collaboration, and decarbonization are the key trends to watch in the mining and minerals space in the future. The industry is also relying on the latest technology including artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and data analytics to advance visualization of the production cycle, optimize throughput, lower downtime, and reduce carbon footprint.

On that day, Macy's is projected to report earnings of $0.84 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 31.71%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.18 billion, down 4.87% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.13 per share and revenue of $24.47 billion, which would represent changes of -22.22% and +0.03%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Macy's. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.09% higher. Macy's currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Macy's has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.05 right now. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 9.08.Story continuesWe can also see that M currently has a PEG ratio of 0.42.

With additional talent to be announced.Ballooning IconsConceived during the Parade’s infancy, the giant character balloons have become a signature of the annual celebration. Since 1927, the world’s most popular characters have been transformed into high-flying art in the sky. Originally inspired by marionettes, the Parade’s balloons first debuted as upside down puppets filled with air which were carried down the Parade route on sticks. The design later evolved to include helium, making them high-flying giants. Over time Macy’s artists innovated creating several types of inflatables including balloonheads (inflated heads sitting atop of a costumed participant), balloonicles (hybrid inflatables with vehicles inside) and most recently, trycaloons (tandem tricycles with an inflated balloon character).New giants joining the line-up this year include Bluey by BBC; Diary of A Wimpy Kid® by Abrams Books; DINO and Baby DINO by Sinclair Oil; and Stuart the Minion from Illumination.Making return appearances to the skies above New York City are giant balloon favorites including Ada Twist, Scientist by Netflix; Astronaut Snoopy by PEANUTS Worldwide; The Boss Baby from DreamWorks Animation; Goku by Toei Animation; a Funko Pop!-inspired Grogu™ by Funko and in partnership with Lucasfilm; Chase from PAW Patrol® by Nickelodeon; Pillsbury Doughboy™ by Pillsbury™; Red Titan from ""Ryan’s World"" by Sunlight Entertainment and pocket.watch; Ronald McDonald® by McDonald’s® USA; Papa Smurf from The Smurfs™ by Nickelodeon; Pikachu™ &amp; Eevee™ by The Pokémon Company International; and SpongeBob SquarePants &amp; Gary by Nickelodeon.The inflatable lineup also includes a new balloonicle of Striker, the U.S. Soccer Star by FOX Sports. Returning inflatables include Sinclair’s Baby DINOs, the Go Bowling™ balloonicles; Hot Air Dolly by Universal Orlando Resort, Smokey Bear by the USDA Forest Service; and Macy’s very own special reindeer Tiptoe and Toni the Bandleader Bear.Floating FantasyThe Parade’s signature floats transport spectators to magical worlds. These creations take a theme to new heights bringing magic to the streets of New York City and into homes nationwide. Conceived and crafted by the incredible artisans of Macy’s Parade Studio – a design and production facility that includes carpenters, engineers, electricians, painters, animators, balloon technicians, sculptors, metal fabricators, scenic and costume designers – this year’s line-up of floats showcase the animated theatricality that the Macy’s Parade has become world-famous for.This year five new floats will debut in the Turkey Day celebration.

173,2fefd777-2aa8-3b8a-806a-aac39cf8d026,WYNN,2022-11-02,Wynn Resorts (WYNN) May Report Negative Earnings: Know the Trend Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wynn-resorts-wynn-may-report-140102894.html,1667311262,STORY,"['WYNN', 'FLL']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Wynn Resorts (WYNN) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis casino operator is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.2%.Revenues are expected to be $852.25 million, down 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Wynn?For Wynn, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -19.37%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Wynn will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Wynn would post a loss of $0.94 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.82, delivering a surprise of +12.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Wynn doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Gaming industry, Full House Resorts, Inc. (FLL), is soon expected to post loss of $0.03 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -123.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $46.3 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Full House Resorts, Inc. has been revised 40% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 100.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Full House Resorts, Inc. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.NRG Energy (NRG) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this power company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for NRG is 36.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 39.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.1%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for NRG is 130.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 6.1%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for NRG. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 15.2% over the past month.Bottom LineNRG has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions NRG well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value StockDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.NextEra Energy Partners (NEP)Based in Juno Beach, Florida NextEra Energy Partners, LP is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by NextEra Energy, Inc. in 2014. The partnership is formed to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows. NextEra Energy Partners owns a portfolio of contracted renewable generation assets consisting of wind and solar projects in North America, as well as seven contracted natural gas pipeline assets in Texas.NEP is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, with a Value Style Score of B and VGM Score of A. Shares are currently trading at a forward P/E of 14.4X for the current fiscal year compared to the Alternative Energy - Other industry's P/E of 33.3X. Additionally, NEP has a PEG Ratio of 1.4 and a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 11.5X. Value investors should also note NEP's Price/Sales ratio of 5.3X.Value investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.62 to $5.14 per share. NEP has an average earnings surprise of 250.1%.Investors should take the time to consider NEP for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Ranks, notable earnings and valuation metrics, and impressive Value and VGM Style Scores.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company’s leading stakeholders in Q2.Ariel Investments mentioned The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Bank Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Largest Gas Station Chains in the US15 Biggest Global Construction Companies10 Most Successful Penny Stocks EverDisclosure.

They are now top of the agenda and will likely continue to stay there in the year ahead, according to a new S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence report released today. The newly published report, 2023 Economics &amp; Country Risk Outlook, is part of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's Big Picture 2023 Outlook Report Series. The new report highlighted that entering 2022, the question on many minds was the pace of the pandemic recovery. Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year dashed hopes of a smooth recovery. Instead, the conflict in Ukraine hastened a confrontation with a host of geopolitical risks and transformed Europe's near-term security and economic picture. Next year, central banks in major economies will remain focused on inflation, with the impact of interest rates adding further stress on consumers. Tightening financial conditions will lead to a further slowdown in global economic growth, putting expansions in vulnerable regions at risk and deepening anticipated recessions in Europe.""Looking ahead to 2023, European energy security will remain a source of near-term risk, clouding the economic outlook,"" said Dr. Lindsay Newman, Head of Geopolitical Thought Leadership at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""This dynamic reflects a broader trend we are watching of operational, political and security risks underpinning the economic landscape for 2023.""Key highlights from the report include:With Ukraine's fall counteroffensive and given its position to recover the territory Russia has annexed since 2014, the conflict looks set to continue deep into 2023, with few politically palatable off-ramps available for Russian President Vladimir Putin.Entering 2023, much depends on the severity of the European winter, on likely further sanctions, and on prospects for global measures being considered to cap the price of Russian oil. Economic and energy security concerns will drive short-term mitigation strategies in Europe, increasing fiscal, social, and political challenges for governments - especially those facing scheduled elections in 2023 (Poland, Finland, Estonia, Greece).Tightening financial conditions will lead to a further slowdown in global economic growth, putting expansions in vulnerable regions at risk and deepening anticipated recessions in Europe. The combination of subpar economic growth, rising unemployment, and improving supply chain conditions will eventually cause inflation to subside over the next two years.Story continuesRussia's invasion of Ukraine (26 October 2022)To request a copy of the 2023 Economics &amp; Country Risk Outlook, please contact pressinquiries.mi@spglobal.com.S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's opinions, quotes, and credit-related and other analyses are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendation to purchase, hold, or sell any securities or to make any investment decisions, and do not address the suitability of any security.About S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence At S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, we understand the importance of accurate, deep and insightful information.

Joining Yahoo Finance Now is Mastercard CEO, Michael Miebach. Michael, good to meet you in person. Last time I saw you, I was on a webcam, and it was smack in the middle of pandemic.MICHAEL MIEBACH: Hey, Brian, good to see you in person.BRIAN SOZZI: In person, right?MICHAEL MIEBACH: Exactly.BRIAN SOZZI: So a lot's going on at Mastercard. Why don't we just start with, take us inside the Mastercard of today.MICHAEL MIEBACH: So inside the Mastercard of today-- let me start off with a great sense of optimism. You know, you would expect me to say that since I'm here. But I tell you why. I tell you why. So we're in payments, so we start over with payments. We do a bunch of other things and we can come to that.But home territory is payments. If you think about the last 2 and 1/2 years, payments have never been more important. Digital payments kept us going. The whole world was locked up, and everything still worked. And that was a function of what the industry does.Payments has also never been more competitive. Think about last year, buy now, pay later. Like, headline topic. So a lot of people look at electronic payments and digital payments. Consumers get excited. They have more choices than ever. So it is an exciting space to be in if you're in digital payments, so a lot of optimism.BRIAN SOZZI: You mentioned buy now, pay later. How does that impact a company like yours?MICHAEL MIEBACH: See, where did this start? So buy now, Pay Later has been around in a number of markets, Brazil, Turkey, for decades. But there was a trend last year, really, when the world became more and more digital. Many parts of our lives became more digital because we were all at home. It was the only way to interact and more choices came out. It was opportunity for alternative payment providers.Story continuesAnd then, buy now, pay later was one thing that was particularly liked by younger people who says, you know, maybe the credit card that my dad has isn't the coolest things, so buy now, pay later where I just take one loan at a time, maybe I can manage my budget better, whatever the logic was. So it suddenly became a thing.And we looked at this and we said, well, it's about payments. So of course, we have to be in this because our general position is we like payments regardless of what it is. We believe in providing choice. If consumers want to do pay before or pay after or pay later in this case, we should have all of those answers.So for our customers, which is oftentimes large retailers or banks, we got to have the full array. So we looked at this and said, great, if that's what people want to do, then we build it into our network as a capability, which we have done. So buy now, pay later through Mastercard, enabling a bunch of banks and a bunch of merchants, therefore, many consumers will want to use this is now a reality through our network at 90 million merchants around the world.BRIAN SOZZI: If guys like you were going to get into this, what does it mean for some of the players in the industry?MICHAEL MIEBACH: You know, think about buy now, pay later PurePlace, that's mainly what they do. We can be a partner. We can facilitate more growth and path to scale through our network with them. But it also means for existing payment players like banks who are saying, all right, I want to get into this space and compete with these guys. So in the end, we like competition and more choice. And whoever wants to use what we have built into our network, we're going to partner with them.BRIAN SOZZI: It sure seems like from an outside looking in that Mastercard is moving faster under your leadership. And I point to a couple of deals, gaming, DoorDash, Airbnb. Take us through those deals, and what does it mean to a platform like yours?MICHAEL MIEBACH: Right. You know, all of them come down really to a need that somebody has. So during the days of COVID-- I mean, food delivery was a thing for many years, but it really got a thing absolutely top of my mind during the last 2 and 1/2 years. So getting into that space and saying, if that is a need of consumers, are there real people somewhere that have a real need? Then we want to be into it.And we use partners who dominate in these spaces, who are engaged in these spaces, who have idea in these spaces and technology, and we partner with them. DoorDash is certainly one. Airbnb on lodging, that is a trend. Travel is coming back in a big way. People haven't been able to travel in the last 2 and 1/2 years. Now, they want to do, so a partnership with Airbnb is right up our alley.We say, all right. People want to travel, and it should be easy for them to make those payments to Airbnb. If you happen to be a host and you're renting out your own apartment, how do you get your money? You get it via our rails very quickly into your account. So that's the kind of partnerships that we have with large players in these different categories who are leading the way for the consumer.BRIAN SOZZI: Is travel back to pre-pandemic levels?MICHAEL MIEBACH: It is. It's actually above pre-pandemic levels. We are, as of the third quarter this year at 124% versus 2019. So we take the noise out of the numbers, you just look pre-pandemic, 124%. But it's not quite at historic levels yet. So it's above, but if the world would have continued the way it was going in 2019 without COVID and the pandemic in the middle, we would be a different level.So there's still huge potential. Asia, for example, Asia hasn't fully opened up like Europe or the United States have, so more to go. We have focused on travel all along. You can use your MasterCard wherever you want. We love the travel space. And now a lot of people say, hey, you know, I haven't gone anywhere for two years. I'm going to book that trip. I'm going to book that Thanksgiving travel, going to see the family that I haven't seen, or I'm going to go skiing or whatever we do, travel. There's a lot of momentum.BRIAN SOZZI: Revenge travel.MICHAEL MIEBACH: It is revenge travel. I think that's right.BRIAN SOZZI: Talk to us a little bit about-- I talked to one of your competitors recently. They said, we're seeing consumers spend more on services than goods. Do you see that?MICHAEL MIEBACH: The service economy is seeing a massive comeback, very true. It's also very logical. 2 and 1/2 years ago, what is service industry? Is like going to a restaurant. It's going and booking a plane ticket and then going somewhere. It just simply wasn't possible. So spend was a lot on goods, it was on home furnishings, it was on home improvement. And now it's shifting from goods to services.So services, if you look at airlines, airlines spend, 40% up, lodging, 30% up, restaurant, 20% up. People want to be out there. They want to experience things and just reengage with life. So that's exciting, we want to facilitate that. They want to do it online or they just show up at the theater and present Mastercard, either way, in our model, we have all the options for them.BRIAN SOZZI: Looking through that prism of people spending more on services as opposed to goods, is there any indication inflation has peaked?MICHAEL MIEBACH: Well, you're not talking to the economic oracle, so I don't really know what is going to happen in the future. What I can tell you is, through the lens of our business, and we do see a good chunk of consumer spending and of business spending, is that there is inflation in the numbers, so prices have gone up.But we also see, this as the more interesting story, that I think is the consumers continue to spend. There is resilience in consumer spending in pretty much every part of the world. There is changes, though, in what people spend on. We just talked about the shift to the services economy.But depending on different segments within the spectrum of consumers, there is more shift to maybe necessities or less discretionary spends. We spend more on food versus back to travel, you know, that is a different ends of the spectrum. That is a trend that we're seeing. So what, somewhat changing. The absolute level, not changing. We see that in Europe, we see it in the United States, we see really, in every part of the world.BRIAN SOZZI: You think that momentum continues into the holidays?MICHAEL MIEBACH: Yep. Again, back to predictions, how to see where it's going to go. So far, we don't see any near-term changes in consumer overall spending levels. The continuation of these shifts into experiences, vis-a-vis goods, I think that will continue.BRIAN SOZZI: Are you confident in saying that, we're just not going to have a recession? You don't see any red flags in your numbers that would give you [INAUDIBLE]?MICHAEL MIEBACH: Currently, based on the data that we have, which is all past, it already happened, there is no such indication. Consumer is resilience. That resilience will last to-- we have not any indication that there's a near-term recession. So we said, well, certainly, we don't see it this year. But who knows? It's too early to talk about 2023.BRIAN SOZZI: What will Mastercard's role be in the future of crypto?MICHAEL MIEBACH: You know, Brian, earlier we were saying whatever choices people take in payments. So some people want to invest in crypto assets, for example, so buy any cryptocurrency. And we want to make that as easy, and more importantly, as safe as any other payment that people effect with Mastercard.So buy a good and it's not really living up to what it is? You can basically reverse that, chargeback that particular payment. And when it comes to crypto, same expectations and aspirations on safety, security, regulatory compliance. So we want to make it easy, and we want to make it safe.And that's how we have been engaging whole set of partnerships with crypto exchanges. So I can buy crypto easily through my card, and I can pay out for my crypto world using a Mastercard Send solution, which is basically a push payment back into my card or wherever it goes. So making that very straightforward.You look at other aspects of the crypto economy, the overall question of where's regulation going, regulatory compliance, and things like that, we have a whole set of services that we deploy to make the ecosystem safe. So exchanges, banks, and everybody else who wants to play in the space, in the end, they all have needs that are pretty common on safety, security. So we fulfill those.And finally, there's a lot of talk out there on central bank digital currencies, which is yet another angle of the crypto economy where we advise and work with governments, and we provide testing facilities. You want to create the digital Sand Dollar, the government of the Bahamas has done that. And they partner with us to try it out and see how that works.So we cover a whole spectrum of the crypto economy, really, from the simple starting point. It's an interesting technology. People have interest in that. There's problems to solve. Payments isn't as efficient as it could be everywhere in the world, and we want to be there and drive value.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you think we have that day where it's wide adoption in crypto? Are we ever going to get there where everybody in this room right now is just paying with Bitcoin?MICHAEL MIEBACH: Entirely possible, but I think it's a long way to go. Before crypto becomes mainstream, I think this question of regulatory compliance on scalable technology and making sure there's a predictable user experience. Why is buying an NFTs such a clunky experience. It shouldn't be. That's why we have a partnership with Coin--BRIAN SOZZI: I don't even know how to buy one.MICHAEL MIEBACH: [INAUDIBLE]BRIAN SOZZI: Full disclosure. I mean, we're sharing here. I have no idea how to buy it.MICHAEL MIEBACH: So we're partnering with Coinbase to make it as simple as you buying a coffee. I think these things all need to click in, and then you have the building blocks for it to become mainstream. Is that going to happen in the next six months? Most likely not. But are we optimistic and are we investing? Absolutely.BRIAN SOZZI: Last one before we let you go, I met you originally on a webcam from my kitchen table right in the middle of the pandemic. It was my first time talking to you. Looking back, how has the pandemic changed you as a leader?MICHAEL MIEBACH: You know, admitting that you don't have all of the answers. I'm sitting with you, you're asking me a bunch of questions, and it turned out there was not a playbook for a pandemic because it was truly unprecedented. So a larger portion of humility and saying to folks that you sit with, the team at Mastercard, I don't have all of the answers.But we know we've got to lean in, and we got to get the right people to the table, get a diverse set of perspectives and figure it out. That was certainly one thing. I think one other thing that this has done is the-- I come right back to the beginning of the conversation-- the believe in what we do and how important that is, that is much higher than before the pandemic.This really has shown. I mean, our industry kept the world going. So a little bit on the leadership side, and a little bit even more of a belief in that we drive some value as a company.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, it's good to see you in person. Good to see all the initiatives you're working with over there Mastercard. Thanks for coming down. We appreciate it.MICHAEL MIEBACH: Thanks, Brian. Thank you for having me.[MUSIC PLAYING]]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of QUALCOMM. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in QUALCOMM. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of QUALCOMM, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. QUALCOMM is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. With 7.3% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that QUALCOMM Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$152m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (1 shouldn't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Investors will get the first glimpse of how the largest semiconductor companies are handling high inflation with NVIDIA NVDA and others set to report later this month.The report will show the broader demand for Qualcomm’s integrated circuits (ICs) and the need for its Code Division Multiple Access Technology (CDMA). CDMA is an example of Qualcomm being an innovation leader in designing, manufacturing, and marketing digital wireless telecom products. QCOM’s stock is still holding up better than broader markets over the last year despite a lackluster YTD performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverviewQualcomm’s business is largely derived from selling processors and modems for smartphones. Last quarter, the company’s handset business grew 59% year over year to $6.15 billion. Qualcomm reported total revenue of $10.93 billion, which was also up 37% year over year. This helped QCOM beat earnings expectations by 3% at $2.96 per share, up 53% year over year.Despite the beats on both its top and bottom lines last quarter, the stock was slightly down after earnings. The decline was due to the company offering weak guidance for its fiscal Q4 amid what it already stated was a challenging macroeconomic environment.Fiscal Q4 Outlook The Zacks Consensus Estimate for QCOM’s fiscal Q4 earnings is $3.15 per share, which would represent a 23% increase from Q4 2021. Sales are expected to be up 22% at $11.38 billion. Earnings estimates for the period have remained unchanged throughout the quarter.Year over year, QCOM earnings are expected to climb 47% and rise another 1% in FY23 at $12.66 per share. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales projected to be up 31% this year and rise another 5% in FY23 to $46.55 billion.However, full-year earnings estimates for the current year, next quarter, and FY23 have declined over the last 90 days. In addition to earnings, Wall Street will certainly be paying close attention to Qualcomm’s FY23 guidance as the current market environment is still tougher on technology companies. Story continuesPerformance &amp; Valuation Year to date QCOM is down -36% to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -20% and closer to the Nasdaq’s -30%. Longer-term investors are hoping QCOM can get back to its strong performance with the stock crushing the benchmark and the Nasdaq over the last five years. This is especially true when adding QCOM’s solid dividend yield for the stock’s total return.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter reaching 52-week highs of $193.58 last January QCOM’s stock has plummeted to $117 per share. At current levels, QCOM has a P/E of 10.3X. This is well below its peer group’s 24.7X. The stock also trades at a discount to its decade-high of 36.9X and the median of 16.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineDespite trading at a discount relative to its past, QCOM currently lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in correlation to declining earnings estimates for this year, next quarter, and FY23. Although Qualcomm’s Wireless Equipment Industry is in the top 16% of over 250 Zacks Industries, investors will want to pay close attention to the company’s outlook and guidance because of the downward revisions.Long-term the stock is starting to look attractive, but more short-term pain could be ahead considering the current chip and tech headwinds.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Some hope to hear Chair Jerome Powell talk about easing off on such aggressively large rate increases, perhaps as early as December.That thinking has been encouraged by some data in recent weeks that show the economy is cooling off. Some of those hopes were dashed earlier Tuesday when the job opening number for September was stronger than expected.Later this week, on Friday, the official jobs report for October will be released.

In spite of the relatively cheap prices, insiders made the decision to sell US$13m worth of stock in the last 12 months. This could be a warning indicator of vulnerabilities in the future.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$486). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was 100% of Frank St. John's holding.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Lockheed Martin shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Lockheed Martin Insiders Are Selling The StockThere was substantially more insider selling, than buying, of Lockheed Martin shares over the last three months. In that time, insider Gregory Ulmer dumped US$2.9m worth of shares. On the flip side, insider John Donovan spent US$251k on purchasing shares. Because the selling vastly outweighs the buying, we'd say this is a somewhat bearish sign.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Lockheed Martin insiders own about US$81m worth of shares. That equates to 0.06% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Does This Data Suggest About Lockheed Martin Insiders?The insider sales have outweighed the insider buying, at Lockheed Martin, in the last three months. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Lockheed Martin makes money, and is growing profits. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We're in no rush to buy! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Lockheed Martin.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $3.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -20.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.33 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +41.5%. This estimate has changed -7.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 indicates a change of -28% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -23.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.91 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.6%. The $15.99 billion and $14.8 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.8% and -7.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.4%. EPS of $2.69 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.49%. The EPS surprise was -1.47%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.92 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.63%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electricity and natural gas provider would post earnings of $0.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.91, delivering a surprise of 5.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.WEC Energy , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $2 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.20%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.75 billion.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for WEC Energy: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock.

Medtronic is taking bold new steps to change that by launching the Medtronic Neurovascular Co-Lab™, an innovation process and platform for new ideas in the treatment of stroke care.The goal: rapidly gather new ideas to improve stroke care, identify the ones that show the most promise, and quickly develop therapies that can improve outcomes for patients.""There's a tremendous need to accelerate stroke innovation,"" said Dan Volz, president of Medtronic Neurovascular. ""A physician told me he would love to use a particular product to treat patients, but he feared there's a good chance he never will. The company doesn't have a sales organization and may not be able to bring their product to market. That's tragic.""How it worksMedtronic Neurovascular Co-Lab™ Platform is creating a one-of-a-kind system to collect and quickly examine ideas from doctors, individual inventors, entrepreneurs, startup companies, or anyone else passionate about improving stroke care. A team analyzes the ideas, then expedites the best of them toward investment in more research or development of prototypes. Eventually, Co-Lab can also help shepherd a therapy through clinical and commercial stages of development.""Physicians, for instance, know firsthand the needs that are unmet, but have less experience in product prototyping. Startups have innovative products but can often use help in understanding regulatory pathways. From concept to commercialization, we can help,"" Volz said.The need for speedThe need for speed in stroke care is critical. When a person suffers a stroke, the brain is deprived of blood. Every minute that passes kills more brain tissue that can't be repaired or regrown.When Memphis judge Cheryl Blackburn left her courtroom one day, a fellow judge noticed her slurred speech and drooping face. ""I felt fine, but my colleague could tell right away something was wrong,"" said Judge Blackburn. ""She called the paramedics immediately. They got me off to the hospital and the doctors saved my life.""Story continuesBrain surgeons performed a procedure known as mechanical thrombectomy to pull the blood clot from Judge Blackburn's brain. Thrombectomy devices are a relatively new innovations in stroke care and ""really transformed our fight against stroke,"" said Dr. Adam Arthur, a neurosurgeon at the Semmes Murphey Clinic in Tennessee and the James T. Robertson Professor and Chair at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center.Innovations like thrombectomy are an example of the type of invention Medtronic hopes will be sparked by Co-Lab.""I would highlight two big needs for innovation in stroke care,"" said Dr. Arthur. ""We need innovations that would allow us to extend the window, or ‘turn back the clock' on the time we have to help patients before the damage is too great. And two, discovering ways to foster regrowth of brain tissue. The impact by either of those would be huge.""Just as time is critical in treating individual stroke patients, the need for speed in developing new stroke innovations is staggering. One in four people will suffer a stroke in their lifetime, but currently only about 10% receive treatment. Of the 15 million people who suffer strokes every year, five million die and five million more are left disabled.""Strokes devastate not only the patients, but also to their entire families. Stroke patients can lose movement and speech, and their families bear the burden of caring for them. The need for accelerating innovation in care is tremendous,"" said Dr. Arthur.Even before establishing Co-Lab, Medtronic received more than three innovation ideas every week, with roughly half of those coming from physicians. The goal now is to drastically increase those numbers and turn the best ideas into therapies that can help people.""The good news is the neurovascular technology market is brimming with ideas, improvements, and would-be therapies in need of development,"" Volz said. ""We have the expertise and the obligation to expedite innovation and that's exactly what we're going to do.""If you have an idea to improve stroke care, the Medtronic Neurovascular Co-Lab™ Platform portal is always on.

With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 3.8% increase in share prices after a year of 26% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Medtronic. See our latest analysis for Medtronic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medtronic?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Medtronic. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Medtronic's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Medtronic is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.3% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MedtronicThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Medtronic plc. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$106m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 17% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Medtronic. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and dividend investing, you can go directly to our article This Is the Best Time to Buy These 5 Long-Term Dividend Stocks.For the long-term, tax-paying investor, strategic investment policies focusing on passive income are the ones that work the best. Investment portfolios including reliable dividend stocks have the potential to deliver strong long-term returns even if the market is unfavorable to most stocks. In addition, the fact that a company is able to consistently pay a dividend, while also raising its payouts year after year, is generally a sign that the company has stronger balance sheets and profitability relative to non-dividend-paying companies.As a result of the above, stable dividend stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have typically been among the few securities investors never grow tired of. This is because dividends account for over 40% of a company's total return. This has been an observable trend over more than 90 years until 2015, according to a Morgan Stanley publication on dividend investing. These stocks have also historically outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts. From 1991 to 2015, dividend stocks outperformed non-dividend-payers, since the former had an average annual return of 9.7% while the latter's average annual return was 4.18%. Additionally, those stocks which consistently raise their yields annually also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 benchmark in 17 out of the 23 years between 1991 and 2015.A BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund report from this April also showed that in 2022, dividend stocks comprising this fund outperformed the broad S&amp;P 500 over the 12-month period that ended April 30. Additionally, according to a Barron's article published this May, between 1999 and 2019, dividend-payers with higher payout ratios had an annual return of 10.9%, compared to a 6.6% annual return for those companies with low payout ratios.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on UnsplashMethodologyWe picked strong dividend stocks that also have long-term growth potential. These companies are defensive plays that are positioned to stray strong during the tough economic situation heading towards us in 2023 and beyond.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Dividend Yield as of November 1: 2.55%Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is another consumer staples company on our list, operating through its Oral, Personal and Home Care, and Pet Nutrition segments. The company offers products such as toothpaste, mouthwash, bar, and liquid hand soaps, and more. It is based in New York, US.Steve Powers at Deutsche Bank holds a Buy rating on shares of  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as of October 17. The analyst also placed an $85 price target on the stock.Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is one of the most stable dividend stocks in the market today, having raised its yield for the past 59 years consistently. This October, the company raised its organic sales growth guidance for 2022 from 5%-7% to 6%-7%. Third Point Investors acquired a large position in  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in October, stating that the company is defensive and had significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. It also has specific businesses that are highly profitable, such as Hill's Pet Nutrition business. Hill's has grown organic sales by 11%-12% over the past few years.The largest stakeholder in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in the second quarter was Ayrshire Capital Management, holding 48,328 shares worth $3.4 million. Overall, 50 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $2.6 billion.Third Point, a New York-based investment advisor, mentioned  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

Earnings rose 12% year over year on the back of higher operating profits.Revenues of $6.94 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.91 billion. Sales increased 2% year over year.Quarter in DetailIn the quarter, net realized prices decreased 7% in the quarter while volumes rose 14%. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates hurt sales by 4% in the quarter.Key growth products (the ones launched in 2014) grew 19% and contributed nearly 70% to total revenues, excluding revenues from COVID-19 antibodies. While U.S. revenues rose 11% to $4.42 billion, ex-U.S. revenues declined 9% to $2.52 billion.Among the growth products, Trulicity generated revenues worth $1.85 billion, up 16% year over year, driven by increased demand worldwide, which offset the impact of lower realized prices in ex-U.S. markets and currency headwinds. However, the reported figures missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1.95 billion and $1.87 billion, respectively.Taltz brought in sales of $679.9 million, up 15% year over year, as the drug’s worldwide sales benefited from increased demand, which offset the impact of lower realized prices and currency headwinds.Verzenio generated sales of $617.7 million in the reported quarter, up 84% year over year, on increased demand, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, partially offset by lower realized prices due to updated 2022 NRDL price reductions in China and currency headwinds. Verzenio sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $604 million during the quarter.Jardiance sales surged 47% to $573.3 million, driven by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes medicines in the United States and increased demand outside the United States, partially offset by currency headwinds. The reported sales figure exceeded both the Zacks Consensus Estimates and our estimates of $512 million and $522.9 million, respectively.Story continuesEmgality generated revenues of $168.5 million in the quarter, up 20% year over year, as sales benefited from increased demand, which offset the impact of lower realized prices and currency headwinds.In the reported quarter, Lilly recorded only $386.6 million of revenues from COVID-19 therapies, up 78% year-over-year.Olumiant (baricitinib) generated sales of $182.9 million in the third quarter, down 55% on a year-over-year basis, on account of lower utilization of the medicine in COVID-19 treatment as the impact of the pandemic reduces. Lilly markets Olumiant in partnership with Incyte.Cyramza revenues of $232.1 million were down 8% year over year. Basaglar recorded revenues of $193 million, flat year over year.Tyvyt revenues in China were $76.8 million, down 39% year over year due to lower realized prices due to updated 2022 NRDL price reductions in China and increased competition. Lilly markets Tyvyt in partnership with Innovent.Among the newer drugs, the cancer drug Retevmo generated sales of $40.5 million, up 21% year over year.The recently approved diabetes drug, Mounjaro, recorded $187.3 million during the quarter, much higher than $16.0 million recorded in the previous quarter. While Mounjaro generated $97.3 million in product sales in the United States, Lilly recorded $86 million from sale of the drug’s selling rights to a Japanese distributor. The reported sales figures exceeded our estimate of $75 million for the quarter.Among the established products, Forteo sales declined 12% to $177.1 million. Humulin sales dropped 17% to $238.2 million. Alimta sales declined 74% to $119.4 million. Humalog sales declined 29% to $447.0 million due to lower realized prices and currency headwinds.Adjusted gross margin remained flat year over year at 79%. Operating income rose 6% year over year to $2.01 billion, benefitting from increased sales volume experienced during the quarter.2022 Guidance UpdatedLilly lowered its guidance for revenues and earnings. The company now expects revenues to be between $28.5-$29.0 billion, down from previous guidance range of $28.8-$29.3 billion to account for currency headwinds.Earnings per share are expected to be between $7.70 and $7.85, down from $7.90 and $8.05 previously. Lilly lowered its earnings per share guidance due to currency headwinds and a 6 cents per share negative impact of acquired IPR&amp;D and development milestone charges.Acquired IPR&amp;D and development milestone charges, are expected to be approximately $670 million in 2022, up from the previously reiterated $610 million.Following the earnings announcement, shares of Lilly were down 4.3% in pre-market trading in response to the guidance cut. Shares of Lilly have risen 31.1% this year so far compared with the industry’s increase of 2.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe gross margin is expected to be approximately 78% (same as before) while the adjusted operating margin is expected to be around 29% (same as before).Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.4-$6.6 billion (same as before). Research and development expense is expected to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion (same as before).Our TakeThough Lilly reported encouraging third-quarter results beating earnings and sales estimates despite currency headwinds, the company trimmed its full year earnings guidance for a third time this year.New drug Mounjaro generated additional sales for the company during the quarter. The drug is expected to become a significant contributor to Lilly’s revenues in subsequent quarters. Management is gearing up for new drug launches in the form of donanemab (for Alzheimer’s disease) and pirtobrutinib (for mantle cell lymphoma). The launch of these drugs is in line with Lilly’s plan to launch five new medicines before 2023-end. These drugs, if approved, are expected to have a multibillion-dollar sales potential.Eli Lilly and Company Price Eli Lilly and Company PriceEli Lilly and Company price | Eli Lilly and Company Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderLilly currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some other top-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector include Angion Biomedica ANGN, Gilead Sciences GILD and Merck MRK.

211,1c1dd50f-9424-339e-8259-7944adecc928,MRK,2022-11-02,4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy as Dow Seals Record October Gains,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-blue-chip-stocks-buy-122712409.html,1667305632,STORY,"['MRK', '^GSPC', 'HD', 'CAT']","[U.S. stocks slipped on Oct 31 as investors keep an eye on how much the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this week to tame stubbornly high inflation. Lest we forget, the Fed’s hawkish stance did batter the stock market for the most part of the year. However, despite Monday’s losses, the major bourses were able to lock in gains for the month of October.While the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were able to notch single-digit gains in October, it’s the Dow that soared 14% and registered its best month since 1976. The blue-chip index, in fact, made a commendable comeback in October and snapped a two-month losing streak. The 30-stock index ended in the green for the month as investors continued to place their bets on traditional companies like banks.Most importantly, the blue-chip index primarily comprises energy and industrial stocks, which no doubt have been among the best-performing sectors since the beginning of this year. Energy shares have been gaining due to the rise in oil prices. In fact, the international benchmark for oil prices — Brent crude — jumped 7.8% last month.Oil prices, by the way, scaled north mostly due to the Russia-Ukraine war, and the resurgence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in China since all these led to a demand-supply disparity. Similarly, industrial shares gained, thanks to a thriving manufacturing sector, which is already boosting economic growth throughout the United States.Talking about the economy, third-quarter GDP increased faster than expected and eased recession fears. In reality, it was the first positive quarter this year that witnessed the blue-chip stocks climbing northward.Another reason that led to the Dow notching remarkable gains last month was its lack of exposure to mega-cap tech stocks. These stocks, unfortunately, took a beating in recent times due to discouraging earnings results.For instance, blue-chip tech stocks like Verizon and Microsoft saw their shares tank over the course of October. While Verizon reported a decline in subscriber gains in the third quarter, Microsoft witnessed a slowdown in its cloud-computing business.Story continuesNonetheless, with the broader blue-chip index witnessing a sharp run-up in October, it’s prudent to invest in blue-chip stocks that not only gained last month but also are poised to add more gains, banking on solid cash flows and a strong balance sheet. We have, thus, selected four such blue-chip stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Caterpillar CAT is the largest global construction and mining equipment manufacturer. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.9% over the past 60 days. CAT’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 18%.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM is one of the biggest global banks. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 3.2% over the past 60 days. JPM’s expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 5%.Home Depot HD is the world’s largest home improvement specialty retailer. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.5% over the past 60 days. HD’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.2%.Merck &amp; Co. MRK operates as a healthcare company worldwide. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next-year earnings has moved up 1.8% over the past 60 days. MRK’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 22.1%.Shares of Caterpillar, JPMorgan, Home Depot and Merck, incidentally, have gained 31.9%, 20.5%, 7.3% and 17.5%, individually, in October.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results and introduced fiscal 2023 guidance.""We had a great finish to this fiscal year, with our Q4 organic sales and earnings both growing double digits year over year and sequentially. Rockwell delivered very strong operating performance amidst continued supply chain volatility, significant inflation, and currency headwinds. Our strong orders and sales performance in fiscal 2022 reflect the compelling value we provide to our customers across many industries and regions,"" said Blake Moret, Chairman and CEO.Fiscal Q4 2022 Financial ResultsFiscal 2022 fourth quarter sales were $2,126 million, up 17.6% compared to $1,808 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic sales increased 20.5%, currency translation decreased sales by 4.8%, and acquisitions increased sales by 1.9%.Fiscal 2022 fourth quarter net income attributable to Rockwell Automation was $339 million or $2.91 per share, compared to $78.5 million or $0.67 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The increases in net income attributable to Rockwell Automation and EPS were primarily due to fair value adjustments recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 in connection with our investment in PTC (the ""fourth quarter PTC adjustment""). Fiscal 2022 fourth quarter Adjusted EPS was $3.04, up 30.5% compared to $2.33 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by a higher tax rate and unfavorable currency impact.Story continuesPre-tax margin was 19.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 0.2% in the same period last year. The increase in pre-tax margin was primarily due to the fourth quarter PTC adjustment.Total segment operating earnings were $495 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, up 53.1% compared to $323 million in the same period of fiscal 2021. Total segment operating margin was 23.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 17.9% a year ago. The increase in segment operating margin was primarily due to higher sales and positive price/cost, partially offset by unfavorable currency impact.Cash flow provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $399 million, compared to $204 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Free cash flow was $359 million compared to $160 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Increases in cash flow provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to higher pre-tax income.Fiscal 2022 Full Year Financial ResultsSales were $7,760 million in fiscal 2022, up 10.9% from $6,997 million in fiscal 2021. Organic sales increased 11.3%, currency translation decreased sales by 2.7%, and acquisitions increased sales by 2.3%.Fiscal 2022 net income attributable to Rockwell Automation was $932 million or $7.97 per share, compared to $1,358 million or $11.58 per share in fiscal 2021. The decreases in net income attributable to Rockwell Automation and EPS were primarily due to fair value adjustments recognized in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 in connection with our investment in PTC (the ""full year PTC adjustments""). Fiscal 2022 Adjusted EPS was $9.49, up 0.6% compared to $9.43 in fiscal 2021. The increase in Adjusted EPS was primarily due to higher sales and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher investment spend, higher tax rate, and a prior year favorable legal settlement.Pre-tax margin was 13.8% in fiscal 2022, compared to 21.8% last year. The decrease in pre-tax margin was primarily due to the full year PTC adjustments.Total segment operating earnings were $1,543 million in fiscal 2022, up 10.9% from $1,391 million in fiscal 2021. Total segment operating margin was 19.9% compared to 19.9% a year ago. The positive impact from higher sales and lower incentive compensation was offset by higher investment spend and negative price/cost.Cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2022 was $823 million, compared to $1,261 million in fiscal 2021. Free cash flow was $682 million compared to $1,141 million last year. Decreases in cash flow provided by operating activities and free cash flow were driven by higher working capital and the timing of bonus payments.OutlookThe table below provides guidance for sales growth and earnings per share for fiscal 2023.

It represents the annual contract value of all active recurring revenue contracts at any point in time. Recurring revenue is defined as a revenue stream that is contractual, typically for a period of 12 months or more, and has a high probability of renewal. The probability of renewal is based on historical renewal experience of the individual revenue streams, or management's best estimates if historical renewal experience is not available. Organic ARR growth is calculated as the dollar change in ARR, adjusted to exclude the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, divided by ARR as of the prior period. The effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating Organic ARR on a constant currency basis. When we acquire businesses, we exclude the effect of ARR in current period for which there was no comparable ARR in the prior period. Organic ARR growth is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Because ARR is based on annual contract value, it does not represent revenue recognized during a particular reporting period or revenue to be recognized in future reporting periods and is not intended to be a substitute for revenue, contract liabilities, or backlog.Conference CallA conference call to discuss our financial results will take place at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, November 2, 2022.

Therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. Sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year, excluding divestitures. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2022, compared to sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2021:Three Months Ended September 30,20222021Reported SalesLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganicSalesReported SalesNorth America$1,309.8$32.0$(5.0)$1,282.8$1,068.1EMEA381.42.2(58.9)438.1352.9Asia Pacific296.1—(20.2)316.3268.6Latin America139.00.4(3.2)141.8118.2Total$2,126.3$34.6$(87.3)$2,179.0$1,807.8Twelve Months Ended September 30,20222021Reported SalesLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganicSalesReported SalesNorth America$4,722.0$152.0$(6.5)$4,576.5$4,132.8EMEA1,437.66.8(140.5)]"

The company has fallen short of Wall Street earnings estimates for five quarters in a row. Its shares have fallen 29% this year, compared with a 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index.At the top of investors' wish list is clarity for production and delivery targets of the company's 737 MAX and 787 jets, the key to Boeing's free cash flow and profits.Shortages of parts and labor have hobbled production, and changes in forecasts have eroded investor confidence.Boeing last month predicted it would deliver 375 MAX planes this year, lower than a July target of ""low 400s."" At the start of the year, it had planned to deliver about 500 of the single-aisle aircraft.Boeing has said it expects the aircraft's monthly delivery trend to remain in the low 30s going into next year, before ramping up to 40 a month towards the end of 2023. That is below the estimates of some analysts. Similarly, production for 787 planes remains low. Boeing expects to gradually ramp up the rate to five airplanes per month.REGULATORY HURDLESBoeing is also expected to provide an update on the certification of MAX 7 and MAX 10 planes. The company faces a late December deadline for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to certify the planes under existing rules.Story continuesAfter that date, all planes must have modern cockpit alerting systems to be certified by the FAA. Last month, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun sounded confident of securing an extension of the deadline.Boeing's production and regulatory delays have made it harder for its customers to ramp up capacity to capitalize on booming travel demand. Southwest Airlines Co, Boeing's biggest 737 customer, last week said a portion of its MAX deliveries is expected to be delayed. The Dallas-based carrier expects no 737 Max 7 deliveries this year and has converted 17 orders for next year to the 737 Max 8.A pick-up in jet deliveries should boost Boeing's free cash flow, helping it pay off its debt.DEFENSE CHARGESInvestors are also looking to find out if the planemaker has got a handle on its defense business after reporting a $2.8 billion hit on fixed-price contracts last week.Analysts at Agency Partners estimate the company's various fixed price defense contracts have already resulted in $8.8 billion of charges.The heavy writedowns have sparked concerns that these contracts could result in more charges. Some analysts say the company's poor track record in forecasting defense charges have raised questions over the outlook it provides.""Every quarter one hopes that the program specific bad news has come to an end, but then we get another installment – maybe this is it? Probably not,"" said Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Agency Partners.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; Editing by Peter Henderson and Chris Reese)]"

223,df539a50-c0c8-3b89-82cd-ad6bc37fb2fc,ILMN,2022-11-02,Clene Inc. (CLNN) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clene-inc-clnn-expected-beat-140102646.html,1667311262,STORY,['ILMN'],"[Clene Inc. (CLNN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -666.7%.Revenues are expected to be $0.05 million, down 54.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.33% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Clene Inc.For Clene Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +13.04%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Clene Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Clene Inc. Would post a loss of $0.21 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.22, delivering a surprise of -4.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Clene Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, Illumina (ILMN), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.29 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -80%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.1 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Illumina has been revised 2.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.59%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Illumina will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Southern Southern Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Comptroller, Ann Daiss, sold US$506k worth of shares at a price of US$67.47 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$65.53. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Southern didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of SouthernMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Southern insiders own about US$165m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Southern Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Southern shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Southern insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Southern. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Southern (1 doesn't sit too well with us) you should be aware of.But note: Southern may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The coalition, including Georgia Power's parent Southern Company, will respond to the recently announced funding opportunity from the U.S. Department of Energy, which includes $8 billion for regional hydrogen hubs and is part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.Georgia Power logo. (PRNewsFoto/Georgia Power)A hydrogen hub in the Southeastern U.S. is expected to bring robust economic development benefits to the region, and hydrogen is attractive as an energy resource because it has immediate potential to accelerate decarbonization in the Southeast and across all sectors of the U.S. economy – including transportation, which generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. Read more about today's announcement here.""The Southeast continues to be one of the most innovative and forward-looking parts of the country when it comes to advancing new energy technologies that help decarbonize the grid, while also growing the economy and bringing jobs, and today's announcement reinforces our region's leadership in this area,"" said Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""As we continue to make smart investments that help us better deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers, we see incredible potential in the future use of hydrogen as part of our diverse energy mix.""Also earlier this summer, Mitsubishi Power and Georgia Power, alongside the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), successfully tested fuel blending of hydrogen and natural gas at both partial and full load on an M501G natural gas turbine at Georgia Power's Plant McDonough-Atkinson in Smyrna, Georgia. The demonstration project was the first to validate 20% hydrogen fuel blending on an advanced class gas turbine in North America, and the largest test of this kind to date, with the 20% blend providing an approximately 7% reduction in carbon emissions compared to natural gas.Story continuesThe landmark testing at Plant McDonough-Atkinson was part of a continued commitment to new research and development to build the energy grid of the future and to reduce carbon emissions across its generation fleet, with Georgia Power having already reduced its carbon emissions by more than 60% since 2007.To learn more about how Georgia Power is building the future of energy, visit www.georgiapower.com/future.About Georgia PowerGeorgia Power is the largest electric subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO), America's premier energy company.

The test is the world's largest chloride salt system developed by the nuclear sector. The project culminates years of separate effects testing and is expected to demonstrate how the MCFR technology will perform in delivering a commercial-scale, cost-effective, carbon-free molten salt reactor energy source by 2035.""Southern Company's research and development program is committed to advancing next-generation nuclear as part of a diverse technology portfolio supporting our goal of a net-zero future for customers,"" said Dr. Mark S. Berry, Southern Company Services senior vice president of R&amp;D. ""We are honored to engage with TerraPower, the Department of Energy and the other team members to further this goal through the Integrated Effects Test. Collaborations of this kind are critical to making transformational change in our energy system a reality.""Located at TerraPower's laboratory in Everett, Washington, the Integrated Effects Test is a nonnuclear, externally heated, up to 1-megawatt multiloop system to support future deployment of a fast-spectrum salt test reactor. The project continues work initiated in 2015 by Southern Company Services and TerraPower under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Reactor Concepts (ARC-15) award, a multiyear effort to promote the design, construction and operation of Generation-IV nuclear reactors. The project team also includes CORE POWER, EPRI, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Vanderbilt University. The program represents a $76 million total project investment with a 60%-40% public-private cost share.""The completion and installation of the Integrated Effects Test is an important step to advancing TerraPower's Molten Chloride Fast Reactor technology,"" said Jeff Latkowski, TerraPower's senior vice president of innovation programs. ""The MCFR will play a pivotal role in decarbonizing heavy industries, and we are proud to work with Southern Company, CORE POWER and other partners to develop the systems necessary to bring new reactors to market.""Story continuesThe next-generation of nuclear reactors promise the same stable value to customers that is derived from the current operating nuclear fleet, can complement intermittent renewable resources on the grid, and hold the potential to provide zero-carbon, high-grade process heat and thermal storage for energy-intensive industrial markets and ocean transportation sectors that currently rely on fossil fuels. Nuclear energy will be central to a sustainable, clean-energy future - providing affordable, reliable, resilient and dispatchable carbon-free power that is available 24 hours a day, making the success of this project integral to achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.The Integrated Effects Test signals important progress in the technology demonstration road map for TerraPower's MCFR. Data from operation of the test will help validate thermal hydraulic and safety analyses needed for the MCFR. The system will also support development and operation of the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment at Idaho National Laboratory, a less than 200-kilowatt reactor meant to provide experimental and operational data. Both the Integrated Effects Test and the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment will inform the design, licensing and operation of an approximately 180-megawatt MCFR demonstration planned for the early 2030s time frame.A Sept. 9 ribbon-cutting ceremony was attended by representatives from Southern Company, TerraPower, Idaho National Laboratory, the project and construction team, and technology partners. Construction of the Integrated Effects Test was completed by McAbee Construction Inc., and all electrical support was provided by Gulf Electric Company.In a recorded message during the event, Dr. Kathryn Huff, assistant secretary for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy said, ""The IET facility is a huge step forward in commercializing molten salt reactor technology that will help the U.S. transition to a new, clean-energy economy and help position the U.S. as a leader in the development of advanced reactor technologies.""TerraPower's MCFR is one of the most advanced Generation-IV nuclear technologies under development and is separate from TerraPower's Natrium™ reactor and integrated energy storage technology. The MCFR is a liquid salt-fueled, salt-cooled fast reactor that will enable operation at low pressures and high temperatures. It offers superior performance, inherent benefits in safety and life-cycle sustainability, reduced capital investment and O&amp;M costs, and has the ability to operate using a number of fuel sources - including depleted and natural uranium or even spent fuel from existing reactors.About Southern CompanySouthern Company (NYSE:SO) is a leading energy company serving 9 million customers through its subsidiaries.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this real estate investment trust is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Mid-America Apartment Communities is 5.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 18.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12.2%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Mid-America Apartment Communities is 39.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 14.9%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.6%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Mid-America Apartment Communities have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.2% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Mid-America Apartment Communities a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Mid-America Apartment Communities is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Demand has been driven by a growing need for high-speed connectivity amid the pandemic-induced surge in hybrid work environments, video-streaming and web-based learning trends.Accelerated 5G deployment globally has been a tailwind for Skyworks. Emerging use cases of 5G in end-markets like automotive and industrial IoT, and technologies like virtual reality, gaming and telemedicine are expected to have driven demand for Skyworks’ 5G solutions.Moreover, momentum for Skyworks’ bulk acoustic wave (""BAW"") filters, particularly in mobile and broad markets, is likely to have driven the top-line performance. The company has been witnessing significant design wins for BAW-enabled devices.However, supply chain disruptions, the COVID lockdown in China and the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on European sales are anticipated to have limited Skyworks' top-line growth and margin expansion in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

This compares to earnings of $1.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.53%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electronics maker would post earnings of $1.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.86, delivering a surprise of 6.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.TE Connectivity , which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Components industry, posted revenues of $4.36 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.40%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.82 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.TE Connectivity shares have lost about 23.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for TE Connectivity?While TE Connectivity has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for TE Connectivity: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

These non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our company. We believe these measures provide meaningful information to us and investors because they enhance the understanding of our operating performance, ability to generate cash, and the trends of our business. Additionally, we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operations. The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP financial measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.The following provides additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures:Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) – represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.Net Sales Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week – represents net sales excluding the impact of the additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. The impact of the additional week was estimated using average sales for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin – represent operating income and operating margin, respectively, (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, and other income or charges, if any. We utilize these adjusted measures in combination with operating income and operating margin to assess segment level operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and market conditions. Adjusted Operating Income is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.Adjusted Other Income (Expense), Net – represents net other income (expense) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other items, if any.Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate – represent income tax (expense) benefit and effective tax rate, respectively, (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any.Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations – represents income from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects.Adjusted Earnings Per Share – represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.Free Cash Flow (FCF) – is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. The difference between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) and Free Cash Flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, if any, minus net capital expenditures. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP financial measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters and cash paid (collected) pursuant to collateral requirements related to cross-currency swap contracts, are also excluded by management in evaluating Free Cash Flow. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. In the calculation of Free Cash Flow, we subtract certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP financial measure indicates. It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of Free Cash Flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of Free Cash Flow.Forward-Looking StatementsThis release contains certain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainty and changes in circumstances, which may cause actual results, performance, financial condition or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance, financial condition or achievements. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward-looking and the words ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have no intention and are under no obligation to update or alter (and expressly disclaim any such intention or obligation to do so) our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law. The forward-looking statements in this release include statements addressing our future financial condition and operating results, and the impact on our operations resulting from the coronavirus disease 2019 (""COVID-19""). Examples of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the extent, severity and duration of COVID-19 negatively affecting our business operations; business, economic, competitive and regulatory risks, such as conditions affecting demand for products in the automotive and other industries we serve; competition and pricing pressure; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices; natural disasters and political, economic and military instability in countries in which we operate, including continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine or escalating tensions in surrounding countries; developments in the credit markets; future goodwill impairment; compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations; and the possible effects on us of changes in tax laws, tax treaties and other legislation, including the effects of Swiss tax reform. In addition, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include the geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, the impact on our suppliers' and customers' supply chains, the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak in jurisdictions in which we operate, and the possible impact on the global economy and local economies in which we operate.

On that day, Nike is projected to report earnings of $0.66 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 20.48%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.58 billion, up 10.76% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.97 per share and revenue of $48.97 billion. These totals would mark changes of -20.8% and +4.84%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

On Tuesday, Pfizer announced the company’s maternal RSV vaccine has shown enough promising data to be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year. If approved, the vaccine would become the first to help prevent RSV in young infants, but it’s unclear when it would become available.RSV is a common respiratory illness that usually causes cold-like symptoms in most people, but can be serious in infants and young children. It’s the leading cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis (inflammation and congestion in the small airways of the lungs) in babies under 1.A maternal vaccine given to pregnant people would pass on antibodies to babies before delivery, similar to the flu and whooping cough vaccines. In the Pfizer trial, the vaccine was about 80% effective in preventing RSV in infants, CNN reports.“We’ve had a major unmet need in our field of pediatrics for an RSV vaccine or other immunizations as well as antiviral treatment. It’s been an elusive topic for scientists,” says Dr. Larry Kociolek, medical director of infection, prevention and control and attending physician diseases at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “But we’ve made a lot of progress over the last several years in understanding how people become immune to RSV.”The virus typically follows a seasonal pattern with cases rising in late fall and early winter, sometimes coinciding with flu season. Each year, approximately 58,000 children under 5 are hospitalized due to RSV infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And with the recent surge, many children’s hospitals are already at capacity.“Every year we see high levels of RSV cases among babies in the U.S. with some regions reporting hospital admission rates higher than normal this year,” Dr. Eric A.F. Simões, clinical professor, pediatrics-infectious diseases, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital Colorado, Aurora, says in a press release about the Pfizer vaccine. “A maternal vaccine with high efficacy that can help protect infants from birth could substantially reduce the burden of severe RSV among newborns through six months of age, and, if approved by regulatory authorities, will likely have a significant impact on disease in the U.S. and globally.”Story continuesThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: ‘I’m an additional paid family member’: The life of a 27-year-old house manager who makes $45K a yearThe former CEO of Walmart U.S. left the $300 billion retailer to lead Air New Zealand.

This compares to earnings of $1.11 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.22%.

This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality in nature.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) fall if they miss or just meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it looks good apparently) doesn't tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend. If that is the case, the company's fundamentals are in question.There is also the factor of seasonal fluctuation. If a company's Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are ambiguous while judging the company's true health.Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts study companies' financials and initiatives to forecast earnings. They, in fact, club their insights and the company's guidance to arrive at an earnings estimate. So, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company's own expectation as well as market perception. And if the company manages to surpass earnings by a wide margin, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release.How to Find Those Gems?Since it is hard to predict if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season, investors can check its earnings surprise history. A notable track record generally acts as a tailwind. It revs up chances of beating estimates in the next release, too, as investors expect the company to use the same old trick to surpass expectations or is smart enough to pull off a beat in the next release.Story continuesHere are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen:Albemarle: Albemarle Corp. is a premier specialty chemicals company with leading positions in attractive end markets globally.

If you want to jump ahead to the top five companies in this list, then take a look at 5 Biggest Gas Companies in the World.The Gas Industry: An AnalysisThe ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the global push toward clean energy have placed an even higher premium on natural gas. The fuel has multiple advantages over both renewable energy and crude oil. Natural gas is a clean burning fuel, which results in fewer emissions and it is also able to generate higher amounts of energy per kilogram.Globally, gas is being sold at a premium and prices touched record high earlier this year when they crossed $10 per MMBtu. The prices have almost halved since then, and the natural gas futures market, which bets on the prices of the commodity for the next month, are also significantly down year to date. Yet, the futures continue to trade at the higher end of their 52-week range, as the shock in prices that erupted this year continues to make its mark felt.As for the gas industry itself, it is still one of the largest in the world and according to the research firm The Business Research Company, the market was worth $840 billion last year. From then to the end of this year, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% to sit at $940 billion. Additionally, the firm goes on to add that from the end of 2022 to 2026, the market will grow at a 6.9% CAGR and be worth $1.23 trillion by the end of the forecast period.For our list for you today, we will take a look at the largest natural gas companies in the world, and among the publicly traded names, the ones likely to catch your eye are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Photo by Robin Sommer on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn order to sift out the largest natural gas companies in the world, we studied the revenue of the companies and then ranked them according to their net sales.

It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are met by TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in our list of the world's largest gas companies. Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Gas Companies in the World.  Suggested Articles:Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks To BuyWhat Are the Best Stocks To Buy Now?10 Most Undervalued Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 15 Biggest Gas Companies in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Marathon Petroleum shares have added about 77.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Marathon Petroleum?While Marathon Petroleum has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Marathon Petroleum: favorable.

266,a65f9aec-e10f-37c0-8760-8abc1ee62bc1,MPC,2022-11-02,Top 5 Stocks With Solid Earnings Beat Potential,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-stocks-solid-earnings-112011348.html,1667301611,STORY,"['MPC', 'ALB']","[It is not surprising that during an earnings season, investors look for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality in nature.Why Is Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) fall if they miss or just meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it looks good apparently) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend. If that is the case, the company’s fundamentals are in question.There is also the factor of seasonal fluctuation. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are ambiguous while judging the company’s true health.Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts study companies’ financials and initiatives to forecast earnings. They, in fact, club their insights and the company’s guidance to arrive at an earnings estimate. So, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as market perception. And if the company manages to surpass earnings by a wide margin, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release.How to Find Those Gems?Since it is hard to predict if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season, investors can check its earnings surprise history. A notable track record generally acts as a tailwind. It revs up chances of beating estimates in the next release, too, as investors expect the company to use the same old trick to surpass expectations or is smart enough to pull off a beat in the next release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Story continuesLast EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria have narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 10.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen:Albemarle ALB: Albemarle Corporation is a premier specialty chemicals company with leading positions in attractive end markets globally. It has a Zacks Rank #1.

The beer maker also reaffirmed its full year outlook as it continues to navigate the higher cost environment and overall global inflation pressures. Decent quarter for Molson Coors. I wouldn't say it was as good as what we heard from AB InBev earlier in the week, and then even what we heard from Constellation Brands a couple of weeks ago.But I do like the fact that Molson Coors is putting Coors Light, Miller Lite, and Coors Banquet in the premium beer category. To me, I enjoy all those beers, and they taste very premium in my humble view.BRAD SMITH: I didn't get as deep into this one, but did they say anything about where the consumer tastes might be changing or shifting? Because I mean, liquors, wines-- or wines and spirits, rather, that has been something that I think consumers gravitated towards during the pandemic. And then we saw kind of a little bit of a move away from that and towards some of the new canned cocktails as well here.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, ready to drink, I mean, that's been one of the biggest drivers of the whole industry. We understand that new Jack and Coke in a can comes out from Coca-Cola in the first part of next year, that could be pretty big. That's innovation in its finest form.BRAD SMITH: It's not already out?BRIAN SOZZI: Not out. It's launching--[BUZZER]--a little bit in Mexico, but soon in the US early next year.BRAD SMITH: I saw a fake one then, OK.]"

Meanwhile, earnings missed the consensus mark and declined year over year. The top line continued to benefit from a favorable sales mix and improved pricing trends across regions. However, consumer inflationary pressures, a strike at its Quebec brewery and the cycling of a solid shipment in the prior-year quarter hurt results.The company’s adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share declined 24.6% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36.Net sales rose 4% to $2,935.2 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,858 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 7.9% due to positive pricing, and a favorable sales mix stemming from portfolio premiumization, offset by a decline in financial volumes.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 8.8% year to date against the industry’s decline of 10.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Quarterly DetailsNet sales per hectoliter increased 9.2% on a brand-volume basis, driven by strong net pricing, and a favorable sales mix from portfolio premiumization.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes fell 2% to 22.1 million due to sluggishness in the America segment, owing to lower Canada shipments and continued impacts of the Québec labor strike. This was partly offset by higher EMEA &amp; APAC financial volumes on increased brand volumes in Western Europe.Financial volumes declined 0.2% to 22.8 million hectoliters due to a 1.5% decline in the Americas on soft industry performance and continued impacts of the Québec labor strike, and a 3.1% decrease in EMEA &amp; APAC due to the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern European countries. This was partially negated by growth in Western Europe.Underlying (non-GAAP) earnings before income taxes (EBT) declined 5% year over year to $364.6 million.

Financial volumes declined 1% year over year on reduced Canada shipments due to the Québec labor strike, offset by a 1.4% increase in U.S. domestic shipments.Brand volume for the segment dropped 1.5% on a 0.9% fall in the United States, owing to softer industry performance and an 8.6% decline in Canada due to the Québec labor strike, offset by 3.5% growth in Latin America on gains in Mexico.Net sales per hectoliter, on a brand volume basis, rose 7.5% on a constant-currency basis due to a favorable sales mix and higher net pricing. Underlying EBT improved 7.5% and 10.5% on a reported and constant-currency basis, respectively, to $378.1 million. The increase can be attributed to higher pricing, lower depreciation expenses, favorable sales mix and lower MG&amp;A expenses, offset by cost inflation on materials, transportation and energy costs, and lower financial volume.EMEA &amp; APAC: The segment’s net sales (on a reported basis) declined 6.4% to $562.6 million but improved 9.6% on a constant-currency basis. Higher constant-currency sales resulted from financial volume growth, favorable pricing and a positive sales mix. Net sales per hectoliter (on a brand volume basis) for the segment advanced 14.3% on a constant-currency basis, resulting from a favorable sales mix, as well as higher pricing.The segment’s financial volumes rose 2% due to brand and factored volume growth in Western Europe, partly negated by consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern Europe. Brand volume declined 3.1% due to volume declines resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern Europe, somewhat offset by brand volume growth across Western Europe.The segment’s underlying EBT declined 8.4% on a reported basis to $41.5 million and 38.9% constant-currency basis due to cost inflation, particularly in materials, transportation and energy costs, as well as higher MG&amp;A spending. However, higher financial volumes, favorable pricing and sales mix were offsetting.Other Financial UpdatesMolson Coors ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $525.2 million. At the end of third-quarter 2022, the company had a total debt of $6,587.7 million, resulting in net debt of $6,062.5 million.In the nine months ending Sep 30, 2022, the company provided $1,117.5 million in cash by operating activities, resulting in an underlying free cash flow of $597.4 million.In the first nine months of 2022, the company declared and paid out cash dividends of $1.14 per share, with the CAD equivalent totaling C$1.45 per share.

On Feb 17, 2022, the company approved a share-repurchase program to buy back up to an aggregate of $200 million worth of its Class B common stock till Mar 31, 2026.OutlookDespite the continued uncertainties related to the pandemic, as well as rising cost inflation, management has retained the 2022 view. Net sales are projected to grow year over year in the mid-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Underlying EBT is likely to grow year over year in the high-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Management estimates achieving a net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio below 3.0X by 2022.Underlying depreciation and amortization are projected to be $700 million, plus or minus 5%, compared with the $750 million mentioned earlier. The company expects an underlying effective tax rate of 21-22% compared with the 22-24% stated earlier. Consolidated net interest expenses are anticipated to be $265 million, plus or minus 5%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The AES Corp. AES, Ameren Corp. AEE, Pinnacle West Capital Corp. PNW and Primo Water Corp. PRMW.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Utilities Set to Surpass Estimates This Earnings SeasonPer the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector's third-quarter 2022 earnings are expected to decline 9.3% while revenues are estimated to improve 3%. The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates and rising operating costs, while new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.With the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified four utilities, namely The AES Corp. and Ameren Corp. ,  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. and Primo Water Corp., which are poised to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A few large utilities like NextEra Energy, American Electric Power Company and FirstEnergy Corp., among others, have already reported a positive surprise in their respective earnings releases.Factors That Likely Impacted Q3 ResultsDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.Story continuesCapital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The ongoing increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Weather does play a significant role in driving demand for utility services. Per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have spurred demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structure through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities have been educating customers relating to the proper usage of electricity to reduce utility bills and things to do during emergency situations to reduce damage.Expected Q3 OutperformersAmeren Corp. generates and distributes electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale end markets in Missouri and Illinois. During the 2022-2026 period, the company expects to spend up to $17.3 billion on overall system reliability, environmental compliance and electric and natural gas utility infrastructure improvements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.72, indicating an increase of 4.24% from the year-ago reported figure.

278,804e64fc-a5ce-31df-ac24-4ea6b8dfe87c,AES,2022-11-02,4 Utilities Set to Surpass Estimates This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-utilities-set-surpass-estimates-120412722.html,1667304252,STORY,"['AEE', 'AES', 'PNW', 'AESC']","[Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector’s third-quarter 2022 earnings are expected to decline 9.3% while revenues are estimated to improve 3%. The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates and rising operating costs, while new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.With the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified four utilities, namely The AES Corporation AES and  Ameren Corporation AEE,  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. PNW and Primo Water Corporation PRMW,which are poised to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A few large utilities like NextEra Energy, American Electric Power Company and FirstEnergy Corp., among others, have already reported a positive surprise in their respective earnings releases.Factors That Likely Impacted Q3 ResultsDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.Capital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The ongoing increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Weather does play a significant role in driving demand for utility services. Per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have spurred demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structure through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities have been educating customers relating to the proper usage of electricity to reduce utility bills and things to do during emergency situations to reduce damage.Story continuesExpected Q3 OutperformersAmeren Corporation generates and distributes electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale end markets in Missouri and Illinois. During the 2022-2026 period, the company expects to spend up to $17.3 billion on overall system reliability, environmental compliance and electric and natural gas utility infrastructure improvements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.72, indicating an increase of 4.24% from the year-ago reported figure.

The inaugural class starts next week in Houston as the airline plans to train more than 1,000 people at about a dozen locations by 2026, with the goal of at least half being women or people of color.United Launches Calibrate: Apprenticeship Program to Grow and Diversify Aircraft Technician PipelineCalibrate is a 36-month program in which participants ""earn and learn"" getting paid while completing the full-time certification and training process. Since participants get paid while they train, they forgo the expense of going to a technical school – which can cost up to $50,000.United will start accepting external applications in early 2023. Interested applicants can sign up to receive more information about Calibrate at https://careers.united.com/us/en/calibrate.""Calibrate is a great opportunity for people who are interested in pursuing a rewarding career as an aircraft technician but don't have the resources or support they need to attend traditional technical schools or colleges,"" said Rodney Luetzen, United's Vice President of Line Maintenance. ""This program will provide life-changing opportunities, help to diversify our workforce and give us access to an even bigger pool of talented, qualified, motivated people.""The apprenticeship program, a joint effort between United, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) and the Federal Aviation Administration, accelerates the path toward becoming a United AMT while also growing the airline's ranks of Ground Service Equipment mechanics and Facility Technicians.Story continuesUnited expects the second Calibrate apprentice cohort to start in early 2023, also in Houston, and will then expand to more than a dozen locations including San Francisco and Orlando.The program will focus on helping apprentices gain the skills and knowledge required to test for and obtain their A&amp;P Certificate, including hands-on and classroom training. Additionally, participants will be mentored by United's world-class technicians, building relationships and acquiring union seniority as they progress through the program.""The Airline Division has done an excellent job of promoting the Aviation Maintenance Technician craft,"" said Sean O'Brien, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. ""This program creates the diversity that the Teamsters are known for and will provide great jobs for not only our current Teamster members, but also the next generation.""United has about 9,000 highly trained and certified aircraft maintenance technicians globally with combined wages and benefits totaling more than $140,000 at the top of their pay scale.

Several United leaders started out as aircraft mechanics, including the airline's current Vice President of Line Maintenance.Currently, United has Base Maintenance AMTs, Line Maintenance AMTs, and shop-based AMTs, inspectors and other licensed professionals at 50 locations worldwide.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The AES Corp. AES, Ameren Corp. AEE, Pinnacle West Capital Corp. PNW and Primo Water Corp. PRMW.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Utilities Set to Surpass Estimates This Earnings SeasonPer the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector's third-quarter 2022 earnings are expected to decline 9.3% while revenues are estimated to improve 3%. The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates and rising operating costs, while new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.With the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified four utilities, namely The AES Corp. and Ameren Corp. ,  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. and Primo Water Corp., which are poised to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A few large utilities like NextEra Energy, American Electric Power Company and FirstEnergy Corp., among others, have already reported a positive surprise in their respective earnings releases.Factors That Likely Impacted Q3 ResultsDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.Story continuesCapital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The ongoing increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Weather does play a significant role in driving demand for utility services. Per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have spurred demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structure through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities have been educating customers relating to the proper usage of electricity to reduce utility bills and things to do during emergency situations to reduce damage.Expected Q3 OutperformersAmeren Corp. generates and distributes electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale end markets in Missouri and Illinois.

If you had invested in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $4,090.99, or a gain of 309.10%, as of November 1, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 174.19% and the price of gold went up -8.53% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for ISRG too.Intuitive Surgical reported robust third-quarter results, beating estimates on both counts. The company’s da Vinci procedure volume demonstrated strong recovery in the first nine months of 2022, a trend likely to continue in upcoming quarter. The company’s revenue growth in the quarter under review reflected rise in revenues from procedures, system placements and services across all markets. Per management, strong U.S. dollar, lingering supply chain issues and inflation hurt operating margin. Despite this challenging environment, Intuitive Surgical witnessed healthy customer demand for its products in the quarter under review. A stable liquidity position is an added plus. It outperformed its industry so far this year. Yet, stiff competition in the global MedTech space and rising costs remain concerns for Intuitive Surgical.Shares have gained 27.47% over the past four weeks and there have been 7 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in CSX's (NASDAQ:CSX) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on CSX is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$5.8b ÷ (US$42b - US$2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, CSX has an ROCE of 15%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 15%. View our latest analysis for CSX roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for CSX compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for CSX.How Are Returns Trending?CSX is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 31% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Bottom LineTo sum it up, CSX is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And with a respectable 80% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CSX can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Like most companies, CSX does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.While CSX isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.7%.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's third-quarter bottom line is pegged at 23 cents per share. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported a loss per share of $4.91. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $3 billion, suggesting a whopping 557.6% surge from the year-ago reported figure.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. QuoteFactors to NoteRoyal Caribbean’s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong demand for leisure travel and cruising, improved booking trends and solid onboard spending. An increase in ticket revenues, and onboard and other revenues are likely to have aided the top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter passenger ticket revenues, and onboard and other revenues is currently pegged at $2,042 million and $933 million, respectively, indicating $280 million and $177 million growth from the respective prior-year quarter’s reported figures. Increased penetration of pre-cruise purchases is likely to have driven RCL’s onboard revenue performance in the to-be-reported quarter.However, China, which is closed to international travelers, is likely to have hurt its performance. On the other hand, supply-chain constraints, transitory costs related to health and safety protocols and elevated expenses (including fuel and food) are likely to negatively impact the results.The company has also anticipated the hurdles that can weigh on its 2022 earnings. For the second half of 2022, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD, are likely to be higher by mid-single digits compared with 2019. The third quarter is expected to be higher.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Royal Caribbean this time around.

""You see excess inventory levels at retailers like Old Navy, like Kohl's, where the consumer is just a bit tighter.""An inflatable snowman and candy canes are part of the decorations that adorn houses in Brooklyn's Dyker Heights neighborhood, Tuesday, Dec. 22, 2020 in New York.

And even with heavy promotions, inventory levels remain uncomfortably high, as indicated in the chart below.Too much inventory!Meanwhile, consumers are balking at price increases for apparel and accessories, and labor costs to staff stores are on the rise.Against this backdrop, the VanEck Retail ETF (RTH) is up more than 3% in the past month, beating the slight drop in the Dow Jones Industrial average.However, Hutchinson said most retail companies will issue conservative guidance when they report third-quarter earnings over the next few weeks. That could lead to fresh selling pressure in the space.""We think they'll issue cautious outlooks for 4Q,"" Hutchinson added. ""Some of it is because they brought in inventory too early.

(Graphic: Business Wire)To deliver a more immersive experience, vehicles are incorporating widescreen displays throughout the cabin. Increased automation and autonomy are pushing the requirements of these displays from a typical infotainment hub to a safety center with visuals surrounding the vehicle. Furthermore, the automotive industry is accelerating the transition to electric vehicles, where power consumption is increasingly important.To meet these requirements, ADI has developed a unique approach called local dimming that drives LEDs behind the screen in the car display unit. Developed through a proprietary power process technology, the driver integrates all external switching positive channel field effect transistors (PFETs), enables high resolution and high contrast ratio for large automotive displays, provides improved diagnostics of LEDs, and reduces ghost images. The system reduces power consumption by a minimum of 50% compared to the traditional edge lit display. ADI’s power portfolio is ASIL-B to D rated, a critical consideration for many automotive manufacturers that require functional safety features to ensure reliable operation within the vehicle.Story continuesADI aims to enhance the in-cabin experience by enabling energy-efficient widescreens capable of local dimming through proprietary power management and processing solutions, as well as high resolution displays through Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link™ (GMSL) serializer and deserializer (SerDes) connectivity solutions.""To help us maintain our leadership position in the market as one of the world’s top automotive display manufacturers catering to some of the largest OEMs, ADI's local dimming automotive display drivers deliver the power efficiency consistent with the quality standard of the AUO brand,"" said Simon Hsu, Head of Automotive Business Unit at AUO.

(NYSE:V) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Visa as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Visa peKeen to find out how analysts think Visa's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Visa's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Visa's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 37%. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 46% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 12% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.6% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Visa's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Visa maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet. Take a look at our free balance sheet analysis for Visa with six simple checks on some of these key factors.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

(V) Worth Betting on Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-visa-inc-130001480.html,1667307601,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +14%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +8.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 13.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $2 per share, indicating a change of +10.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.34 points to a change of +11.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.65 indicates a change of +15.7% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Visa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.04 billion and $35.86 billion estimates indicate +9.3% and +11.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.12%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The U.S. dollar gained against major currencies.U.S. treasury yields slid further after data showed growth in U.S. consumer spending slowed in the third quarter, a sign inflation is peaking and the Federal Reserve can soon ease its aggressive hiking of interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.14% by 1:39 p.m. ET(1739 GMT), following a slew of upbeat earnings reports and data that showed U.S. economic growth rebounded in the third quarter. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.12% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.08%, pressured by a drop in Meta shares.""The U.S. is not currently in recession, given the strength of the consumer sector.

MSCI's index of EM stocks was about 1% higher.The Bank of Canada delivered a smaller-than-expected rate hike late on Wednesday, bolstering investors' hopes that central banks would slow their aggressive pace of rate hikes.Data on Thursday also showed the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases hurt consumer spending.The Fed is expected to deliver a 75-bps hike in November, but speculation that it may be less aggressive afterwards has led the dollar to decline 1.4% so far this week.The yen gave back early gains seen ahead of Friday's Bank of Japan meeting.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ), News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWS), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) are some of the leading companies that pay dividends on either an annual or semi-annual basis.Of the thousands of companies on the U.S. stock market that make dividend payments to shareholders, the vast majority do so either monthly or quarterly. In fact, there are so few companies that make dividend payments on an annual basis that we had to include a few companies that make semi-annual payments (which are slightly less rare, though still uncommon) to fill out our list.More frequent dividend payout schedules can be advantageous for investors, allowing them to reinvest their payments sooner or giving them a steady flow of income. Some of the best dividend stocks on the market make less frequent payments though and shouldn’t be overlooked. If nothing else, stocks that make annual dividend payments are easier to trade in and out of if you’re just looking to stockpile dividend payments.There are a number of reasons why a company may choose to make dividend payments less frequently. For some companies, the seasonality of their business model may dictate that the majority of their earnings are accrued during a small stretch of the year, which may incentivize them to make dividend payments during only those periods. In other cases, broader cash flow concerns may prompt a company to make less frequent payments so they can better manage short downturns in their income streams.That’s not to say any of the following stocks aren’t necessarily safe dividend stocks. That all comes down to the company’s overall payout ratio and future cash flow projections, which we’ll dig into when analyzing each of them in turn. That said, several of them are smaller companies with less robust dividend payment histories and limited institutional support, so that’s worth considering before making any investment decision.Story continuesThe following list of top annual dividend stocks includes all of the companies’ relevant dividend history, including payout rates, payout ratios, the latest changes to their dividend policies, and the schedule for their upcoming payments.12 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy NowImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from PixabayOur MethodologyThe following annual dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.

IF Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:IROQ)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 1 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.375 News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWS), Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) rank as some of the best annual dividend stocks to buy now. A compelling semi-annual dividend payer is IF Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:IROQ), which has grown its dividend at a CAGR of 15.8% over the last five years, having more than doubled its annual payouts since 2017.A bank holding company that manages the business activities of personal and commercial bank Iroquois Federal, IF Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:IROQ) grew net income to $1.84 per diluted share in the company’s FY22 ended June 30, up from $1.74 a year earlier. Return on average equity jumped 73 basis points during the company’s fiscal Q4 to 7.07%. While it may not be able to sustain its current dividend growth rate longer-term, with a yield already above 2%, IROQ shares are an interesting under-the-radar dividend pick.Just a lone hedge fund was long IF Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:IROQ) on June 30, that being Jeffrey Gendell’s Tontine Asset Management, which owned 251,679 shares worth $4.78 million. In over ten years of tracking the stock’s hedge fund ownership, it’s never had less than one or more than two shareholders during any given quarter.11. Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (NYSE:CPAC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 1 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.5276 Peruvian cement company Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (NYSE:CPAC) has made an annual or special dividend payments over each of the last ten years. Its next payment is scheduled for December 12 with an ex-dividend date of November 11. The company’s dividend payout ratio is hovering above 90%, so the dividend is unlikely to go much higher from here, especially with analysts predicting the company’s EPS will fall by 13% to $0.34 next year. With a yield of nearly 10% though, its dividend doesn’t need continued growth to be a compelling micro-cap dividend play.Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (NYSE:CPAC) grew operating income by 7.6% in the September quarter, reaching just under $90 million. Revenue grew by just over 9% to $554 million, slightly outpacing the company’s cost of revenue, which rose by 8%.There was also just a lone hedge fund long Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (NYSE:CPAC) on June 30, Jim Simons’ quant fund Renaissance Technologies, which owned a paltry 12,464 shares, which it bought during the second quarter. Prior to that, there hadn’t been a fund long CPAC since the first quarter of 2018, which also happened to be Renaissance Technologies with a similarly small stake.10. G. Willi-Food International Limited (NASDAQ:WILC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 2 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.87 After making a single dividend payment last year, G. Willi-Food International Limited (NASDAQ:WILC) officially began making semi-annual payments this year, which totaled $0.87, giving WILC shares a yield of 6.43%. G. Willi-Food International Limited (NASDAQ:WILC) has become much more profitable in recent years, which has allowed the company to begin rewarding shareholders with payouts.The Israel-based food products distributor rarely topped $0.50 in EPS between 2009 and 2018 and never earned more than 0.79 per share. It’s topped $1.00 in EPS over each of the last three years however, including $1.21 in 2020. It’s also had its two best years in terms of EBITDA over each of the last two years, pulling in $20 million and $18 million respectively.The same two funds have been long G. Willi-Food International Limited (NASDAQ:WILC) dating back seven quarters: Jim Simon’s Renaissance Technologies and Brian Gaines’ Springhouse Capital Management. The latter has held a stake in the company since late 2015, while RenTech’s ownership stretches back to at least 2010.9. Sasol Limited (NYSE:SSL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 5 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.8578 After halting its semi-annual dividend payments in 2019, South African energy and chemicals company Sasol Limited (NYSE:SSL) relaunched an annual dividend this year, which paid out $0.8578 on September 23, giving shares a yield of close to 5%. The latest payout was well beneath the company’s historical annual payments, and could rise in the years to come.Sasol Limited (NYSE:SSL)’s net income has quadrupled in the last year to $2.7 billion, which the company has primarily used to pay down its mountain of debt, which was partly incurred due to massive cost overruns in the building of its Lake Charles Chemicals Project in Louisiana. With that project complete and the company’s balance sheet rebounding, shareholders could be the big beneficiaries of all that net income in the years to come.Hedge fund ownership of Sasol Limited (NYSE:SSL) has been cut in half since the end of 2020, with Donald Sussman’s Paloma Partners and Israel Englander’s Millennium Management among the funds to sell off SSL during that time. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clark, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital owns the largest position in Sasol as of June 30, holding 2.25 million shares.8. Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (NASDAQ:SHEN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 6 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.08 Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (NASDAQ:SHEN) slashed its annual dividend payments from $0.34 to $0.07 last year after the telecommunications company sold off its wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) for $1.95 billion as it shifts to a fiber-first strategy. $937 million of that windfall was distributed to shareholders through a special dividend last year.Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (NASDAQ:SHEN) shareholders won’t have the benefit of such a special payout this year however, though the annual dividend was hiked ever so slightly to $0.08. The company, which operates in six U.S. states, had grown revenue by nearly 18% over the past five years, but will now operate with a narrower focus that the company believes will pay off in the long-term. Q2 revenue was $66 million, topping estimates, while the company registered a $0.06 loss per share in earnings.Hedge funds have been bailing on Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (NASDAQ:SHEN) in droves in recent years, with ownership of the stock falling by 70% since the middle of 2019. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment owns 250,979 shares of SHEN as of June 30 after selling off 57% of its holding during Q2.7. RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 9 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.6245 RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX) makes semi-annual variable dividend payments, which amounted to $0.6255 since this year, down from $0.6673 last year. The shares of the British analytics company have a solid dividend yield of 2.29% and the company has made dividend payments for 13 consecutive years.RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX) announced in earlier this month that it expects its FY22 profit to be above historical trends thanks to strong performances from its risk, scientific, technical &amp; medical business, but particularly from its exhibitions business, which had an 85% year-over-year boost in underlying revenue growth thanks to live events recovering from pandemic restrictions. RELX’s net income grew by 14.6% in the June quarter.RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX) is sitting at an all-time high in hedge fund ownership, with more than double the amount of funds being long the company on June 30 as there were five quarters earlier. Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp and Israel Englander’s Millennium Management are two prominent funds that have built stakes in RELX in recent quarters.6. National Western Life Group Inc. (NASDAQ:NWLI)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 12 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.36 The first part of the list is closed out by National Western Life Group Inc. (NASDAQ:NWLI), which has a remarkable, if somewhat auspicious track record of annual dividend payments. The company has made the same $0.36 annual payment to its shareholders every year since 2006. Unfortunately for the company’s long-term shareholders, the stock itself has seen about the same amount of share price growth during that 17-year span, being down by 4.3% since the end of 2005.National Western Life Group Inc. (NASDAQ:NWLI), which is the parent company of an insurance company which itself is the parent company of another insurance company (yes, things can and have gotten even weirder on the NWLI front), delivered consolidated net earnings of $18.93 per diluted Class A share during the first half of 2022, down from $31.68 a year earlier. The company had consolidated total assets of $13.3 billion as of June 30.There was a big jump in hedge fund ownership of National Western Life Group Inc. (NASDAQ:NWLI) during the third quarter of 2021 and ownership of the stock has remained at elevated positions in the quarters since. Paul J. Isaac’s Arbiter Partners Capital Management owns the most bullish NWLI stake among the funds tracked by our database, having 2.37% 13F exposure to the stock through owning 18,824 shares.CRH plc (NYSE:CRH), News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWS), and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) are some higher profile annual dividend stocks for investors to consider, check them out at the link below. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Invest In11 Best UK Stocks To Buy Now11 Best Dividend Stocks Under $5 Disclosure: None. 12 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

The government argued the deal should be stopped because it would lead to less competition for blockbuster books and lower advances for authors who earn $250,000 or more.Penguin Random House said the decision was ""unfortunate,"" and said it would ""immediately request an expedited appeal.""""A merger would be good for competition,"" said Thomas Rabe, chief executive of Penguin owner Bertelsmann, who said the court's decision was based on incorrect basic assumptions.Penguin writers include cookbook author Ina Garten and novelists Zadie Smith and Danielle Steele, while Simon &amp; Schuster publishes Stephen King, Jennifer Weiner and Hillary Rodham Clinton, among others.Penguin is owned by Bertelsmann, a German media group, while Paramount Global owns Simon &amp; Schuster.""The proposed merger would have reduced competition, decreased author compensation, diminished the breadth, depth, and diversity of our stories and ideas, and ultimately impoverished our democracy,"" U.S. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said in a statement.The U.S. Justice Department had filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal in November 2021.In hearings held in August, the government argued that the largest five publishers control 90% of the market, and a combined Penguin and Simon &amp; Schuster would control nearly half of the market for publishing rights to blockbuster books while its nearest competitors would be less than half its size.Story continuesPenguin Random House lawyer Daniel Petrocelli, who defeated the government in a previous merger challenge, argued during the trial that the deal would have ""enormous benefits"" for readers and authors alike because the imprints, or brands, owned by the two giants would continue to compete against each other.Best-selling author Stephen King, who testified during the three-week trial, took issue with this pledge. ""You might as well say you're going to have a husband and wife bidding against each other for the same house. It's kind of ridiculous,"" King told the court.The top five publishers are Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette, with Walt Disney Co and Amazon.com Inc also in the market. HarperCollins is owned by News Corp.Pan was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by President Joe Biden, who then nominated her to the appeals court in Washington.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications Verizon Communications Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the , Tamara Erwin, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.77 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$37.37. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Tamara Erwin.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Verizon Communications insiders own about US$28m worth of shares. That equates to 0.02% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Does This Data Suggest About Verizon Communications Insiders?The fact that there have been no Verizon Communications insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Our analysis of Verizon Communications insider transactions leaves us cautious. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Last month, Nolen wrote the NTIA seeking a delay in some 5G C-Band transmissions from smaller operators over aviation safety concerns.The FAA and NTIA declined comment on the meeting.Nolen said in his Oct. 21 letter said the agency wants the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to mandate voluntary mitigations AT&amp;T and Verizon agreed to earlier this year mandated for 19 smaller telecoms and other spectrum holders.""Aviation safety would be compromised if the U.S. government does not codify certain additional operating limits in the 5G C-Band environment,"" Nolen wrote.Industry officials say the FAA has raised the idea of temporarily prohibiting deployment of some stations in the 3.8-3.9 MHz block and maintaining some existing power limits until January 2024.The letter was sent to Davidson and FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel was copied.Rosenworcel last week confirmed that she received the letter. ""We are in discussions with our colleagues at the NTIA,"" Rosenworcel said.Concerns 5G service could interfere with airplane altimeters, which give data on a plane's height above the ground and are crucial for bad-weather landing, led to disruptions at some U.S. airports earlier this year.Verizon and AT&amp;T in June voluntarily agreed to delay some C-Band 5G usage until July 2023 as air carriers work to retrofit airplanes to ensure that they will not face interference.Airline CEOs on Jan. 17 had warned of an impending ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis that could ground almost all traffic because of the 5G deployment. A deal struck shortly before a January deadline did not prevent dozens of foreign carriers from canceling international flights to the United States.

But for educators, the appeal of tech-based learning is a little different. Technology allows students to progress at their own pace while keeping them engaged with the work. With students learning independently, educators have the freedom to interact with students one-on-one, guiding their individual learning.Verizon, Tuesday, November 1, 2022, Press release pictureGiving educators flexibility in how they teach is a huge benefit of having devices in the classroom, says Janee Moss, a Verizon Innovative Learning Schools coach at Almira School in Cleveland, Ohio. Many teachers at Almira School, including the science teacher, transitioned to tech-centric and blended learning approaches after individual devices were added to the curriculum, provided by Verizon Innovative Learning. ""[The science teacher's] classroom has transformed greatly and her comfort level with tech has grown,"" Moss says. ""The students access work [online through their devices] and hands-on in person, and [the teacher] is able to facilitate more around the room instead of being a ‘sage on a stage.'""""The students access work [online through their devices] and hands-on in person, and [the teacher] is able to facilitate more around the room instead of being a ‘sage on a stage.'""Janee Moss, Verizon Innovative Learning Schools coach at Almira School in Cleveland, OhioFor students on an individualized educational plan (IEP), personal attention may be the difference between grasping a concept - or not. Technology can help free students from hang-ups about their learning styles, too. ""Technology offers [IEP students] something that isn't in a book - something that they can tinker with that no one has ever told them they aren't good at,"" says Renee Dawson, a Verizon Innovative Learning Schools coach at Long Middle School in Atlanta, Georgia.Adding technology to the special education curriculum was a game-changer at Berendo Middle School, a Verizon Innovative Learning School in Los Angeles, CA. ""[The students] started really caring and becoming involved, and so I thought, ‘Wow, this might be a great way to reach certain students - not just students with learning disabilities - but all students,'"" says Eric Winzenried. Winzenried now regularly uses technology with his special education students as well as the media club.Story continuesVerizon Innovative Learning HQ, a free, open-access portal of next-gen learning tools, lessons and professional development resources for educators, provides simple ways to incorporate technology into any curriculum and encourage differentiated learning. This initiative is key to Verizon's commitment to helping to close the digital divide and reach 10 million students by 2030. The portal offers lessons to support tailored instruction, including the following.English | Digital Storytelling: Branching Narrative (5 lessons)In this free online lesson plan on digital storytelling, students meet Filos and discover her planet, Vilta, by reading her branching narrative story. Students design their own planet and create an interactive, narrative story by combining computer and writing skills. Students work creatively, independently and at their own pace to write a short story based on their individual interests.Math | Cross-Sections, Rotations and Nets (3 lessons)With a smartphone or tablet, students view and manipulate shapes through the magic of augmented reality. Middle and high school students can virtually rotate objects, slice them at different angles, and walk around them to understand different perspectives. Real world objects help bring the lessons to life and get students thinking about the world around them. With the McGraw Hill AR app, abstract math concepts become more concrete, and students can repeat exercises as needed to grasp the lesson objective. Standards-aligned lessons for each activity minimize prep time and guide implementation.Social Studies | You Have a Telegram! (1 lesson)Students learn how the invention of the telegraph influenced the development of modern-day communication, such as texting. Students design and build a Morse code generator that can be as simple or as complex as they desire; the lesson includes a discussion of how technology and access have transformed society and our day-to-day lives. ""You Have a Telegram!"" leverages the Verizon 5G Labs Virtual Museum and the Smithsonian Institution's Open Access collections, allowing students to engage with and leverage 3D models and XR for virtual learning.Science | Aurelia: Pelagic, Freshwater and Coral Reef (3 lessons)Students learn about biological adaptations, with the help of augmented reality, by creating bio-diverse fish as they swim through the classroom.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is Genesco (GCO). GCO is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 6.60, while its industry has an average P/E of 10.78. Over the past year, GCO's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.31 and as low as 5.49, with a median of 8.41.We should also highlight that GCO has a P/B ratio of 1.12. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.61. Over the past year, GCO's P/B has been as high as 1.81 and as low as 0.92, with a median of 1.49.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. GCO has a P/S ratio of 0.26. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.41.Finally, we should also recognize that GCO has a P/CF ratio of 4.14. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.02. GCO's P/CF has been as high as 6.36 and as low as 3.41, with a median of 5.08, all within the past year.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Retail - Apparel and Shoes value stock, take a look at Tapestry (TPR). TPR is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Tapestry is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 7.97 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.64. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 10.78 and average PEG ratio of 0.70.TPR's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.39 and as low as 6.70, with a median of 8.86. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.09, as low as 0.57, with a median of 0.77.Furthermore, Tapestry holds a P/B ratio of 3.37 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 2.61. TPR's P/B has been as high as 4.14, as low as 2.63, with a median of 3.46 over the past 12 months.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Genesco and Tapestry are likely undervalued currently.

This is expected to be November 16, 2022. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $0.56 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 52.14%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.99 billion, down 15.73% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.46 per share and revenue of $27.36 billion. These totals would mark changes of -22.07% and +1.65%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Nvidia is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesLooking at its valuation, Nvidia is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 38.97. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 9.15.Also, we should mention that NVDA has a PEG ratio of 3.18. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

Market participants are expecting another one of the same magnitude at this today’s FOMC meeting.But according to JPMorgan’s trading desk, there’s one specific scenario that could send stocks soaring.The bank’s team projects that if the central bank raises interest rates by just 50 basis points and Fed Chair Jerome Powell expresses his willingness to tolerate inflation and tight labor market conditions, the S&amp;P 500 could climb more than 10% in a day.Don’t missWant to invest your spare change but don't know where to start?

Here's how to bolster your portfolio with a shockproof alternative investmentYour cash is trash: Here are 4 simple ways to protect your money against white-hot inflation (without being a stock market genius)“It is difficult to conceive of a scenario where this outcome occurs given inflation levels and a tight labor market,” the team writes. “Should this outcome occur, the immediate reaction could produce a double-digit one-day return for equities.”Right now, the bank’s economists are still projecting a 75-basis-point increase like other market participants. But that doesn’t mean there’s no opportunity for equity market investors. Here’s a look at three stocks that JPMorgan finds particularly attractive — even in these market conditions.Apple (AAPL)No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 14 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.Earlier this year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.8 billion devices.While competitors offer cheaper devices, millions of users don’t want to live outside of the Apple ecosystem. The ecosystem acts as an economic moat, allowing the company to earn oversized profits.Story continuesIt also means that as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume.After seeing Apple’s earnings report last week, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said that the company’s ""resilience to a tough macro through the mix of Products and Services is likely to drive a re-rating.”The analyst maintains an ‘overweight’ rating on Apple and a price target of $200 — around 32% above the current levels.Nvidia (NVDA)As a leading designer of graphics cards, Nvidia shares have had a solid bull run over the past decade. But that rally came to an abrupt end in November 2021. Since reaching a peak of $346 in late November, the stock has fallen by a staggering 60%.Nvidia’s plunge is substantial even when compared to other beaten-down stocks in the semiconductor sector.Read more: ‘Stay out of 'Financial La La Land': Suze Orman says most Americans need to do this now to survive their next crisisNvidia’s business is still on the right track, making it a particularly intriguing contrarian idea.

The amount represented a 3% increase year over year.Revenue from data center increased 61% year over year to $3.81 billion.JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur recently has an ‘overweight’ rating on Nvidia and a price target of $220. That implies a potential upside of 61%.Snowflake (SNOW)Many consider big data to be the next big thing.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Fox: mixed.

The same factors described in this release that impacted these non-GAAP measures also impacted the comparable GAAP measures. Refer to page 11 for further discussion and a GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation.""On our second quarter earnings call in late July, I talked about a deceleration in demand that we expected to see in the second half of 2022 in three large verticals for freight, including weakness in the retail market and further slowing in the housing market. We’re now seeing those expectations play out, with slowing freight demand and price declines in the freight forwarding and surface transportation markets,"" said Bob Biesterfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer of C.H. Robinson. ""Throughout the changes in the freight cycle, we have maintained our focus on continuing to improve the customer and carrier experience and scaling our digital processes and operating model to foster sustainable, profitable growth.""""Today, we believe that we are entering a time of slower economic growth where freight markets will continue to cool from their peaks and will operate more reliably and at more normalized rates, with fewer disruptions. These changes in market conditions, coupled with many successful endeavors on our digital roadmap directed at scaling our model to be more efficient, are allowing us to take actions to structurally reduce our overall cost structure,"" stated Biesterfeld.Story continues""Compared to our third quarter operating expenses, the actions we’re currently taking are expected to generate $175 million of gross cost savings on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter of 2023. Inflation, other headwinds such as annual pay increases and tailwinds such as lower incentive compensation are expected to result in net cost headwinds of $25 million in 2023 that we expect will partially offset the gross savings, resulting in net annualized cost reductions of $150 million by the fourth quarter of next year.""Biesterfeld added, ""We also continue to identify opportunities to accelerate our enterprise-wide digital and product strategy. To drive greater impact and speed of execution, Arun Rajan has been promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer. Since joining C.H. Robinson in 2021, Arun has been a critical contributor to, and strategic leader of, our digital and product strategy. Arun is helping us think and act differently as we accelerate our pace of digital transformation and scale our operating model. In his new role, in addition to leading the product organization, Arun will have expanded direct responsibility for the technology and marketing organizations. Bringing these three critical functions together under a single vision and leadership structure will allow us to integrate these functions more deeply into single-threaded teams and put the needs of our customers and carriers at the center of our organizational design and ensure that we are positioned well to meet their needs while accelerating the impacts across the business units of C.H. Robinson. Arun's teams will work directly with the business unit presidents to operationalize these efforts.""Summary of Third Quarter Results Compared to the Third Quarter of 2021Total revenues decreased 4.0% to $6.0 billion, driven primarily by lower ocean and air pricing, partially offset by higher pricing in less-than-truckload (""LTL"") and truckload.Gross profits increased 5.0% to $880.7 million.

The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not material.Third quarter Robinson Fresh adjusted gross profits increased 3.8% to $27.7 million, driven by an increase in adjusted gross profit per case, which is primarily related to integrated supply chain and technology services. Managed Services adjusted gross profits increased 10.8% in the quarter, due to growth in adjusted gross profit per transaction. Other Surface Transportation adjusted gross profits decreased 10.5% to $17.7 million, primarily due to a 7.3% decrease in Europe truckload adjusted gross profits.Other Income Statement ItemsThe third quarter effective tax rate was 16.9%, up from 16.0% last year. We expect our 2022 full-year effective tax rate to be near the low end of our previous guidance of 19% to 21%.Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $16.0 million of expense, consisting primarily of $20.8 million of interest expense, which increased $7.7 million versus the third quarter of 2021 due to a higher average debt balance, partially offset by a $5.2 million favorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses.Diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were down 4.7% due primarily to share repurchases over the past twelve months.Cash Flow Generation and Capital DistributionCash generated from operations totaled $625.5 million in the third quarter, compared to $73.5 million cash used by operations in the third quarter of 2021. The $699.0 million improvement was primarily due to a $359.3 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital in the third quarter of 2022, compared to a $411.8 million sequential increase in the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in net operating working capital in the third quarter of 2022 resulted primarily from a $655.2 million sequential decrease in accounts receivable and contract assets, compared to a $295.9 million sequential decrease in total accounts payable and accrued transportation expense.In the third quarter of 2022, cash returned to shareholders increased 156% versus last year to $606.7 million, with $535.7 million in repurchases of common stock and $71.0 million in cash dividends.Capital expenditures totaled $31.3 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be at the high end of our previous guidance of $110 million to $120 million.Outlook""As inflationary pressures weigh on consumer discretionary spending and global economic growth, we continue to believe that our global suite of services, our growing digital platform, our responsive team of logistics experts, and our broad exposure to different industry verticals and geographies, supported by our resilient and flexible non-asset-based business model put us in a position to continue delivering strong financial results,"" Biesterfeld stated. ""But we also need to continue evolving our organization to bring focus to our highest strategic priorities, including keeping the needs of our customers and carriers at the center of what we do and lowering our overall cost structure by driving scale.

Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding amortization of internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. We believe adjusted gross profit is a useful measure of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider adjusted gross profit to be a primary performance measurement.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 8, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis entertainment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +54.1%.Revenues are expected to be $21.11 billion, up 13.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.04% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Disney?For Disney, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.48%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Disney will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Disney would post earnings of $0.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of +15.96%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Disney doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, Liberty Media (FWONK) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.16 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +172.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $737.35 million, up 10.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Liberty Media has been revised 7.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Liberty Media will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(OKE) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.96 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.93 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.88 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.23%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this natural gas company would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of 9.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Oneok , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, posted revenues of $5.91 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.28%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.54 billion. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Oneok shares have added about 1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Oneok?While Oneok has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Oneok: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The project is expected to cost approximately $95 million and be complete in the third quarter 2023.ONEOK announced an agreement with several Oklahoma energy companies and organizations to fund an effort to transform the state into a hub for energy technology startups. The effort aims to attract startups to the region by providing access to early-stage venture capital and other resources.THIRD QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEONEOK's higher third quarter 2022 net income and adjusted EBITDA, compared with the third quarter 2021, benefited from increased natural gas and NGL volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, higher realized commodity prices and average fee rates in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, higher average fee rates in the natural gas liquids segment and increased storage rates in the natural gas pipelines segment. Net income for the period also benefited from lower interest expense related to increased capitalized interest and lower debt balances, and higher equity in net earnings from investments.Net income for the third quarter 2022 includes the impact of ONEOK's $5 million property insurance deductible and approximately $30 million of losses related to the 45-day business interruption coverage waiting period associated with the Medford incident. Additionally, third quarter results were impacted by decreased optimization and marketing activities in the natural gas liquids segment, higher operating costs primarily related to outside services expenses and property taxes, and higher income taxes.ONEOK expects total capital expenditures, including growth and maintenance capital, of approximately $1.2 billion in 2022. Expected 2022 capital expenditures increased relative to previous estimates due primarily to acceleration of spend on the MB-5 fractionator and smaller projects that were not previously planned for 2022, such as the Viking compression electrification project in the Natural Gas Pipelines segment.Medford Facility Incident UpdateONEOK's Medford, Oklahoma, NGL fractionation facility remains out of service following a fire at the facility during the third quarter. ONEOK continues to provide midstream services while the facility is inoperable.In September 2022, ONEOK received notice that its insurers agreed to pay an unallocated first installment of insurance proceeds of $100 million. To date, ONEOK has received approximately $45 million of this amount and expects to receive the remainder before year end. ONEOK has applied the cash received to the outstanding insurance receivables.During the third quarter 2022, ONEOK incurred costs subsequent to the 45-day business interruption waiting period of $21.7 million, primarily related to third-party fractionation costs, and recorded a partial impairment charge of $6.7 million, representing the value associated with certain Medford facility property based on limited assessments to date. There is no income statement impact of these incurred business interruption costs or impairment charges, as they are fully offset by insurance receivables.BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS: Natural Gas Liquids SegmentAdjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2022, includes $21.7 million of accrued business interruption insurance recoveries and an approximately $30 million impact from the 45-day business interruption coverage waiting period related to the Medford incident.Three Months EndedNine Months EndedSeptember 30,September 30,Natural Gas Liquids Segment2022202120222021(Millions of dollars)Adjusted EBITDA$        484.8$        532.2$     1,529.8$     1,448.1Capital expenditures$        169.2$          53.8$        444.9$        225.8The decrease in third quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA, compared with the third quarter 2021, primarily reflects:A $45.0 million decrease in optimization and marketing due primarily to lower earnings on sales of purity NGLs held in inventory and narrower location and commodity price differentials. ONEOK expects an earnings benefit of approximately $17 million on the forward sales of inventory over the next two quarters; andA $16.3 million increase in operating costs due primarily to higher property taxes associated with ONEOK's completed capital-growth projects and higher outside services expenses; offset byA $10.1 million increase in exchange services due primarily to:The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the nine-month 2022 period, compared with the same period last year, primarily reflects:A $106.1 million increase in exchange services (excluding the impact of Winter Storm Uri discussed below) due primarily to:A $46.2 million increase in exchange services due to the unfavorable impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter 2021; offset byA $39.2 million decrease in optimization and marketing due primarily to nonrecurring activities in the first quarter 2021 during Winter Storm Uri, and lower earnings on sales of purity NGLs held in inventory, partially offset by wider location and commodity price differentials.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense, allowance for equity funds used during construction (equity AFUDC), and other noncash items.Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it, and similar measures, is used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate ONEOK's financial performance and to compare the company's financial performance with the performance of other companies within the industry.

360,1982b499-c5aa-30e4-b672-b41c7327c4a3,AKAM,2022-11-02,Earnings Preview: Akamai Technologies (AKAM) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-akamai-technologies-akam-140102527.html,1667311262,STORY,"['AKAM', 'DBX']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Akamai Technologies (AKAM) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 8. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cloud services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.2%.Revenues are expected to be $875.02 million, up 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.43% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Akamai Technologies?For Akamai Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.53%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Akamai Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Akamai Technologies would post earnings of $1.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.35, delivering a surprise of +3.05%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Akamai Technologies doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Services industry, Dropbox (DBX) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.37 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $585.83 million, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Dropbox has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dropbox will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

361,5ee91018-0055-32ff-881b-5a12c86abb58,HP,2022-11-02,Twilio (TWLO) to Post Q3 Earnings: Key Factors to Consider,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twilio-twlo-post-q3-earnings-165504640.html,1667321704,STORY,"['TWLO', 'PXS', 'CPA', 'HP']","[Twilio Inc. TWLO is scheduled to report its third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3.In the third quarter of 2022, Twilio anticipates revenues in the range of $965-$975 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $969.2 million, indicating an improvement of 30.9% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate projects Twilio’s revenues to be $970.2 million.The cloud-based communications platform-as-a-service provider expects a non-GAAP loss between 37 cents and 43 cents per share. The consensus mark for the non-GAAP loss stands at 39 cents per share, suggesting a drastic fall from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of a penny. We expect Twilio to report a loss of 38 cents per share in the third quarter of 2022.Twilio’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 64.1%.Twilio Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Twilio Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTwilio Inc. price-eps-surprise | Twilio Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteTwilio’s third-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from accelerated digital transformation projects across several industries amid the ongoing pandemic. Organizations have been reconfiguring their setup for a hybrid operational environment.The company’s revenues are likely to have witnessed contributions from its latest buyouts, including Zipwhip and Segment. Since the buyout in 2020, Segment has been aiding TWLO in enhancing its capabilities in the cloud-based communications platform space and gaining significant customers. The strong uptake of Segment, the growing adoption of Twilio Flex and an increasing clientele base are likely to have favored the third-quarter performance.Solutions like Journeys, Twilio Conversations, SendGrid Ads and SendGrid’s Email Validation application programming interface are likely to have contributed to the third-quarter performance. The company’s efforts to fortify its global footprint are likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter's results.Story continuesIn the last reported quarter, Twilio added around 7,000 new clients, taking the total active customer count to more than 275,000. In the third quarter, the company’s increasing scope among leading enterprises is likely to have acted as a key tailwind.However, increased spending, investments in enhancing the product portfolio and expansion across newer markets are likely to have negatively impacted Twilio’s profitability. Also, elevated expenses for enhancing sales capabilities are likely to have weighed on the third quarter’s bottom line.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Twilio this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.TWLO currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The company is anticipated to report its third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 21. Pyxis’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed twice, the negative average surprise being 30.1%.

The consensus mark for revenues stands at $16.4 million, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 134%. Helmerich &amp; Payne has an Earnings ESP of +14.32% and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company is slated to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 16. Helmerich &amp; Payne’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 118.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HP’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings stands at 43 cents per share, implying a year-over-year increase of 169.4%.

QuoteFactors to ConsiderCloudflare’s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from solid demand for security solutions, which became imperative due to aggravated cyberattacks, work and learn-from-home policies and a zero-trust approach.The to-be-reported quarter’s top line is likely to have witnessed the impact of the accelerated global footprint expansion outside of the United States. It is worth mentioning that the United States, the EMEA and the APAC represented 53%, 26% and 14% of total revenues, respectively, in the second quarter.Besides this, a diversified customer base is likely to have contributed to NET’s third-quarter top line. It added around 3,619 new paying customers in the last reported quarter, bringing the total count to approximately 151,803 across more than 170 countries.Cloudflare added 212 new large customers (annual billings of more than $100,000), taking the total count to 1,749 at the end of the second quarter, up from 1,537 recorded at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This uptrend, which has prevailed for the past few quarters, is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well, backed by the elevated demand for its cloud-based solutions amid the ongoing remote-working trend.Story continuesThe company's recurring subscription-based business model has been providing relative stability to its top line amid post-pandemic disruptions. It expects variability in cash flow margins due to working capital fluctuations, large enterprise business growth and seasonal factors.However, Cloudflare’s significant exposure to small and medium businesses, the worst-hit cohorts by the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, is likely to have weighed on its performance in the quarter to be reported.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NET this season.

Investors' appetite for more sophisticated ESG reporting has spurred organizations to rethink and evolve their ESG reporting strategy, optimize processes, and disclose proactively, deeply, and consistently. Companies within and across sectors are raising the ESG bar with greater transparency and a commensurate focus on underlying performance. Whether your goal is to be recognized as an ESG leader, function as a well-governed company that manages ESG risks and opportunities, or simply avoid the bottom quartile of ESG ratings, you can advance your reporting strategy.This blog outlines the major industry trends driving organizations toward more advanced ESG reporting. It also provides recommendations to not only meet investors' needs, but to leverage ESG reporting to improve performance, compete more effectively, establish leadership positioning, manage risk, and build a more resilient organization.The Changing ESG LandscapeEvery leading investment firm is or soon will be covering ESG.Investments. Interest in ESG investing across all asset classes shows no sign of slowing down. In 2020, 85% of CFA Institute members said they consider ESG in their investing.1 The number of professional investors implementing ESG has grown 18% since 2018.2 Leading asset managers now delineate disclosure requirements, often recommending or even mandating corporate disclosure in accordance with third-party disclosure frameworks, and may augment third-party research with their own.Raters. The rater and framework landscape continues to evolve. Leading ESG-focused research and rating organizations are still extremely important to the investment community. Investors increasingly consider other factors beyond ratings and scores, and may focus on raters' underlying data and analysis.Story continuesPublic disclosure. Many raters expect some data to be publicly available for consideration or credit. This gives you the opportunity to focus on providing information in the public domain, as well as your data provision process and materiality assessment work. The number -- and adoption of -- public disclosure frameworks has mushroomed in recent years.Advanced ESG Reporting: Crucial Priorities to ConsiderOrganizations are being pushed toward more advanced ESG reporting. It is no longer enough to undertake any of these steps alone:Responding to rater questionnairesProviding or verifying data sought by ratersAddressing leading public disclosure frameworksDisclosing ESG informationGenerating corporate responsibility or sustainability reportsESG reporting is not a linear evolution, and it doesn't follow a step-by-step progression. Every organization must prioritize what it will focus on based on its own strategy, company, culture, and appetite to enhance its reporting. Additionally, your company should remain cognizant of what your peers are doing to avoid being labeled as a laggard by investors and rating organizations.Here are five considerations for advancing your ESG reporting.1. Approach ESG reporting as a continuous, incremental improvement processFirst and foremost: no matter where you are in your ESG reporting progression, you must continually identify those topics and metrics that matter not only to investors and raters, but also to your customers, employees, vendors, and other key stakeholders.Periodically review both the internal and external benefits of your disclosure, including:Your proactive public reportingYour reactive responses to research and rating organizations' ESG metrics or questionnaires andThird-party disclosure frameworksConsider how you can leverage all three.Use the lens of ESG raters and frameworks to identify, hone, and assess ESG issues and metrics. Determine which topics and metrics are one-offs and which ones are emerging themes to monitor.To prioritize which ESG topics you report on, revisit your overall reporting objectives. Verify that they align with your short-term and long-term goals. For example, you can set internal goals to achieve ESG outcomes or to gain leadership recognition through a prestigious index, rating, membership, or disclosure benchmark.While disclosure alone is critical, consider how you can leverage your disclosure data to improve your overall business performance. Selecting metrics and data closely correlated with business objectives will foster accountability and clearly communicate priorities across your organization. Embed disclosure and response management into your continuous improvement processes.As you undertake periodic materiality assessments with different lenses into the issues and metrics that could affect your company and stakeholders, use these learnings to inform your strategy, goals, targets, and disclosures. Align your reporting objectives with performance objectives, whether internal or external.The types of investors you most want to attract will likely change over time. Consider the strategies and disclosure plans needed to attract a bigger pool of investors and improve your performance.2. Better leverage research organizations, rating agencies, and disclosure frameworksThink strategically about which rating organizations matter to you and the ESG ratings landscape as these will change over time. You'll need to include big players, such as MSCI and Sustainalytics, and consider including other leading or sector-specific raters and frameworks as well to bolster your reporting. If eligible, consider industry-centric raters such as S&amp;P's Corporate Sustainability Assessment for Dow Jones Sustainability Index to benchmark your performance.Consider these attributes for each rating organization and framework:The rating organization's direct or indirect influence on a high percentage of assets under management (investor reach)Whether the rating organization manages an indexRating organization or framework influence, prestige, and rate of adoptionAbility to address a specific strategic stakeholder groupTo get the most out of your relationship with external research and rating organizations, share your ESG information proactively with them. Know which ones assess you, whether the assessment occurs with or without your participation, and the information sources they reference.3. Enhance the scope and depth of your reportingMeasure what matters. Typical industry metrics may not tell your company's ESG story as well as you would like. That's when it's time to think about creating custom metrics, which highlight how you measure KPIs and performance. The goal is to augment disclosure rather than avoid key disclosures.With the availability of a broad spectrum of third-party ratings, custom metrics are not a requirement. However, they are worth considering as you advance your ESG reporting practices. In fact, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) encourages organizations to include custom topics and metrics, opening the door for you to incorporate metrics specific to your organization into your GRI reporting.Companies at the forefront of ESG reporting are likely to develop innovative custom metrics. Use custom metrics to disclose to investors your unique competitive advantage and to reflect the metrics that matter to your firm and stakeholders.Seeking transparency into your supply chain is an increasingly good business practice as it arms you with information regarding your company's broader impacts. Be specific about expectations for your suppliers and codify those expectations for standardized reporting.Broaden internal engagement to gain different perspectives and enhance your ESG reporting scope and depth. Rather than relying solely on one or two leads for reporting, leverage subject matter experts across your organization to aggregate diverse perspectives and create a holistic approach.Including data from across the organization in your ESG reporting also improves employee engagement by expanding accountability and distributing the workload. More engagement does mean that you will need to simplify oversight and maintain control by implementing structured tools for assigning and overseeing work.Messaging consistency is critical. Focus not only on your communications strategy, but your overall ESG strategy. Synchronize the two by paying attention to-and reporting on-both risks and opportunities.4. Streamline, automate, and improve reporting processes Many organizations struggle with the workload and time-sensitivity of ESG reporting. While the resources required for report planning, data collection, oversight, and disclosure are substantial, automation makes this process as efficient as possible.Streamline and simplify processes and workflows with software tools and partners that allow you to do more with less.It's often challenging to cross-reference metrics among different rating organizations and frameworks for different reporting needs, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). However, tapping resources that embed this information can lessen duplicative disclosure work and lower the hurdle to taking on additional frameworks and ratings by leveraging commonalities across your disclosures.Automation allows you to collect data previously siloed throughout the organization for a more complete picture of your ESG efforts and successes. Automation also helps ensure that as your ESG team grows and adds more key players, your organization preserves institutional memory, maintains information consistency, and makes the insights of past processes and decisions available to all team members.5. Apply the same rigor to ESG reporting as you do to financial reportingOver time, ESG reporting will likely be subject to the same level of scrutiny and auditability as conventional financial reporting. Some global regions and industries have already established heavily regulated metrics.It's critical to have systems and processes in place to add rigor to data reporting and close the gap between financial and ESG reporting.Align your financial disclosures, such as annual reports, 10Ks, proxies, and earnings calls, with your ESG public disclosures. While many companies currently report risks differently in their 10K than in their ESG disclosures, investors expect consistency -- if not convergence -- of messaging across different disclosure vehicles. They will increasingly hold companies accountable for inconsistencies or big omissions. Proactive alignment will help you prepare to meet those expectations.Third-party verification is emerging as a best practice. This verification ensures data is accurate before public release, and lessens the likelihood of rating organizations needing to ask you to correct or augment data. At a minimum, tune processes and apply internal auditing rigor to reported data.Verifying data decreases the risk of expensive litigation that can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars due to inaccuracies or errors, bolsters trust, and can reduce the cost associated with proxy proposals. Select portions of data to audit rather than all data to manage cost. Only 3% of organizations verify all their ESG data with external third parties, while 36% rely on partial third-party verification.3 Choosing quantifiable rather than qualitative data will make the process less onerous and costly. Provide restatements when necessary.Advancing ESG Reporting with Nasdaq OneReportStrategic ESG reporting and disclosure requires time, dedication, and expertise.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and dividend investing, you can go directly to our article This Is the Best Time to Buy These 5 Long-Term Dividend Stocks.For the long-term, tax-paying investor, strategic investment policies focusing on passive income are the ones that work the best. Investment portfolios including reliable dividend stocks have the potential to deliver strong long-term returns even if the market is unfavorable to most stocks. In addition, the fact that a company is able to consistently pay a dividend, while also raising its payouts year after year, is generally a sign that the company has stronger balance sheets and profitability relative to non-dividend-paying companies.As a result of the above, stable dividend stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have typically been among the few securities investors never grow tired of. This is because dividends account for over 40% of a company's total return. This has been an observable trend over more than 90 years until 2015, according to a Morgan Stanley publication on dividend investing. These stocks have also historically outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts. From 1991 to 2015, dividend stocks outperformed non-dividend-payers, since the former had an average annual return of 9.7% while the latter's average annual return was 4.18%. Additionally, those stocks which consistently raise their yields annually also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 benchmark in 17 out of the 23 years between 1991 and 2015.A BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund report from this April also showed that in 2022, dividend stocks comprising this fund outperformed the broad S&amp;P 500 over the 12-month period that ended April 30. Additionally, according to a Barron's article published this May, between 1999 and 2019, dividend-payers with higher payout ratios had an annual return of 10.9%, compared to a 6.6% annual return for those companies with low payout ratios.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on UnsplashMethodologyWe picked strong dividend stocks that also have long-term growth potential. These companies are defensive plays that are positioned to stray strong during the tough economic situation heading towards us in 2023 and beyond. That's why analysts believe now is the right time to pile into these stocks.Long-Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Right Now10.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Dividend Yield as of November 1: 2.55%Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is another consumer staples company on our list, operating through its Oral, Personal and Home Care, and Pet Nutrition segments. The company offers products such as toothpaste, mouthwash, bar, and liquid hand soaps, and more.

Third Point Investors acquired a large position in  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in October, stating that the company is defensive and had significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. It also has specific businesses that are highly profitable, such as Hill's Pet Nutrition business.

Here's what the firm said:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

Some predict a recession and blame it on the Federal Reserve's (Fed) upcoming interest rate increases, while others blame the gigantic valuations of major tech companies. Whatever it may be, the stock market is presently quite volatile. Uncertainty levels are at an all-time high as the Fed fights against inflation and a weakening economy. The Fed cannot deploy quantitative easing to boost the economy, unlike in 2008 and 2020. Inflation will only get worse if this is done.However, just because there is uncertainty in the stock market doesn't mean investors should stay out. Contrarily, historically speaking, bear markets have been a great investment opportunity. Additionally, investors have choices on how to put their money to work. Buy safe investments to weather the short-term storm and steadily increase your wealth over time if you don't have the stomach for more volatility or danger.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:We turn to the smart money to see how they are playing the current turmoil.

Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”09.

Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”08.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”06.

(NYSE: PRU) today reported third quarter results. Net loss attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. was $284 million ($0.78 per Common share) for the third quarter of 2022, compared to net income of $1.530 billion ($3.90 per Common share) for the third quarter of 2021. After-tax adjusted operating income was $803 million ($2.13 per Common share) for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $1.487 billion ($3.78 per Common share) for the third quarter of 2021.Consolidated adjusted operating income and adjusted book value are non-GAAP measures. A discussion of these measures, including definitions thereof, how they are useful to investors, and certain limitations thereof, is included later in this press release under ""Non-GAAP Measures"" and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the tables that accompany this release.RESULTS OF ONGOING OPERATIONSThe Company’s ongoing operations include PGIM, U.S. Businesses, International Businesses, and Corporate &amp; Other. In the following business-level discussion, adjusted operating income refers to pre-tax results.PGIMPGIM, the Company’s global investment management business, reported adjusted operating income of $219 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $327 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease primarily reflects lower asset management fees, driven by a reduction in assets under management.PGIM assets under management of $1.206 trillion were down 20% from the year-ago quarter, resulting from higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, as well as declines in equity markets. Third-party net outflows of $4.0 billion in the current quarter reflect $4.6 billion of retail outflows mainly from fixed income, partially offset by institutional inflows of $0.6 billion, primarily driven by real estate strategies.U.S. BusinessesU.S. Businesses reported adjusted operating income of $702 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $1.090 billion in the year-ago quarter. This decrease primarily reflects lower net investment spread results, driven by lower variable investment income, and lower net fee income, partially offset by more favorable underwriting results.Retirement Strategies, consisting of Institutional Retirement Strategies and Individual Retirement Strategies, reported adjusted operating income of $678 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $1.070 billion in the year-ago quarter.Institutional Retirement Strategies:Reported adjusted operating income of $233 million in the current quarter, compared to $571 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower net investment spread results, driven by lower variable investment income, partially offset by higher reserve gains.Account values of $238 billion declined 3% from the year-ago quarter, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and market depreciation. Net inflows in the current quarter totaled $9.8 billion, driven by $9.7 billion of funded pension risk transfer transactions, including being selected for a 50% participation in the second largest pension risk transfer transaction in U.S. market history.Individual Retirement Strategies:Reported adjusted operating income of $445 million in the current quarter, compared to $499 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower fee income, net of distribution expenses and other associated costs, driven by a reduction in account values, partially offset by higher net investment spread results.Account values of $116 billion were down 35% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting the sale of a block of legacy variable annuities, market depreciation, and net outflows. Gross sales of $1.4 billion in the current quarter reflect the continued momentum from our FlexGuard products and increased sales of fixed annuity products.Group Insurance:Reported adjusted operating income of $27 million in the current quarter, compared to a net operating loss of $135 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase reflects more favorable underwriting results in both group life and disability, partially offset by lower net investment spread results.Reported earned premiums, policy charges, and fees of $1.4 billion were consistent with the year-ago quarter.Individual Life:Reported adjusted operating income of $41 million in the current quarter, compared to $210 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease primarily reflects lower net investment spread results, driven by lower variable investment income.Sales of $150 million in the current quarter decreased 21% from the year-ago quarter, driven by lower Variable Life sales.Assurance IQ reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $44 million in the current quarter, compared to a loss of $55 million in the year-ago quarter. This reflects lower expenses, partially offset by lower revenues, driven by less case referral income.International BusinessesInternational Businesses, consisting of Life Planner and Gibraltar Life &amp; Other, reported adjusted operating income of $430 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $887 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease primarily reflects less favorable underwriting results and lower net investment spread results, driven by lower variable investment income.Life Planner:Reported adjusted operating income of $254 million in the current quarter, compared to $475 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects less favorable underwriting results, driven by COVID-19 and unfavorable policyholder behavior in Japan, and lower net investment spread results, driven by lower variable investment income.Constant dollar basis sales(3) of $241 million in the current quarter increased 2% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by growth in Brazil.Gibraltar Life &amp; Other:Reported adjusted operating income of $176 million in the current quarter, compared to $412 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower net investment spread results, driven by lower variable investment income, and less favorable underwriting results driven by COVID-19 in Japan.Constant dollar basis sales(3) of $206 million in the current quarter decreased 24% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by lower protection product sales in the Bank and Life Consultant channels.Corporate &amp; OtherCorporate &amp; Other reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $325 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to a loss of $460 million in the year-ago quarter. This lower loss reflects the absence of costs related to the early extinguishment of debt in the year-ago quarter, gains from the sales of certain home office properties, favorable foreign exchange rate impacts, and higher income from pension and other employee benefit plans.NET INCOMENet loss in the current quarter included $1.464 billion of pre-tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments, largely reflecting the impacts of rising interest rates, including $75 million of pre-tax net impairment and credit-related losses, $100 million of pre-tax losses from divested and run-off businesses, and $133 million of pre-tax gains related to market experience updates.Net income for the year-ago quarter included $199 million of pre-tax losses related to market experience updates, $98 million of pre-tax net realized investment gains and related charges and adjustments, including $17 million of pre-tax net impairment and credit-related losses, and $75 million of pre-tax earnings from divested and run-off businesses.EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALLMembers of Prudential’s senior management will host a conference call on Wednesday, November 2, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss with the investment community the Company’s third quarter results.

Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Prudential Financial, Inc.’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements. Certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements can be found in the ""Risk Factors"" and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" sections included in Prudential Financial, Inc.’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements herein are subject to the risk, among others, that we will be unable to execute our strategy because of market or competitive conditions or other factors. Prudential Financial, Inc. does not undertake to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document.NON-GAAP MEASURESConsolidated adjusted operating income and adjusted book value are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this release.We believe that our use of these non-GAAP measures helps investors understand and evaluate the Company’s performance and financial position. The presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described below. Adjusted book value augments the understanding of our financial position by providing a measure of net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations separate from the portion that is affected by capital and currency market conditions, and by isolating the accounting impact associated with insurance liabilities that are generally not marked to market and the supporting investments that are marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income under GAAP. However, these non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for income and equity determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive these measures are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial position. The schedules accompanying this release provide reconciliations of non-GAAP measures with the corresponding measures calculated using GAAP. Additional historic information relating to our financial performance is located on our website at investor.prudential.com.Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure used by the Company to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. Adjusted operating income excludes ""Realized investment gains (losses), net,"" as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.Realized investment gains (losses) within certain businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments, are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an asset-liability management program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are designated as trading. Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes the changes in fair value of equity securities that are recorded in net income.Adjusted operating income excludes market experience updates, reflecting the immediate impacts in current period results from changes in current market conditions on estimates of profitability, which we believe enhances the understanding of underlying performance trends. Adjusted operating income also excludes the results of Divested and Run-off Businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations, and discontinued operations and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, each of which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes other items, such as certain components of the consideration for acquisitions, which are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, and goodwill impairments. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP and excluded from adjusted operating income. The tax effect associated with pre-tax adjusted operating income is based on applicable IRS and foreign tax regulations inclusive of pertinent adjustments.Adjusted operating income does not equate to ""Net income"" as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described above.Adjusted book value is calculated as total equity (GAAP book value) excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the cumulative effect of foreign currency exchange rate remeasurements and currency translation adjustments corresponding to realized investment gains and losses. These items are excluded in order to highlight the book value attributable to our core business operations separate from the portion attributable to external and potentially volatile capital and currency market conditions.FOOTNOTES(1)Highly liquid assets predominantly include cash, short-term investments, U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of other U.S. government authorities and agencies, and/or foreign government bonds.

The data-centric platform with integrated applications delivers unified user access to outage management (OMS), distribution management (DMS), and distributed energy resource management (DERMS). Oracle Utilities NMS Flex Operations (FlexOps) securely extends outage management and dispatch capabilities beyond the control room.With the growing unpredictability of extreme weather events and the emergence of evolving distributed energy resources (DERs), FirstEnergy was interested in replacing its existing outage management system with a modern grid management platform that could scale and evolve with its business, customers, and regulatory demands. Oracle Utilities NMS offers extensive functionality and reliable support for outage management, switching, power flow analysis, and distribution automation processes. This includes integrated Volt Var control for more efficient energy savings across its network. In total, FirstEnergy now has more than 200 circuits running DMS advanced apps with unified DER awareness.Story continues""Ensuring our communities and customers get the electricity they need is our top priority and leveraging technology to improve system reliability plays a crucial role in meeting this objective,"" said Ted Allan, director, ADMS/GIS Project, FirstEnergy. ""We are very proud of our project team who completed the Oracle go-live across all 10 operating companies, making this a successful initiative in terms of cost, schedule, and functionality. With the new system in place, we expect our customers will benefit from improved outage response and enhanced system reliability.""Providing automated, self-healing support, Oracle's Fault Location, Isolation, Service Restoration (FLISR) Application in NMS enables utilities to sectionalize outage impact, reduce outage duration, and increase service reliability. The solution can scale across millions of customers and support integration of distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and battery storage. In addition, the Oracle NMS Operations Mobile Application enables faster response for field crews in emergency situations to quickly assess and mitigate network damages. Finally, Oracle Utilities Live Energy Connect (LEC), an OT-centric middleware platform that supports all major protocols (e.g., ICCP, OPC, and DNP3), provides essential, technology-agnostic integration with utilities' existing SCADA systems and can support future scaling options.""Oracle NMS has evolved over decades of working in tandem with the world's largest utilities to enable them to quite literally weather whatever mother nature sends their way,"" said Brad Williams, vice president, Oracle Energy and Water. ""With NMS, FirstEnergy utility operations teams will have access to accurate, timely, and reliable information critical to help meet modern grid operations challenges from anywhere. NMS will help effectively maximize grid operations, shorten outage impact, and optimize distribution, all while keeping customers engaged and informed.""To learn more about Oracle Energy and Water solutions visit: https://www.oracle.com/industries/utilities/network-management-system/About FirstEnergyFirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this self-storage facility real estate investment trust would post FFO of $3.92 per share when it actually produced FFO of $3.99, delivering a surprise of 1.79%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Public Storage , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $1.09 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.94%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $894.93 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Public Storage shares have lost about 17.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Public Storage?While Public Storage has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Public Storage: mixed.

""Our digital innovation centers on enhanced customer service, which has contributed to direct operating margins in excess of 80%, the highest in the self-storage industry. The recent acquisition, development, and redevelopment properties comprise more than 50 million square feet, or 25% of the portfolio, and are generating significant growth. And our long-standing focus on utilizing a disciplined balance sheet provides exceptional capital access to execute on a wide set of potential opportunities in the evolving macro environment.

Subsequent to September 30, 2022, we acquired or were under contract to acquire 33 self-storage facilities with 1.7 million net rentable square feet, for $262.6 million.Opened five newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects with 0.5 million net rentable square feet costing $69.7 million. At September 30, 2022, we had various facilities in development and expansion with 5.1 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $1.0 billion.Story continuesDistributed a one-time dividend of $13.15 per common share totaling $2.3 billion in August 2022, in connection with the sale of our equity investment of PS Business Park, Inc. (""PSB""), upon completion of its merger transaction with the affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate (""Blackstone"") on July 20, 2022.Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022For the three months ended September 30, 2022, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $2,712.2 million or $15.38 per diluted common share, compared to $442.3 million or $2.52 per diluted common share in 2021, representing an increase of $2,269.9 million or $12.86 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB, (ii) a $148.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income, and (iii) a $59.3 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable, partially offset by (iv) a $32.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, (v) a $24.7 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to the sale of our equity investment in PSB, and (vi) a $10.4 million increase in interest expense.The $148.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $91.9 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $56.5 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 14.7% or $105.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 7.7% or $13.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, due primarily to increased property tax expense, marketing expense, other direct property costs, and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $56.5 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $3,779.7 million or $21.44 per diluted common share, compared to $1,174.4 million or $6.70 per diluted common share in 2021, representing an increase of $2,605.3 million or $14.74 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB, (ii) a $476.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income, and (iii) a $163.7 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable, partially offset by (iv) a $153.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and (v) a $39.2 million increase in interest expense.The $476.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $283.2 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $193.4 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 15.4% or $315.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 6.2% or $32.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, due primarily to increased property tax expense, on-site property manager payroll expense, other direct property costs, and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $193.4 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFunds from Operations (""FFO"") and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. FFO represents net income before depreciation and amortization, which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.For the three months ended September 30, 2022, FFO was $4.66 per diluted common share as compared to $3.61 in the same period in 2021, representing an increase of 29.1%.For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, FFO was $13.08 per diluted common share, as compared to $9.69 in the same period in 2021, representing an increase of 35.0%.We also present ""Core FFO"" and ""Core FFO per share,"" non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing, with respect to the periods presented below, the impact of loss contingency accruals and casualties, unrealized gain on private equity investments and our equity share of merger transaction costs, severance of a senior executive, and casualties from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such measures, Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles net income to FFO and Core FFO and reconciles diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and Core FFO per share (unaudited):Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,20222021PercentageChange20222021PercentageChange(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO and Core FFO:Net income allocable to common shareholders$2,712,161$442,327513.2%$3,779,666$1,174,386221.8%Eliminate items excluded from FFO:Depreciation and amortization218,963187,611657,131505,218Depreciation from unconsolidated real estate investments10,59919,20944,98554,485Depreciation allocated to noncontrolling interests and restricted share unitholders(1,843)(1,318)(4,841)(3,413)Gains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investments(1,219)(12,572)(54,403)(31,156)Gain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc.(2,116,839)—(2,116,839)—FFO allocable to common shares$821,822$635,25729.4%$2,305,699$1,699,52035.7%Eliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investments:Foreign currency exchange gain(100,170)(40,906)(237,270)(73,584)Preferred share redemption charge———16,989Property losses and tenant claims due to casualties (a)6,1184,9096,1184,909Other items(344)2,000422(543)Core FFO allocable to common shares$727,426$601,26021.0%$2,074,969$1,647,29126.0%Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Share to FFO per Share and Core FFO per Share:Diluted Earnings per share$15.38$2.52510.3%$21.44$6.70220.0%Eliminate amounts per share excluded from FFO:Depreciation and amortization1.291.173.953.17Gains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investments(0.01)(0.08)(0.31)(0.18)Gain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc.(12.00)—(12.00)—FFO per share$4.66$3.6129.1%$13.08$9.6935.0%Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investments:Foreign currency exchange gain(0.57)(0.23)(1.35)(0.42)Preferred share redemption charge———0.10Property losses and tenant claims due to casualties (a)0.040.030.040.03Other items—0.01—(0.01)Core FFO per share$4.13$3.4220.8%$11.77$9.3925.3%Diluted weighted average common shares176,328175,806176,325175,398(a)Property losses and tenant claims due to casualties were related to Hurricane Ian for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, and Hurricane Ida for the same periods in 2021, and were included in general and administrative expenses and ancillary cost of operations on the Selected Consolidated Income Statement Data.Property Operations – Same Store FacilitiesThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues, and cost of operations since January 1, 2020. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities, which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However, because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such a measure, Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,282 facilities (149.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 74% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at September 30, 2022 (unaudited):Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,20222021PercentageChange20222021PercentageChange(Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per square foot data)Revenues (a):Rental income$795,700$695,55614.4%$2,286,214$1,984,05315.2%Late charges and administrative fees26,82721,55324.5%74,52160,79822.6%Total revenues822,527717,10914.7%2,360,7352,044,85115.4%Direct cost of operations (a):Property taxes72,71670,0213.8%213,947204,2874.7%On-site property manager payroll29,53828,1894.8%89,76982,5838.7%Repairs and maintenance14,60513,12111.3%43,35039,24910.4%Utilities12,02011,1338.0%33,60931,3087.3%Marketing12,4929,18036.1%32,38030,6535.6%Other direct property costs20,89018,89410.6%61,20955,56910.1%Total direct cost of operations162,261150,5387.8%474,264443,6496.9%Direct net operating income (b)660,266566,57116.5%1,886,4711,601,20217.8%Indirect cost of operations (a):Supervisory payroll(8,329)(8,362)(0.4)%(26,635)(27,906)(4.6)%Centralized management costs(16,058)(13,808)16.3%(46,382)(40,136)15.6%Share-based compensation(3,309)(3,736)(11.4)%(10,936)(13,825)(20.9)%Net operating income (c)$632,570$540,66517.0%$1,802,518$1,519,33518.6%Gross margin (before indirect costs, depreciation and amortization expense)80.3%79.0%1.6%79.9%78.3%2.0%Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense)76.9%75.4%2.0%76.4%74.3%2.8%Weighted average for the period:Square foot occupancy94.5%96.8%(2.4)%95.3%96.5%(1.2)%Realized annual rental income per (d):Occupied square foot$22.52$19.2217.2%$21.39$18.3416.6%Available square foot$21.28$18.6014.4%$20.39$17.6915.3%At September 30:Square foot occupancy93.3%95.7%(2.5)%Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e)$22.94$19.4917.7%(a)Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities.(b)Direct net operating income (""Direct NOI""), a subtotal within NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll, centralized management costs, and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors.(c)See attached reconciliation of self-storage NOI to net income.(d)Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (""REVPAF"") is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.(e)Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in, and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.Property Operations – Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2,282 Same Store Facilities, we have 554 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies, revenues, or cost of operations since January 1, 2020 or that we did not own as of January 1, 2020, including 338 facilities that were acquired, 59 newly developed facilities, 91 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion, and 66 facilities that are unstabilized because they are undergoing fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively, the ""Non-Same Store Facilities""). Operating data, metrics, and further commentary with respect to these facilities, including detail by vintage, are included in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" under ""Analysis of Net Income – Self-Storage Operations"" in our September 30, 2022 Form 10-Q.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended September 30, 2022, we acquired 24 self-storage facilities (ten in Oklahoma, three in South Carolina, two each in Alabama and Texas, and one each in Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina and Ohio) with 1.7 million net rentable square feet for $250.6 million.

The remaining $605.5 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.On April 24, 2022, PSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby affiliates of Blackstone agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of PSB’s common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. On July 20, 2022, PSB announced that it completed the merger transaction with Blackstone. Each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest we held in PSB were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $187.50 per share or unit, including a $5.25 closing cash dividend per share or unit, and a $0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit, for a total of $187.72 per share or unit. At the close of the merger transaction, we received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a gain of $2.1 billion, which was classified within gain on sale of our equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. in the Consolidated Statement of Income.In connection with the sale of our equity investment in PSB, on August 4, 2022, we paid a special cash dividend of $13.15 per common share, totaling approximately $2.3 billion, to shareholders of record as of August 1, 2022.On August 15, 2022, the Company redeemed its 2.370% Senior Notes due September 15, 2022, with an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million.Distributions DeclaredOn October 26, 2022, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on December 29, 2022 to shareholders of record as of December 14, 2022.Outlook for the Year Ending December 31, 2022The following table outlines the Company’s Core FFO per share estimate and certain underlying assumptions for the year ending December 31, 2022, including the impact of the sale of our investment in PSB to Blackstone on July 20, 2022:Guidance Ranges for 2022LowHigh(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)Same Store:Revenue growth13.50%15.00%Expense growth6.00%8.00%Net operating income growth15.40%18.00%Acquisitions$800,000Development openings$250,000Non-Same Store net operating income$500,000$510,000Ancillary net operating income$160,000$165,000General and administrative expense$105,000$111,000Interest expense$140,000Preferred dividends$195,000Capital expenditures$400,000$450,000Core FFO per share (before the impact of the sale of PSB)$15.57$15.97Impact of the sale of PSB(0.22)(0.22)Core FFO per share$15.35$15.75Incremental Non-Same Store NOI to stabilization (2023 and beyond)$157,000Forward-looking Core FFO per share measures exclude estimates for the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iii) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items such as loss contingency accruals, casualties, transactional due diligence, and advisory costs. Public Storage is unable to provide a reconciliation of Core FFO per share guidance measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future U.S. GAAP results.Third Quarter Conference CallA conference call is scheduled for November 2, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. (PDT) to discuss the third quarter earnings results.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 8, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of scientific instruments is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -38.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.02 billion, down 12.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PerkinElmer?For PerkinElmer, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that PerkinElmer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PerkinElmer would post earnings of $2.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.32, delivering a surprise of +14.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PerkinElmer appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry, Mettler-Toledo (MTD), is soon expected to post earnings of $9.83 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +12.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $974.94 million, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Mettler-Toledo has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.08%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mettler-Toledo will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $2.66 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.72%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of products used in drug discovery and development would post earnings of $2.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.75, delivering a surprise of 4.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Waters , which belongs to the Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry, posted revenues of $708.56 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.15%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $659.23 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Waters shares have lost about 19.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Waters?While Waters has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Waters: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.87 on $843.56 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.96 on $2.93 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Instruments - Scientific is currently in the bottom 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Mettler-Toledo (MTD), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.

Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Diebold Nixdorf?For Diebold Nixdorf, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Diebold Nixdorf will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Diebold Nixdorf would post a loss of $0.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.38, delivering a surprise of +272.73%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Diebold Nixdorf doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.75 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.61 billion, up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Fidelity National has been revised 1.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.33%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fidelity National will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.16 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -14.29%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this restaurant operator would post earnings of $0.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.11, delivering a surprise of -21.43%.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.Denny's , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, posted revenues of $117.46 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.02%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $103.79 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Denny's shares have lost about 29.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Denny's?While Denny's has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Denny's: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.16 on $117.1 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.51 on $449.21 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Restaurants is currently in the top 19% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Yum Brands (YUM), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 2.This parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Yum Brands' revenues are expected to be $1.64 billion, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Some of the top stocks to consider in this context include Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), among others discussed in detail below. These firms are also working on the incorporation of artificial intelligence into the food business, and voice-command features for ordering food are also becoming increasingly popular. These features come with programmed recommendations. In the fast food world, eateries are also offering voice recognition features to remember preferences from previous orders. In addition, restaurants are expanding the menus for kids, considering that more and more parents are shifting to organic and healthier options for children. Healthy sweeteners and flour alternatives are important market forces that investors should monitor before investing in the sector. Per data by digital agency Linchpin, digital orders at restaurants around the United States are expected to triple in 2023.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and dividend investing, you can go directly to our article This Is the Best Time to Buy These 5 Long-Term Dividend Stocks.For the long-term, tax-paying investor, strategic investment policies focusing on passive income are the ones that work the best. Investment portfolios including reliable dividend stocks have the potential to deliver strong long-term returns even if the market is unfavorable to most stocks. In addition, the fact that a company is able to consistently pay a dividend, while also raising its payouts year after year, is generally a sign that the company has stronger balance sheets and profitability relative to non-dividend-paying companies.As a result of the above, stable dividend stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have typically been among the few securities investors never grow tired of. This is because dividends account for over 40% of a company's total return. This has been an observable trend over more than 90 years until 2015, according to a Morgan Stanley publication on dividend investing. These stocks have also historically outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts. From 1991 to 2015, dividend stocks outperformed non-dividend-payers, since the former had an average annual return of 9.7% while the latter's average annual return was 4.18%. Additionally, those stocks which consistently raise their yields annually also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 benchmark in 17 out of the 23 years between 1991 and 2015.A BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund report from this April also showed that in 2022, dividend stocks comprising this fund outperformed the broad S&amp;P 500 over the 12-month period that ended April 30. Additionally, according to a Barron's article published this May, between 1999 and 2019, dividend-payers with higher payout ratios had an annual return of 10.9%, compared to a 6.6% annual return for those companies with low payout ratios.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on UnsplashMethodologyWe picked strong dividend stocks that also have long-term growth potential.

The company offers products such as toothpaste, mouthwash, bar, and liquid hand soaps, and more.

Third Point Investors acquired a large position in  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in October, stating that the company is defensive and had significant pricing power in inflationary conditions.

Overall, 50 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $2.6 billion.Third Point, a New York-based investment advisor, mentioned  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

Rowe Price Foundation Releases First “State of the Baltimore Nonprofit Sector” Report,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-foundation-releases-130500880.html,1667394300,STORY,['TROW'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 2, 2022 / The T. Rowe Price Foundation today announced the release of its ""2022 State of the Baltimore Nonprofit Sector"" report, providing data and insights into the health and capacity of Baltimore's nonprofit community. The report details 10 key insights covering topics pertinent to sustaining effective organizations within the nonprofit sector, including partnerships, diversity, fundraising, technology, and more. This report is available for reading and downloading here.Those 10 key insights are:Partnerships are the key to strong organizations.The nonprofit leadership pipeline remains tenuous at best.Effective capacity building requires organizations to dig deep into financial realities and sometimes face hard truths.To increase funding, organizations need dedicated staff and capacity to support it.The best expense is technology.When it comes to evaluation practices, it is better to focus on learning, not counting.There's a difference between having a strategic plan and being a strategic organization.Effective management can result in stronger programs and increased revenue streams.To achieve diversity in leadership, it's imperative to target recruitment and advancement efforts.Reimagine the governance structure.The ""State of the Baltimore Nonprofit Sector Report"" is a result of years of collaboration between the T. Rowe Price Foundation and dozens of community partners throughout the city of Baltimore. Findings presented within the report results from a compilation of a variety of sources, including an economic analysis conducted by SeaChange Capital Partners, a review of iCAT (Impact Capacity Assessment Tool), and fundraising audit data submitted by several dozen organizations throughout Baltimore since 2016, which also includes analyses of financial audit and 990 data and feedback from local nonprofit leaders and staff using the Race to Lead (RacetoLead.org) and Daring to Lead survey tools.Story continuesTo analyze the financial health of the nonprofit sector in Baltimore, the T. Rowe Price Foundation engaged SeaChange Capital Partners to review data from 1,723 of the city's nonprofit organizations that electronically filed their 990 forms in one or more years from 2014 to 2019. Aside from year-over-year comparisons of select metrics, the analysis mostly focused on 2019 990 data submitted by a core group of 731 organizations with total expenses of $2.7 billion. More than half of these organizations-both by number and total expenses-are in the health and human services or community capacity sectors. Of these 731 organizations, almost two-thirds had expenses less than $1 million.Beginning in 2015, the T. Rowe Price Foundation began engaging with community-based leaders throughout the city of Baltimore to understand how they hoped to make positive change. Through these conversations, Baltimore residents reported how much they loved their local nonprofits, respected their leaders, and wanted them to grow stronger. Recognizing that strong, local organizations with equally strong leaders are vital to creating and maintaining strong communities, the T. Rowe Price Foundation launched its Capacity Building Program, offering training in key areas local leaders had identified as the most important to them.In 2022, the T. Rowe Price Foundation has engaged over 5,000 organizational leaders in Baltimore through the Foundation's Capacity Building Program. The program offers tailored trainings, focused cohorts, educational webinars, and organizational health assessments. The latter section, organizational health assessments, yielded tens of thousands of data points on the organizational health of many Baltimore nonprofit partners that formed the basis for the ""State of the Baltimore Nonprofit Sector Report.""""We view the data in this report as a resource for the broader nonprofit and funder community in Baltimore and beyond. We hope that it helps our nonprofits develop strategies for future growth, enables grant-makers to develop better strategies to serve their grantees, and helps intermediaries think through stronger supports for their networks,"" said John Brothers, president of the T. Rowe Price Foundation. ""We hope that this report supports a more robust sector conversation that moves our discussions toward an emphasis on the organizational health outcomes of our nonprofit sector, rather than the current overemphasis on program outcomes, while considering factors such as racial equity and nonprofit leadership. This is one of the most comprehensive case studies on the health of a city's nonprofit sector. We hope it will provide inspiration for others to investigate the health of the nonprofit sectors in their own cities, states, and regions.""Supporting partners for the ""State of the Baltimore Nonprofit Sector Report"" include SeaChange Capital Partners, Algorhythm, the Building Movement Project, and the Meyer Foundation.About the T.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global and U.S. logistics industries and proceed to the top logistics companies in USA, you can go directly to Top 5 Logistics Companies in USA.The Logistics Industry: An AnalysisThe global logistics industry is responsible for the movement of goods around the world. It is a vital part of the global economy, and its success is dependent on the efficient and reliable transportation of goods. The industry has been growing in recent years, due to the increase in global trade. This has led to a demand for more efficient and reliable logistics services. The industry is expected to continue to grow in the future, as the global economy expands.The logistics industry is made up of a number of different players, from the giant multinational corporations that own the ships and planes, to the smaller companies that move goods around on the ground. In between these two extremes are the freight forwarders, who act as the middlemen, coordinating the movement of goods and ensuring that they arrive at their destination on time.According to an industry analysis report by a top-rated American market research company, Expert Market Research, the global logistics industry was valued at $9.5 trillion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% through 2027, attaining a value of $13.3 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.There are a number of trends that are impacting the global logistics industry. One of the most notable is the rise of e-commerce and the corresponding increase in demand for last-mile delivery services. This has led to a number of new players entering the market, as well as a number of traditional logistics providers expanding their operations to include last-mile delivery services. Another trend that is having an impact on the logistics industry is the increasing focus on sustainability. This is leading to a number of initiatives aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of the logistics sector. For example, many logistics providers are pouring hefty investments into electric vehicles and green technologies. Furthermore, the technological advancements in disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, and Big Data are further fueling the growth and revolutionizing the logistics industry.Story continuesAccording to a market analysis report by Grand View Research, the U.S. retail logistics market attained a value of $43 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.0% through 2030 and reach a value of $109.3 billion by the end of the forecasted period. The conventional retail logistics segment held the upper hand over the e-commerce retail logistics segment and held a 57.3% market share of the U.S. logistics market in 2021.

Despite the strong results over the past few quarters, the stock peaked back in November of 2021 as investors have begun trying to time the end of the economic cycle, using Landstar as a proxy for economic activity. We are less concerned about where we are in this particular macroeconomic cycle, not only because the market has already discounted a slowdown but also because the underinvestment in long-haul drivers has been a multi-decade phenomenon that will not likely be solved even if consumer demand normalizes over the next few quarters. We think Landstar should generate excess returns over time because it has been one of the few companies that has been steadily investing in drivers while there has not been a concomitant increase in competitive capacity.”7.

First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company’s leading stakeholders in Q2.Ariel Investments mentioned The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Bank Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Largest Gas Station Chains in the US15 Biggest Global Construction Companies10 Most Successful Penny Stocks EverDisclosure.

See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to reported gross profit under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).4Adjusted earnings from operations excludes an increase in cost of revenues from the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting, acquisition and integration expenses and the nonrecurring gain on divestiture of the Company’s Colorado and Texas ready-mixed concrete operations on April 1, 2022, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to reported earnings from operations under GAAP.5Earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, excludes the earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates, acquisition and integration expenses, an increase in cost of revenues from the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting and the nonrecurring gain on divestiture of the Company’s Colorado and Texas ready-mixed concrete operations on April 1, 2022, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta.6Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations excludes an increase in cost of revenues from the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting, acquisition and integration expenses, and the nonrecurring gain on divestiture of the Company's Colorado and Texas ready-mixed concrete operations on April 1, 2022, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to reported earnings per diluted share under GAAP.Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated, “Our third-quarter results highlight our commitment to execution of our value-over-volume strategy as double-digit pricing growth drove record profitability despite relatively flat organic aggregates shipments. Importantly, we expect a return to expanding margins in the fourth quarter as the compounding effect of multiple pricing actions throughout the year offsets continued inflationary pressure and a slowdown in single-family residential construction.Story continues“Martin Marietta’s strategic coast-to-coast footprint is well-positioned for long-term growth, driven by favorable population migration trends, housing shortages in our markets and a long-term federal highway bill complemented by healthy Department of Transportation (DOT) budgets in the Company's key states. Near-term, we expect affordability driven headwinds in the single-family residential end market will be offset by a significant acceleration in public infrastructure investment and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects.Mr. Nye concluded, “While the Company’s 2022 year-to-date safety performance continues to be at world-class levels as measured by both Total Injury and Lost Time Incidence Rates, our work in this vital dimension is never done. Our commitment to continuous improvement in employee health and well-being, world-class safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and execution of our strategic plan reinforces our confidence in Martin Marietta’s ability to provide compelling results for the foreseeable future. Moreover, Martin Marietta’s track record of success throughout various business cycles proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates-led business model, chosen geographies, and our ability to adapt to the challenges inherent in a dynamic macroeconomic environment. Importantly, we expect that the carryover effects of our 2022 pricing momentum, coupled with our broad-based January 1, 2023 announced price increases, will drive accelerated aggregates unit margin expansion next year.”Third-Quarter Financial and Operating Results(All financial and operating results are for continuing operations and comparisons are versus the prior-year third quarter, unless otherwise noted)Building Materials BusinessBuilding Materials generated record products and services revenues of $1.61 billion for the third quarter, a 15.9 percent increase, driven primarily by acquisitions and double-digit pricing growth across all product lines. Products and services gross profit increased 13.1 percent, or 10.9 percent on an adjusted basis, to a record $467.2 million. Elevated energy, internal freight, contract services as well as repairs and maintenance costs contributed to a products and services gross margin decline of 70 basis points, or 130 basis points on an adjusted basis, to 29.0 percent.Aggregates  Third-quarter organic aggregates shipments were flat, largely due to logistical constraints, cement shortages and inclement weather in certain key markets. Importantly, organic pricing increased 11.9 percent, or 11.3 percent on a mix-adjusted basis, due to the cumulative effect of price increases throughout the year. Including acquired operations, total aggregates shipments and pricing increased 5.6 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively.By segment:East Group total shipments were flat, as solid underlying demand was negatively impacted by supply chain challenges as well as weather-related disruptions. Pricing increased 11.5 percent, or 10.3 percent on a mix-adjusted basis.West Group total shipments improved 15.6 percent, driven primarily by contributions from acquired operations as well as strong Texas demand, partially offset by a historically wet August in North Texas. Organic pricing increased 12.4 percent, or 13.2 percent on a mix-adjusted basis.Third-quarter aggregates product gross profit improved 12.8 percent, or 10.5 percent on an adjusted basis, to a record $330.3 million, while product gross margin declined 170 basis points, or 240 basis points on an adjusted basis, to 32.5 percent, primarily due to increased energy, internal freight and repairs and maintenance costs.CementCement shipments increased 2.3 percent to 1.1 million tons, a third-quarter record. Additionally, pricing increased 21.4 percent, or 20.6 percent on a mix-adjusted basis, driven by continued strong demand and the impact of multiple price increases during the year. Cement product gross profit grew to a record $67.7 million, an increase of 35.7 percent, while product gross margins expanded 380 basis points to 41.5 percent, as pricing gains more than offset higher energy costs in the period.Downstream businessesOn an organic basis, ready mixed concrete shipments were down 16.8 percent primarily due to record rainfall in portions of Texas during August as well as the completion of certain large projects. However, pricing increased 20.3 percent due to the positive impact of multiple price increases implemented during the year.Ready mixed concrete product revenues and gross profit from continuing operations declined 29.1 percent and 40.3 percent, respectively, driven largely by the April 1 divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas ready mixed concrete businesses, which was partially offset by contributions from acquired ready mixed concrete operations in Arizona. Increased raw materials costs weighed on gross margin.On an organic basis, total asphalt shipments and pricing increased 4.3 percent and 22.0 percent, respectively. Notably, prior year volumes were constrained by the shortage in liquid asphalt, or bitumen.Including contributions from the acquired West Coast operations, total asphalt shipments and pricing increased 31.3 percent and 26.1 percent, respectively. Total asphalt and paving product gross profit increased to a record $50.5 million. However, continued acceleration of liquid asphalt costs contributed to the gross margin compression of 360 basis points, or 470 basis points on an adjusted basis, in the third quarter.Magnesia Specialties BusinessMagnesia Specialties product revenues decreased 4.0 percent to $69.0 million, driven largely by lower demand from domestic steel industry customers for dolomitic lime products. Product gross profit declined 22.9 percent to $21.6 million as higher energy costs, particularly natural gas, depressed gross margin in the quarter.ConsolidatedOther operating income, net, of $14.8 million includes $14.5 million in nonrecurring gains from the sales of surplus land and other assets.On August 9, 2022, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell the Tehachapi, California cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland Company for $350 million in cash. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.Cash Generation, Capital Allocation and LiquidityCash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $560.7 million compared with $780.3 million for the prior-year period.Cash paid for property, plant and equipment additions for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $309.1 million. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to range from $450 million to $500 million.During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company returned $268.1 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. As of September 30, 2022, 13.1 million shares remained under the current repurchase authorization.The Company had $135.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and nearly $1.20 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities as of September 30, 2022.On September 29, 2022, the Company utilized existing cash resources to satisfy and discharge its $700.0 million 0.650% Senior Notes due 2023.

See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta.3Organic volume % growth range is for organic aggregates shipments, inclusive of internal tons, and is in comparison with 2021 organic shipments of 192.9 million tons.4 Total volume % growth range is for total aggregates shipments, inclusive of internal tons and acquired operations, and is in comparison with total 2021 shipments of 201.2 million tons.5 Organic ASP % growth range is for organic aggregates average selling price and is in comparison with 2021 organic ASP of $15.21 per ton.6Total ASP growth is for total aggregates average selling price, inclusive of acquired operations, and is in comparison with 2021 total ASP of $15.08 per ton.Preliminary View of 2023The Company’s preliminary view of 2023 anticipates aggregates shipments to be effectively flat as the Company expects stronger demand from public infrastructure and heavy nonresidential projects of scale to be offset by single-family residential softening. We anticipate aggregates pricing to increase by a low-double-digit percentage in 2023 as the carryover effects from multiple actions taken in 2022 are compounded with additional price increases beginning in January of next year.Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis earnings release contains financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP measures are included in the Appendix to this earnings release. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are commonly used financial measures for investors to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and, when read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements, present a useful tool to evaluate the Company’s ongoing operations, performance from period to period and anticipated performance. In addition, these are some of the factors the Company uses in internal evaluations of the overall performance of its businesses. Management acknowledges that there are many items that impact a company’s reported results and the adjustments reflected in these non-GAAP measures are not intended to present all items that may have impacted these results. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.Conference Call InformationThe Company will discuss its third-quarter 2022 earnings results on a conference call and an online webcast today (November 2, 2022).

continued increases in the cost of other repair and supply parts; construction labor shortages and/or supply‐chain challenges; unexpected equipment failures, unscheduled maintenance, industrial accident or other prolonged and/or significant disruption to production facilities; the resiliency and potential declines of the Company’s various construction end-use markets; the potential negative duration, severity and impact of a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s ability to continue supplying heavy-side building materials and related services at normal levels or at all in the Company’s key regions, including the markets in which it does business, its suppliers, customers or other business partners as well as on its employees; the economic impact of government responses to a resurgence of COVID-19; the performance of the United States economy; the impact of governmental orders restricting activities imposed to prevent further outbreak of COVID-19 on travel, potentially reducing state fuel tax revenues used to fund highway projects; a decline in the commercial component of the nonresidential construction market, notably office and retail space, including a decline resulting from economic distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic; increasing governmental regulation, including environmental laws; the failure of relevant government agencies to implement expected regulatory reductions; transportation availability or a sustained reduction in capital investment by the railroads, notably the availability of railcars, locomotive power and the condition of rail infrastructure to move trains to supply the Company’s Texas, Colorado, Florida, Carolinas and Gulf Coast markets, including the movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan and its customers; increased transportation costs, including increases from higher or fluctuating passed-through energy costs or fuel surcharges, and other costs to comply with tightening regulations, as well as higher volumes of rail and water shipments; availability of trucks and licensed drivers for transport of the Company’s materials; availability and cost of construction equipment in the United States; weakening in the steel industry markets served by the Company’s dolomitic lime products; trade disputes with one or more nations impacting the U.S. economy, including the impact of tariffs on the steel industry; unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers that introduce volatility to earnings, including that of the Magnesia Specialties business that is running at capacity; proper functioning of information technology and automated operating systems to manage or support operations; inflation and its effect on both production and interest costs; the concentration of customers in construction markets and the increased risk of potential losses on customer receivables; the impact of the level of demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and management of production costs on the operating leverage and therefore profitability of the Company; the possibility that the expected synergies from acquisitions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, including achieving anticipated profitability to maintain compliance with the Company’s leverage ratio debt covenant; changes in tax laws, the interpretation of such laws and/or administrative practices, including acquisitions or divestitures, that would increase the Company’s tax rate; violation of the Company’s debt covenant if price and/or volumes return to previous levels of instability; downward pressure on the Company’s common stock price and its impact on goodwill impairment evaluations; the possibility of a reduction of the Company’s credit rating to non-investment grade; and other risk factors listed from time to time found in the Company’s filings with the SEC.

restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives; quality remediation; acquisition, integration, divestiture and related; certain legal and tax matters; and discontinued operations.  We have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts.  For example, the timing of certain transactions is difficult to predict because management's plans may change.  In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors.  It is probable that these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding financial guidance, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including any continued recovery, and any statements about our forecasts, expectations, plans, intentions, strategies or prospects.

Meanwhile, the Surface Technologies unit’s profit came in at $40.8 million, underperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.36 million.For the quarter ended Sep 30, this seabed-to-surface oilfield equipment and services provider’s revenues of $1.73 billion marginally underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 billion, primarily due to lower-than-expected revenues from the Surface Technologies segment. However, revenues increased from the year-ago quarter’s $1.58 billion. This could be attributed to better-than-anticipated revenues of the Subsea unit.Giving some respite to investors, FTI’s third-quarter inbound orders increased by 35.4% from the year-ago period’s level to $1.85 billion, reflecting strong revenue visibility.Also, the company’s backlog rose. As of September end, TechnipFMC’s order backlog stood at $8.84 billion, improving by about 26.3% from the 2021 reading.TechnipFMC plc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTechnipFMC plc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTechnipFMC plc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | TechnipFMC plc QuoteSegment AnalysisSubsea:  Revenues in the quarter under review were $1.41 billion, up 1.46% from the year-ago sales figure of $1.31 billion due to higher project installation activity in Brazil and Guyana.Adjusted EBITDA was reported at $183.8 million, up by about 25.5% from the year-ago quarter’s level due to improved margins in the backlog and increased installation activity. The quarterly inbound orders jumped 25.5% to $1.4 billion, while the backlog rose 14.1%.Surface Technologies:  This smaller segment of the company recorded revenues of $318 million, up 19% year over year due to revenue growth globally, with particular strength in the Middle East.Story continuesMoreover, the unit’s adjusted EBITDA increased by 43.7% to $40.8 million due to higher international activity, including the progressive ramp-up in the Middle East volume and the timing of associated costs.The segment’s inbound orders rose significantly by about 79.8%, while the quarter-end backlog increased by 263%.FinancialsIn the reported quarter, TechnipFMC spent $30.9 million on capital programs.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) so let's look a bit deeper.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Mondelez International:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.094 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$66b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, Mondelez International has an ROCE of 9.4%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Food industry average of 9.5%. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International roceIn the above chart we have measured Mondelez International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Mondelez International.What Does the ROCE Trend For Mondelez International Tell Us?Mondelez International is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 27% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Mondelez International's ROCETo bring it all together, Mondelez International has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with a respectable 68% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.If you want to continue researching Mondelez International, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Mondelez International may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Sales were $7.76 billion, up 8.1% from a year ago. CEO Dirk Van de Put wrote in the earnings release, “Our third-quarter performance demonstrates the resilience of our snacking categories, strength of our brands, broad-based net revenue growth of both our emerging and developed markets, effective execution of pricing, and solid volume growth, enabling us to raise our full-year revenue and earnings outlook.”Electronic Arts (EA): The company cut its full-year net bookings finance to $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion, down from its initial forecast of $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion.

This compares to earnings of $0.71 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.82%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.67, delivering a surprise of 4.69%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Mondelez , which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $7.76 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.80%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.18 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Mondelez shares have lost about 7.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Mondelez?While Mondelez has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Mondelez: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.70 on $8.05 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.88 on $30.56 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

A lot of it has to do with the earnings that we've gotten over the last half an hour or so. So we have Airbnb, AMD, Mondelez, EA, and Match Group. Let's kick it off with Airbnb. Again, the stock off just around 4% after-hours. A lot of that movement has to do with the guidance that we just got from the company. They say that they expect fourth quarter nights and experiences booked, that growth to moderate slightly.This month, we saw 25% growth in that division there. They also expect average daily rates to moderate. They also pointed to some headwinds, but it has to do with the strong dollar. Taking a look, though, at the current quarter, at the most recent quarter's results, most profitable quarter on record here for the company. Revenue also beating the Street's expectations. Yet, that guidance is really what's weighing on shares, off just about 4%. Over the past three months, the stock has been essentially flat, down nearly 2%. Year to date, though, a bit of a different story. You can see the losses there with shares off about 35%.Let's take a look at. AMD that stock moving here after-hours, up just about 2%. Some of that bad news had already been baked in. We got prelim results from AMD about four weeks ago. And if you take a look at the two-month chart, you can really see the drop in the stock shortly after they were announced. And we've traded pretty flat ever since then.And so here we are today. We closed up 59.66. In terms of the numbers that we got, revenue, $5.6 billion. Adjusted EPS, $0.67. That was actually better than what the Street was looking for. But fourth quarter revenue guidance coming in a bit light, $5.2 billion to $5.8 billion. We just talked to Angelo Zino. He's a CFRA, and he was saying that it was actually better than feared. So even though it missed Wall Street expectations, many on the Street were bracing for worse. So that explains the 2% move to the upside that we're seeing after-hours.Story continuesLet's take a look at Mondelez International, moving to the upside and jumping just around 3 and 1/2%. So off the highs that we just saw a couple of minutes ago. Moving to the upside after raising its organic growth outlook. For the quarter, revenue of 7.76 billion. That was better than what the Street was looking for. EPS of $0.74. North America revenue, 19.6%. Taking a look at the two-month chart, the stock has been essentially flat over the past three months, off just around nearly 5%, 61.87 a share.EA, Electronic Arts, out with results here and some of their guidance coming in a bit light. That's why we're seeing the stock off just around 1.4%. Net booking guidance for the full year missing the Street's expectations for the fiscal second quarter. That's the numbers that we just got. Net bookings, 1.75 billion-- slightly light there. Adjusted EPS beating, though, at $1.45. Revenue, $1.9 billion.And wrapping up with Match, you can see that stock popping after-hours. They were up just around 10% now, up nearly 13%. Revenue, $809.5 million. That was better than what the Street was looking for. EPS a bit light, $0.44. But it looks like the Street's really focusing on that revenue beat. We're seeing shares move to the upside. Over the past three months, stock off just about 40%.]"
424,4092c0c5-ad0b-3d4f-ba19-bed503208846,OXY,2022-11-02,Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-oxy-earnings-expected-140102133.html,1667311262,STORY,['OXY'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 8. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas exploration and production company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +185.1%.Revenues are expected to be $9.35 billion, up 37.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 20.14% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Occidental?For Occidental, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.77%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Occidental will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Occidental would post earnings of $2.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.16, delivering a surprise of +7.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Occidental doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, Cactus, Inc. (WHD) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.49 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +157.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $182.98 million, up 58.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Cactus, Inc. has been revised 2.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.74%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Cactus, Inc. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Equitrans Midstream shares have lost about 18.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Equitrans Midstream?While Equitrans Midstream has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Equitrans Midstream: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.16 on $379.94 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.54 on $1.4 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States is currently in the top 19% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Occidental Petroleum (OXY), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 8.This oil and gas exploration and production company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +185.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 20.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Occidental Petroleum's revenues are expected to be $9.35 billion, up 37.3% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

435,8b612c55-bc77-3e62-b988-fff4fad443e5,KO,2022-11-02,The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 61% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-120034702.html,1667390434,STORY,['KO'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Coca-Cola. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Coca-Cola does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Coca-Cola, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Coca-Cola. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.9% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Coca-Cola Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.7b of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Coca-Cola. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 9.2% of the Coca-Cola shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.Recent times have been advantageous for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this strong earnings performance might be about to tail off. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Coca-Cola Europacific Partners.How Is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners would need to produce growth that's similar to the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 127% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 47% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 4.3% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 6.5% growth per year, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.With this information, we find it interesting that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' P/E?We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Our examination of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Plus, you should also learn about these   2 warning signs we've spotted with Coca-Cola Europacific Partners.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

You can skip our detailed analysis of safe stocks, and go directly to read 5 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Recent selloffs have devastated several equities, and investors are still divided on whether the market has reached oversold territory. Some predict a recession and blame it on the Federal Reserve's (Fed) upcoming interest rate increases, while others blame the gigantic valuations of major tech companies. Whatever it may be, the stock market is presently quite volatile. Uncertainty levels are at an all-time high as the Fed fights against inflation and a weakening economy. The Fed cannot deploy quantitative easing to boost the economy, unlike in 2008 and 2020. Inflation will only get worse if this is done.However, just because there is uncertainty in the stock market doesn't mean investors should stay out. Contrarily, historically speaking, bear markets have been a great investment opportunity. Additionally, investors have choices on how to put their money to work. Buy safe investments to weather the short-term storm and steadily increase your wealth over time if you don't have the stomach for more volatility or danger.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:We turn to the smart money to see how they are playing the current turmoil. For this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 895 hedge funds and picked some of the safest stocks these funds were piling into as of the end of June. These are safe, blue-chip companies. Some of them have long-term growth potential while others pay consistent dividend income without any uncertainty. Some of the notable names in the list include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), among others.Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 55Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) specializes in producing and distributing healthcare, household, and personal care products. On October 17, Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers lowered his price target on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to $85 from $87 but kept a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst anticipates Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to release a ""solid set"" of third-quarter financial results, with persistent pressure on gross margins offset by robust organic growth evenly distributed across all regional divisions including its per food segment Hill's.Story continuesThe company was a popular stock among elite funds in Q2 2022, as 55 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the stock, up from 50 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of nearly $3 billion.According to CNBC, Third Point's Loeb sees unrecognized value in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) Hill business. Here is what Third Point specifically said about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 60The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage manufacturer with a brand portfolio of 200 brands of soft drinks, coffee, teas, and water across more than 200 countries and regions. Berkshire Hathaway’s holding of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) remained unchanged during the second quarter of 2022, and the fund had an investment value of approximately $25 billion in the company at the end of Q2 2022. The fund is the leading shareholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) out of the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey during Q2.Given the relatively stable demand for its products, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shares are up 0.39% year to date and the company remains very profitable despite the economic headwinds. It released its latest quarter results on October 25, reporting an EPS of $0.69, beating estimates by $0.05, and revenue of $11.10 billion, beating the estimates by $602.57 million.On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom raised his price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $68 from $63 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst's research note to investors, the company's Q3 earnings performance was ""impressive"" since organic growth more than offset further currency challenges. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) risk/reward ratio appears positive, says Grom, given that its shares have recently underperformed and there is a possibility for better revenue growth to support a prolonged premium compared to its competitors.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion.Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”09. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 61Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American manufacturer of healthcare products worldwide. It operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. On September 15, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a $0.47 per share quarterly dividend, which is payable on November 15 to shareholders of record on October 14.

Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”08.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +5.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +8.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has gained 9.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.53 indicates a change of +2.1% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $42.73 billion and $43.51 billion estimates indicate +10.6% and +1.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $0.69 for the same period compares with $0.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.37%. The EPS surprise was +7.81%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the company’s lead drug, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), continues to witness growth in patient demand.The company reported adjusted earnings of 60 cents per share in the third quarter of 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. It had reported earnings of $1.18 per share in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues came in at $823.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, increasing 1.2% year over year.

Jakafi’s (a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor approved for polycythemiavera, myelofibrosis and refractory acute graft-versus-host disease) revenues came in at $619.5 million. The figure increased 13% from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $616 million.Net product revenues of Iclusig amounted to $25.9 million, down 9% from the year-ago quarter.Pemazyre generated $23.4 million in sales during the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 33% year over year.The newly approved medicine, Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream generated $38.1 million in sales during the third quarter.In July 2022, the FDA approved Opzelura cream 1.5% for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Opzelura is also approved by the FDA for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.Per the company, growth in Opzelura revenues during the third quarter of 2022 was largely driven by strong demand for both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.Jakavi’s (name outside the United States) royalty revenues from Novartis NVS for commercialization in ex-U.S. markets declined 9% to $85.8 million.Story continuesJakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country.Incyte also receives royalties from sales of Tabrecta (capmatinib) for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Its partner, Novartis, has exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights for Tabrecta.Tabrecta’s product royalty revenues came in at $4.1 million, up 50% year over year.Olumiant’s (baricitinib) product royalty revenues from Eli Lilly LLY came in at $20.3 million, down 76% year over year.Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly for Olumiant. The drug is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to LLY and is approved for several types of autoimmune diseases.R&amp;D expenses were $358.3 million, up 16% from the year-ago quarter, owing to higher investments in late-stage pipeline development. SG&amp;A expenses amounted to $247.5 million, up 47% from the prior-year quarter, due to the expenses related to the establishment of its dermatology commercial organization and activities to support the potential launch of Opzelura for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and pre-launch activities for the vitiligo indication.Pipeline and Regulatory UpdatesLast month, Incyte entered into an agreement to acquire Villaris Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel antibody therapeutics for vitiligo. Its lead asset, auremolimab (VM6), an anti-IL-15Rβ monoclonal antibody (mAb), is expected to enter clinical development in 2023.In August 2022, the FDA approved Pemazyre (pemigatinib), a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with FGFR1 rearrangement. MLNs with FGFR1 rearrangement are extremely rare and aggressive blood cancers that may affect less than 1 in 100,000 people in the United States.Pemazyre is already approved for adults with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangements.2022 GuidanceIncyte tightened the full-year Jakafi net product revenue guidance. The company now expects Jakafi revenues to be in the range of $2.38-$2.40 billion compared with the previous expectation of $2.36-$2.40 billion for 2022.Other Hematology/Oncology net product revenues are now projected in the range of $200-$210 million compared with the previous expectation of $210-$240 million.Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIncyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIncyte Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Incyte Corporation QuoteZacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NASDAQ:INTU) Trading At A 24% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-inc-nasdaq-intu-trading-120047674.html,1667390447,STORY,['INTU'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Intuit The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.13bUS$5.04bUS$5.83bUS$6.75bUS$7.71bUS$8.42bUS$9.01bUS$9.50bUS$9.93bUS$10.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 9.18%Est @ 7.02%Est @ 5.51%Est @ 4.45%Est @ 3.71% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$3.9kUS$4.4kUS$4.7kUS$5.1kUS$5.4kUS$5.5kUS$5.5kUS$5.4kUS$5.2kUS$5.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$50bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$196bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$196b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$96bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$146b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$395, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuit as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.046. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation.

Table 1 reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:Share-based compensation expenseAmortization of acquired technologyAmortization of other acquired intangible assetsGoodwill and intangible asset impairment chargesGains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assetsProfessional fees and transaction costs for business combinationsWe also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:Gains and losses on debt and equity securities and other investmentsIncome tax effects and adjustmentsDiscontinued operationsWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit’s operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments, or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.Share-based compensation expenses. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire a business in a business combination, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the business and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired businesses. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete, and trade names.Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.Gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets because they are unrelated to our ongoing business operating results.Professional fees and transaction costs for business combinations. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal, and accounting fees.Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and gains and losses on other investments.Income tax effects and adjustments. We use a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating results and for planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate excludes the income tax effects of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our current long-term projections, we are using a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for various reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. We will evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis and whenever any significant events occur which may materially affect this rate.Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table 1 include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments, and disposals of business and long-lived assets.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221101006269/en/ContactsInvestors Kim WatkinsIntuit Inc.650-944-3324kim_watkins@intuit.comMedia Abby SmithIntuit Inc.408-839-6028abby_smith@intuit.com]"

Departing workers will continue to be replaced, and there will be no pay cuts, she wrote.“Our partners worry about lending products among high inflation, potential for rising unemployment and the possibility of recession, which results in fewer opportunities for us to provide products for a broader range of members,” according to the letter.Many tech companies and startups have paused hiring or cut jobs this year amid a tough economic environment. After the Credit Karma hiring freeze email went out, employees and prospective new hires turned to the anonymous online forum Blind to discuss whether pending job interviews and offers would be kept. In her email, McCreary said that 500 new segment employees have joined in the past five quarters, and there are about 100 people that have either been given an offer, or accepted one and haven’t started yet.Intuit shares fell as much as 9.5% Tuesday in New York, the biggest intraday decline in almost six months. The stock had dropped 34% this year through Monday’s close.The reaction is “likely reminding investors that it is tough to find ‘safe places’ in a broad downturn,” wrote Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow. It may also signal investor fear in additional Intuit weakness beyond Credit Karma, wrote BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Jester.Story continues“Like most companies, Credit Karma is keeping a close eye on the current economic conditions and we have gotten more conservative with our hiring,” a Credit Karma spokesperson said. “We are still hiring for some open roles but this move allows us optionality as a business.”Credit Karma, which provides credit scores and connects users to loans, was acquired by Intuit for $7.1 billion in February 2020. It has been among the fastest-growing segments in Intuit’s portfolio, with sales expanding as much as 48% in 2022’s third fiscal quarter. However, the company sees a slowdown to 10% to 15% growth in fiscal year 2023.Intuit is set to report earnings at the end of the month, and has projected revenue growth of about 24%. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Niraj Patel wrote that worsening small business sentiment and tight consumer budgets could make it hard to meet this guidance.(Updates with comments from analysts in the sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEl Salvador’s $300 Million Bitcoin ‘Revolution’ Is Failing MiserablyUS Housing Hit by Spiraling Mortgage Rates as Inflation PersistsYeezy Roller Coaster Ended With Two-Minute Phone Call at AdidasFast Fashion Waste Is Choking Developing Countries With Mountains of TrashThese Five Women Are Helping Doctors Crack the Long-Covid Mystery©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The bottom line declined 3.6% year over year.GAAP EPS in the quarter was $2.14, up 87.7% from the prior-year quarter.Revenue DetailsThis Michigan-based medical device company reported revenues of $4.48 billion, which slightly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.47 billion. The top line improved 7.7% on a year-over-year basis and 11.4% at constant currency (cc). Sales were up 9.9% organically, reflecting 10.6% growth in unit volume, which was offset by 0.7% due to lower prices.Revenues by GeographyRevenues in the United States were $3.36 billion, up 11.3% year over year. However, International sales were down 1.9% to $1.12 billion. Strong growth in Europe, Canada and emerging markets were more than offset by lower sales in China. Excluding the negative impact of currency, International sales were up 11.7%.Segmental AnalysisEffective Dec 31, 2021, Stryker updated its reportable business segments to align with its new internal reporting structure.MedSurg and Neurotechnology: This segment reported sales of $2.59 billion, up 10.2% year over year and 13.5% at cc. Double-digit growth in the core Endoscopy, Sports Medicine, Sage and acute care businesses primarily drove segmental sales. Per management, the segment saw 10.8% organic growth in the reported quarter.Orthopedics and Spine: Sales in the segment amounted to $1.94 billion, up 4.4% year over year and 8.7% at cc. The upside can be attributed to strength in the Hip, Knee, and Trauma and Extremities businesses sub-segments.MarginsIn the third quarter, adjusted gross profit totaled $2.8 billion, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter. The adjusted gross margin was 62.6%, down 370 basis points (bps).Total operating expenses were $1.97 billion, down 4.5% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower selling, general &amp; administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses.Story continuesStryker Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseStryker Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseStryker Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Stryker Corporation QuoteAdjusted operating income amounted to $1 billion, down 5.4% from the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, down 310 bps.Financial UpdateThe company exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.42 billion, compared with $1.04 billion in the preceding quarter.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter was $1.62 billion, compared with $2.26 billion in the year-ago period.2022 ViewStryker raised the lower end of its guidance for revenue growth in 2022, considering its strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in the implant businesses. The company expects net sales to grow in the range of 8.5% to 9%, compared with the previous expectation of 8% to 9%. The company expects unfavorable currency movement to hurt growth by approximately 4%, if foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels.Unfavorable currency movement, ongoing supply chain challenges and the inflationary environment led Stryker to lower its adjusted net earnings per share guidance to the range of $9.15 to $9.25 from the previous band of $9.30 to $9.50.Wrapping UpStryker exited third-quarter 2022 on a mixed note, wherein earnings missed the consensus estimate while revenues surpassed the same. The company witnessed strong performance across the segments in the United States. However, International sales declined due to unfavorable currency movement.Per management, the company continues to face material shortages, which primarily affected Medical and Instruments sales during the third quarter. Moreover, ongoing negative foreign currency values and inflationary pressure continue to hurt margins, a trend expected to continue in the fourth quarter also but at a lower rate. Stryker is taking action to lessen the negative price impact. It is also taking several cost-cutting initiatives, including restructuring plans. The 9.2% year-over-year decline in SG&amp;A expenses during the third quarter is likely due to these actions, implying that margins may improve going forward. Stryker’s prospects in 2023 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products as well as new launches.However, the contraction in both gross and operating margins is disappointing. Stryker continues to grapple with pricing pressure. Stiff competition in the MedTech space remains a concern.Zacks RankStryker currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Elevance Health, Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now. The global infrastructure construction market was worth $2,242.3 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $3,267.3 billion by 2027, indicating a growth rate of 6.48% during the forecast period. Infrastructure earnings are resilient and it is a low-beta sector, but the space is not suited to outperform during a cyclical economic recovery. New York Life Investments believes that infrastructure earnings will potentially outperform global earnings for the first time in multiple years in 2022. The broader equity market earnings are set to decelerate while the infrastructure industry delivers robust growth. The firm anticipates 10% earnings growth compared to the broader equity market growth of only 7%. Historically, moderating economic growth has been a positive sign for infrastructure. During such economic cycles, infrastructure has reported an average annualized return of about 18.5%, topping global equities by 5%. Moreover, during times of above-average inflation, infrastructure has surpassed global equities by 7% to 9% in terms of annualized returns. With this macroeconomic outlook in mind, New York Life Investments backed 2022 to be a good year for the infrastructure space. Some of the best infrastructure stocks to invest in, to benefit from the acceleration in the sector, include Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH). Our Methodology We selected the firms which are involved directly or indirectly in key infrastructure sectors such as roads, railways, electricity and power, water and sewerage, communication, and airports. Positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and robust dividend profiles were classifiers for choosing the following infrastructure stocks. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continues10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Denys Nevozhai on UnsplashBest Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now10. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) owns and operates utilities, transport, midstream, and data businesses in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. The company operates electricity transmission and distribution lines, natural gas pipelines, and operational telecom towers. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) is one of the leading global managers of infrastructure assets that drive cash flow. On September 23, TD Securities analyst Cherilyn Radbourne assumed coverage of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) with a Buy rating and a $49 price target. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) has achieved 10% organic growth year-to-date, which the analyst observed is ahead of its 6%-9% target range, and she believes the company is on track to repeat this performance in 2023 and ""possibly also"" in 2024, since about 70% of its cash flows are linked to inflation.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 18 hedge funds were long Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) at the end of June 2022, compared to 15 funds in the last quarter. Select Equity Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 418,087 shares worth nearly $16 million.In addition to Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.

Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK) is a Wisconsin-based manufacturer of specialty vehicles worldwide. The company also provides aerial work platforms and telehandlers for use in various construction, industrial, institutional, and general maintenance applications. On October 27, Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on November 28, to shareholders of record on November 14. The dividend yield on November 1 came in at 1.68%. On October 28, JPMorgan analyst Tami Zakaria raised the price target on Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK) to $85 from $82 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares after the Q3 results. The debate around margin recovery next year remains unresolved for now, the analyst told investors in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 22 funds reported owning stakes worth $136 million in Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK), compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter worth $130.7 million. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management held the leading position in the company, comprising 479,496 shares valued at $38.6 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Value Equity has to say about Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Oshkosh is typically a North American market share leader in its respective equipment types and supplies a wide swath of industries and end customers. For instance, it is the global leader in aerial work platforms through its JLG brand. It is also the largest light defense truck supplier to the U.S military, with its Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) chosen to replace the Humvee in 2015.We had previously owned Oshkosh in our Value Equity portfolios for the better part of a decade. As long-time admirers of the company’s quality characteristics, and through our diligent process continuing to closely follow as management creates ways to improve, we have once again found an opportunity to be investors.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Oshkosh include:-Pricing power stemming from its leading market share positions in nearly every business segment, vital nature of its products and industry concentration;-Diversified product line and customer base, as well as high barriers to entry in many of its businesses, such as fire trucks, aircraft rescue vehicles and defense; and-Consistent positive FREE cash flow generation, even during the 2008 financial crisis when most of its segments faced the steepest downturn in a generation.Attractive ValuationThrough market share gains, we expect operating margins and FREE cash flow to be higher on a normalized basis. Thus, we believe Oshkosh shares are offered at a discount to our estimates of the company’s intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Oshkosh, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Further innovation and technological improvements, particularly in the electrification of its vehicles, which could drive additional demand;-Continued rollout of its recently awarded U.S. Postal Service vehicle contract and market share gains for its JLG aerial work platforms;-Increased international orders for its JLTV military trucks as countries around the world replace aging Humvee fleets. In addition, further development of its aftermarket business can help improve profitability; and-Strong balance sheet can give management the ability to run a balanced capital allocation strategy that advances organic growth and returns cash to shareholders.”8. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) is a Canadian energy infrastructure company, operating through Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage, Renewable Power Generation, and Energy Services segments. On September 29, Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) disclosed the acquisition of U.S. renewable project developer Tri Global Energy for $270 million in cash and assumed debt. This acquisition will advance Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB)’s renewables business, while strengthening its North American growth strategy. It is one of the premier infrastructure stocks to invest in. Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kad on October 19 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) but trimmed the price target on the stock to C$64 from C$67. The analyst said that he expects fewer material earnings beats in the Midstream sector compared to Q2, but ""nonetheless largely in-line results"". Potential buyback acceleration could be a positive catalyst for some firms, he added.According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 25 hedge funds were long Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB), compared to 24 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 51.85 million shares worth $2.2 billion. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We are meaningfully overweight energy, particularly within North American energy infrastructure. Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”7. Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) is a North Carolina-based company that provides mission-critical air, fluid, energy, specialty vehicle and medical technologies in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. Ingersoll Rand Inc.

Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) is one of the best  infrastructure stocks to buy now. On October 27, Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) announced the acquisition of Everest Group and Airmax Group for approximately $86 million in cash. These acquisitions will expand Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR)’s presence in India and France, respectively. The deals are expected to conclude in Q4 2022. Morgan Stanley analyst Joshua Pokrzywinski on October 12 reiterated an Overweight rating on Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) but slashed the price target on the shares to $53 from $55. He forecasts Q3 results to be ""largely in line"" for the multi-industry group and sees most revisions due to foreign exchange headwinds. However, Q3 results are likely to give way to volatility and ""an air pocket for orders"" in Q4, the analyst added.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were bullish on Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 31 funds in the prior quarter. Henry Ellenbogen’s Durable Capital Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 4.6 million shares worth $193.2 million. Here is what Artisan Mid Cap Fund has to say about Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Ingersoll Rand is a global market leader with a broad range of mission critical flow creation technologies (pumps, compressors, etc.) for industrial and medical applications. The company’s recent Q3 results were solid and support our belief it is making the right investments in R&amp;D and acquisitions to elevate its sustainable revenue growth rate. We have been particularly encouraged by the important role IR’s products can play in reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of manufacturing facilities. With an increasingly visible organic and acquisition-driven growth capability and further margin upside from the Gardner Denver merger, we added to our position as the market appears to be underappreciating the transformation underway at the company.”6. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is a North Carolina-based company that manufactures and sells steel and steel products. The company provides hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and galvanized sheet steel products, concrete reinforcing and merchant bars, steel tubing products, electrical conduits, ferro-alloys, and wire and wire mesh products. It serves agriculture, automotive, construction, energy and transmission, oil and gas, heavy equipment, infrastructure, and transportation industries. The management expects 2022 to be the most profitable year for earnings in Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)’s history.On October 6, Goldman Sachs analyst Emily Chieng reaffirmed a Neutral rating on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) but lowered the price target on the shares to $114 from $127. The analyst sees Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) as well positioned to gain from improving construction and infrastructure demand given its ""strong portfolio of products serving those end markets."" According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 32 hedge funds were bullish on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), up from 22 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares worth approximately $135 million. Like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is one of the top infrastructure players to consider for riding the boom in the sector. Here is what Madison Funds has to say about Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Nucor (NUE) as a relative yield example within the Materials sector. NUE is a leading manufacturer of steel and steel products. It is the largest steelmaker in the U.S. based on production volume with a vertically integrated business model. The company has a low fixed-cost position due to its use of electric arc furnaces, which are cleaner, less labor and energy-intensive than blast furnaces, and this results in low total costs per unit of steel produced. Our view is that a low cost position is an important attribute in a commodity business. NUE’s historical financial record supports this view as it has been profitable every year except for one over the past fifty years, unlike many steel producing peers. In addition, the company has a diverse product and mill portfolio that takes market share over time. We believe its scale, low fixed-cost position, consistent record of profitability and diverse mill portfolio result in a sustainable competitive advantage versus peers.Our thesis on NUE is that it should benefit from higher steel prices as the U.S. economy recovers from the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company may also be a beneficiary of on-shoring, where manufacturing returns to the United States. These two dynamics should drive growth this year, and if the United States Congress passes new infrastructure legislation, that will provide another avenue for growth longer-term.""

Sempra Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.37%, on average.Factors to NoteIn the third quarter, Sempra Energy’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures accompanied by drought conditions in most regions. Such weather patterns are likely to have boosted the electricity demand for cooling purposes among the company’s customers. This is expected to have contributed to revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, some parts of its service territories experienced severe weather conditions, along with torrential rains and flooding. These may have dampened the smooth flow of electricity to its customers, thus adversely impacting the overall revenues of the company in the third quarter of 2022.Meanwhile, new requests for transmission interconnections in Oncor are likely to have favorably impacted Sempra Energy’s third-quarter top line. Also, a positive impact of the rate revision may have added impetus to third-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.40 billion, suggesting growth of 12.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.From the cost perspective, the aforementioned severe weather conditions might have caused infrastructural damage for Sempra Energy, thus pushing up the operating expenses of the company to repair the same. This might have hurt the bottom line in the third quarter.However, increased revenues from rate updates reflecting increased invested capital, as well as higher customer consumption and customer growth, are likely to have contributed to its overall third-quarter earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.90 per share, indicating growth of 11.8% from the prior-year reported figure.Sempra Energy Price and EPS SurpriseSempra Energy Price and EPS SurpriseSempra Energy price-eps-surprise | Sempra Energy QuoteStory continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for SRE this time.

462,9201dec4-3880-32ce-a381-ad16125494c4,SRE,2022-11-02,Southwest Gas (SWX) to Report Q3 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-gas-swx-report-q3-140102526.html,1667311262,STORY,"['SWX', 'SRE']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Southwest Gas (SWX) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis natural gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.36 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +620%.Revenues are expected to be $1.09 billion, up 22.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.01% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southwest Gas?For Southwest Gas, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -15.89%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southwest Gas will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Southwest Gas would post earnings of $0.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.23, delivering a surprise of -56.60%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Southwest Gas doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerSempra (SRE), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Gas Distribution industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.90 for the quarter ended September 2022.

(NYSE:LYB) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.82bUS$3.45bUS$3.11bUS$2.90bUS$2.79bUS$2.73bUS$2.71bUS$2.70bUS$2.72bUS$2.75bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x5Est @ -10.07%Est @ -6.45%Est @ -3.92%Est @ -2.15%Est @ -0.91%Est @ -0.04%Est @ 0.56%Est @ 0.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$2.6kUS$3.0kUS$2.5kUS$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$47bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$47b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$22bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$42b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$78.5, the company appears quite good value at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LyondellBasell Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.153. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Aggregates cash gross profit per ton improved by 9 percent, a considerable acceleration from the first half of the year. This momentum, along with the ongoing favorable pricing environment and current visibility into private nonresidential and infrastructure demand, reinforces our confidence in our ability to deliver strong earnings growth in 2022.""Highlights as of September 30, 2022 include:Third QuarterYear to DateTrailing-Twelve MonthsAmounts in millions, except per unit data202220212022202120222021Total revenues$ 2,088.3$ 1,516.5$ 5,583.3$ 3,945.9$ 7,189.6$ 5,121.0Gross profit$ 492.9$ 394.1$ 1,207.8$ 1,021.7$ 1,559.5$ 1,324.4Aggregates segmentSegment sales$ 1,490.5$ 1,172.4$ 4,013.5$ 3,192.7$ 5,165.8$ 4,149.2Freight-adjusted revenues$ 1,097.2$ 898.0$ 2,956.5$ 2,453.1$ 3,817.4$ 3,190.4Gross profit$ 436.1$ 372.4$ 1,081.3$ 969.8$ 1,407.2$ 1,245.8Shipments (tons)65.460.2182.2165.1239.9216.3Freight-adjusted sales price per ton$ 16.79$ 14.93$ 16.23$ 14.86$ 15.91$ 14.75Gross profit per ton$ 6.67$ 6.19$ 5.94$ 5.87$ 5.87$ 5.76Asphalt, Concrete &amp; Calcium segment gross profit$ 56.8$ 21.7$ 126.5$ 51.9$ 152.3$ 78.6Selling, Administrative and General (SAG)$ 135.3$ 103.8$ 388.7$ 293.1$ 513.2$ 391.7SAG as % of Total revenues6.5 %6.8 %7.0 %7.4 %7.1 %7.6 %Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes$ 260.6$ 228.7$ 637.4$ 705.1$ 806.1$ 846.3Net earnings attributable to Vulcan$ 177.1$ 176.9$ 456.2$ 532.9$ 594.2$ 647.4Adjusted EBITDA$ 507.0$ 417.7$ 1,251.0$ 1,068.0$ 1,634.3$ 1,379.2Earnings attributable to Vulcan from continuing operations per diluted share$ 1.33$ 1.33$ 3.54$ 4.01$ 4.58$ 4.88Adjusted earnings attributable to Vulcan from continuing operations per diluted share$ 1.78$ 1.54$ 4.03$ 3.80$ 5.28$ 4.86Segment ResultsAggregatesSegment gross profit was $436 million, an increase of 17 percent from the prior year. Cash gross profit per ton increased 9 percent to $8.41 per ton. Double-digit price growth and solid operational execution helped offset cost headwinds, including significantly higher diesel fuel costs ($27 million) and continued inflationary pressures for many other parts and supplies.Story continuesPrice growth in the third quarter was consistently strong across the Company's markets. Freight-adjusted pricing was $16.79 per ton, an increase of $1.86 per ton, or 12 percent, over the prior year. Adjusting for mix impacts, average selling price also increased 12 percent.Total aggregates shipments increased 9 percent, reflecting shipment contribution from acquisitions and healthy construction activity levels. On a same-store basis, shipments increased 3 percent. Shipment growth was geographically widespread and particularly strong in many southeastern markets and California.Freight-adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 17 percent, or $1.19 per ton, as compared to the prior year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of higher diesel fuel costs, freight-adjusted cash cost of sales increased 11 percent, or $0.77 per ton.Asphalt, Concrete and CalciumAsphalt segment gross profit was $30 million, an increase of $22 million over the prior year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by widespread volume improvement and continued pricing momentum. Asphalt volumes increased 13 percent, driven by growth in Arizona and California, the Company's two largest asphalt markets. Asphalt pricing increased 26 percent, or $15.37 per ton, more than offsetting a 42 percent ($33 million) increase in the average price paid for liquid asphalt as well as a $3 million year-over-year increase in the cost of natural gas.Third quarter Concrete segment gross profit was $26 million, an increase of $12 million over the prior year. Concrete results benefited from the contribution of acquired operations as well as strong volume and price growth in the Company's legacy operations. Unit material margins improved as higher selling prices helped offset higher raw materials costs, including aggregates supplied by the Company.Calcium segment gross profit was $0.8 million compared to $0.3 million in the prior year quarter.Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) and Other ItemsSAG expense was $135 million in the quarter, or 6.5 percent of total revenues. Higher expenses versus the prior year were driven by elevated legal and professional fees, related mostly to Mexico and business development activities, and increased incentives driven by favorable current-year performance. Trailing-twelve-months SAG expense was 7.1 percent of total revenues, 50 basis points less than the prior year. The Company remains focused on further leveraging its overhead cost structure.This year's third quarter included the sale of real estate in California. This transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $24 million ($18 million after-tax). The Company continues to maximize the value of its portfolio of quarry operations as they move through the life cycle of land management.We are currently finalizing an agreement for the disposition of our concrete assets in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. As a result, these assets were classified as held for sale during the quarter and were written down to their fair value, resulting in a pretax loss of $68 million ($63 million after-tax), including the write-off of the associated goodwill.Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital AllocationCapital expenditures in the third quarter were $138 million, including both maintenance and growth projects. Through the first nine months of 2022, capital expenditures were $378 million. For the full year, the Company expects to spend $600 to $650 million. Full-year capital expenditures include spending for U.S. Concrete operations acquired in August 2021 as well as spending for projects put on hold in 2020 due to the pandemic. The Company will continue to review its plans and will adjust as needed, while being thoughtful about preserving liquidity.During the quarter, we acquired strategic aggregates and downstream assets to complement our position in Northern California. Additionally, we acquired a quarry in Honduras from which we have been distributing materials to certain Gulf Coast markets since 2019.On September 30, 2022, the ratio of total debt to trailing-twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA was 2.6 times (2.5 times on a net debt basis). The Company remains committed to its stated long-term target leverage range of 2.0 to 2.5 times total debt to trailing-twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA.On a trailing-twelve-months basis, return on invested capital was 13.6 percent. The Company is focused on driving further improvement through solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management.OutlookRegarding the Company's current outlook for 2022, Mr. Hill said, ""We have continued to execute well and now expect full-year Adjusted EBITDA of $1.640 to $1.680 billion. Through the first nine months, aggregates shipments have exceeded the upper end of our expectations, driven by acquisitions and healthy underlying demand in our markets.""Mr. Hill continued, ""As we look ahead to 2023, leading indicators suggest that growing public construction activity, particularly highways, and the recovery in private nonresidential contract awards should help to offset contracting single-family residential demand. The pricing environment remains positive, and we carry strong momentum into 2023.""Mr. Hill concluded, ""Our industry-leading aggregates focus positions us well for continued growth and value creation. We have a durable business model with strong fundamentals and less execution risk through economic cycles. This durability is evidenced by the consistent growth in our aggregates unit profitability, despite ongoing volatility in the macro environment. We are positioned in geographic markets that will continue to outperform other parts of the country from a demand perspective, both in the near term and longer term, and we expect both the favorable pricing dynamics and our strong execution to lead to continued earnings growth.""Conference Call Vulcan will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. CDT on November 2, 2022.

Infrastructure earnings are resilient and it is a low-beta sector, but the space is not suited to outperform during a cyclical economic recovery. New York Life Investments believes that infrastructure earnings will potentially outperform global earnings for the first time in multiple years in 2022. The broader equity market earnings are set to decelerate while the infrastructure industry delivers robust growth. The firm anticipates 10% earnings growth compared to the broader equity market growth of only 7%. Historically, moderating economic growth has been a positive sign for infrastructure. During such economic cycles, infrastructure has reported an average annualized return of about 18.5%, topping global equities by 5%. Moreover, during times of above-average inflation, infrastructure has surpassed global equities by 7% to 9% in terms of annualized returns. With this macroeconomic outlook in mind, New York Life Investments backed 2022 to be a good year for the infrastructure space. Some of the best infrastructure stocks to invest in, to benefit from the acceleration in the sector, include Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH). Our Methodology We selected the firms which are involved directly or indirectly in key infrastructure sectors such as roads, railways, electricity and power, water and sewerage, communication, and airports.

The debate around margin recovery next year remains unresolved for now, the analyst told investors in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 22 funds reported owning stakes worth $136 million in Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK), compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter worth $130.7 million. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management held the leading position in the company, comprising 479,496 shares valued at $38.6 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Value Equity has to say about Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE:OSK) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Oshkosh is typically a North American market share leader in its respective equipment types and supplies a wide swath of industries and end customers. For instance, it is the global leader in aerial work platforms through its JLG brand. It is also the largest light defense truck supplier to the U.S military, with its Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) chosen to replace the Humvee in 2015.We had previously owned Oshkosh in our Value Equity portfolios for the better part of a decade. As long-time admirers of the company’s quality characteristics, and through our diligent process continuing to closely follow as management creates ways to improve, we have once again found an opportunity to be investors.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Oshkosh include:-Pricing power stemming from its leading market share positions in nearly every business segment, vital nature of its products and industry concentration;-Diversified product line and customer base, as well as high barriers to entry in many of its businesses, such as fire trucks, aircraft rescue vehicles and defense; and-Consistent positive FREE cash flow generation, even during the 2008 financial crisis when most of its segments faced the steepest downturn in a generation.Attractive ValuationThrough market share gains, we expect operating margins and FREE cash flow to be higher on a normalized basis. Thus, we believe Oshkosh shares are offered at a discount to our estimates of the company’s intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Oshkosh, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Further innovation and technological improvements, particularly in the electrification of its vehicles, which could drive additional demand;-Continued rollout of its recently awarded U.S. Postal Service vehicle contract and market share gains for its JLG aerial work platforms;-Increased international orders for its JLTV military trucks as countries around the world replace aging Humvee fleets. In addition, further development of its aftermarket business can help improve profitability; and-Strong balance sheet can give management the ability to run a balanced capital allocation strategy that advances organic growth and returns cash to shareholders.”8. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) is a Canadian energy infrastructure company, operating through Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage, Renewable Power Generation, and Energy Services segments. On September 29, Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) disclosed the acquisition of U.S. renewable project developer Tri Global Energy for $270 million in cash and assumed debt. This acquisition will advance Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB)’s renewables business, while strengthening its North American growth strategy. It is one of the premier infrastructure stocks to invest in. Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kad on October 19 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) but trimmed the price target on the stock to C$64 from C$67. The analyst said that he expects fewer material earnings beats in the Midstream sector compared to Q2, but ""nonetheless largely in-line results"". Potential buyback acceleration could be a positive catalyst for some firms, he added.According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 25 hedge funds were long Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB), compared to 24 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 51.85 million shares worth $2.2 billion. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We are meaningfully overweight energy, particularly within North American energy infrastructure. Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”7. Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) is a North Carolina-based company that provides mission-critical air, fluid, energy, specialty vehicle and medical technologies in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific.

(NYSE:IR)’s presence in India and France, respectively. The deals are expected to conclude in Q4 2022. Morgan Stanley analyst Joshua Pokrzywinski on October 12 reiterated an Overweight rating on Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) but slashed the price target on the shares to $53 from $55. He forecasts Q3 results to be ""largely in line"" for the multi-industry group and sees most revisions due to foreign exchange headwinds. However, Q3 results are likely to give way to volatility and ""an air pocket for orders"" in Q4, the analyst added.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were bullish on Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 31 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:IR) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Ingersoll Rand is a global market leader with a broad range of mission critical flow creation technologies (pumps, compressors, etc.) for industrial and medical applications. The company’s recent Q3 results were solid and support our belief it is making the right investments in R&amp;D and acquisitions to elevate its sustainable revenue growth rate. We have been particularly encouraged by the important role IR’s products can play in reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of manufacturing facilities. With an increasingly visible organic and acquisition-driven growth capability and further margin upside from the Gardner Denver merger, we added to our position as the market appears to be underappreciating the transformation underway at the company.”6. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is a North Carolina-based company that manufactures and sells steel and steel products. The company provides hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and galvanized sheet steel products, concrete reinforcing and merchant bars, steel tubing products, electrical conduits, ferro-alloys, and wire and wire mesh products. It serves agriculture, automotive, construction, energy and transmission, oil and gas, heavy equipment, infrastructure, and transportation industries. The management expects 2022 to be the most profitable year for earnings in Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)’s history.On October 6, Goldman Sachs analyst Emily Chieng reaffirmed a Neutral rating on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) but lowered the price target on the shares to $114 from $127. The analyst sees Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) as well positioned to gain from improving construction and infrastructure demand given its ""strong portfolio of products serving those end markets."" According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 32 hedge funds were bullish on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), up from 22 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares worth approximately $135 million. Like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is one of the top infrastructure players to consider for riding the boom in the sector. Here is what Madison Funds has to say about Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Nucor (NUE) as a relative yield example within the Materials sector. NUE is a leading manufacturer of steel and steel products. It is the largest steelmaker in the U.S. based on production volume with a vertically integrated business model. The company has a low fixed-cost position due to its use of electric arc furnaces, which are cleaner, less labor and energy-intensive than blast furnaces, and this results in low total costs per unit of steel produced. Our view is that a low cost position is an important attribute in a commodity business. NUE’s historical financial record supports this view as it has been profitable every year except for one over the past fifty years, unlike many steel producing peers. In addition, the company has a diverse product and mill portfolio that takes market share over time. We believe its scale, low fixed-cost position, consistent record of profitability and diverse mill portfolio result in a sustainable competitive advantage versus peers.Our thesis on NUE is that it should benefit from higher steel prices as the U.S. economy recovers from the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company may also be a beneficiary of on-shoring, where manufacturing returns to the United States. These two dynamics should drive growth this year, and if the United States Congress passes new infrastructure legislation, that will provide another avenue for growth longer-term.""

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is Phillips 66 (PSX). PSX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.PSX is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.64. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PSX's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.69. Within the past year, PSX's PEG has been as high as 2.40 and as low as 0.48, with a median of 0.62.Investors should also recognize that PSX has a P/B ratio of 2.04. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.05. Over the past 12 months, PSX's P/B has been as high as 2.40 and as low as 1.45, with a median of 1.72.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PSX has a P/S ratio of 0.33. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.34.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing value stock, take a look at Valero Energy (VLO). VLO is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Shares of Valero Energy currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 6.19, and its PEG ratio is 1.03. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 5.32 and 0.69.Over the last 12 months, VLO's P/E has been as high as 57.89, as low as 4.79, with a median of 11.04, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 12.91, as low as 0.80, with a median of 1.85.Valero Energy also has a P/B ratio of 2.09 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2.05. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.47, with a median of 1.87.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Phillips 66 and Valero Energy are likely undervalued currently.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on UnitedHealth Group's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:24% = US$20b ÷ US$83b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.24 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 24% ROETo begin with, UnitedHealth Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for UnitedHealth Group's moderate 12% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then compared UnitedHealth Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 18% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is UNH fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is UnitedHealth Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?UnitedHealth Group has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 30% (or a retention ratio of 70%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, UnitedHealth Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 26% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that UnitedHealth Group's future ROE will be 28% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with UnitedHealth Group's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

A lower ratio indicates a tight rein on the insurer's medical costs.Humana's guidance to enroll 325,000 to 400,000 Medicare Advantage members next year marks a return to the industry's rate one year ahead of schedule, Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said in a note.Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard said the insurer could probably do a ""medium to smaller"" deal at this time in the primary care business.""We've looked at some of the larger transactions out there ... not really convinced that's the right direction for us,"" Broussard said.Recent mediareportshave suggested that Humana is among the top bidders to acquire primary care provider Cano Health Inc.Humana said its adjusted profit for the third quarter was $6.88 per share, above estimates of $6.28, according to Refinitiv data.

REG is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3 after the closing bell. The company’s quarterly results might display a year-over-year decline in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Jacksonville, FL-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported a surprise of 5.26% in terms of NAREIT FFO per share. The quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated top-line growth and solid leasing activity.Over the trailing four quarters, the company’s FFO per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the same in the remaining quarter, the average beat being 4.80%. This is depicted in the graph below:Regency Centers Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRegency Centers Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRegency Centers Corporation price-eps-surprise | Regency Centers Corporation QuoteFactors to NotePer a report from CBRE Group CBRE, retail metrics remained positive in the third quarter, given the onset of the holiday season. The core retail sales, excluding gasoline and automobiles, climbed 8.2% from the prior-year period. The overall retail availability rate fell nearly a full percentage point year over year to 5% in the third quarter. The average asking rent increased by 2.5% year over year to $22.55 per square foot in the third quarter.The absorption of 14.3 million square feet in the third quarter was less than half the level a year ago, but it was 8% higher than the third-quarter 2019 level. Also, new deliveries aggregated 25.1 million square feet over the past 12 months and marked a record low, per the CBRE Group report.Regency is also expected to have benefited from the recovery in the retail real estate market. It has a high-quality open-air shopping center portfolio with 80% grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers. The properties are mainly situated in affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas where consumers have high spending power, enabling it to attract top grocers and retailers.Regency also maintains a high-quality tenant roster with numerous industry-leading grocers.However, the overall choppiness in the economy is likely to have cast a pall. Inflationary impacts on consumers and a softer economic backdrop are likely to have affected the business.Moreover, the company is not immune to the adverse impacts of inflation, interest rate increases and recessionary risks, and these might have affected its volume of leasing activity and leasing spreads. Also, expenses are likely to have remained elevated.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $298.7 million, suggesting a decrease of 2.82% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Regency’s activities during the soon-to-be-reported quarter were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter FFO per share has been revised a cent downward to 95 cents over the past month. It also suggests a 1.04% decline year over year.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for Regency this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an FFO beat.

(NYSE: EL) today reported net sales of $3.93 billion for its first quarter ended September 30, 2022, a decline of 11% from $4.39 billion in the prior-year period, including negative impacts from foreign currency. Organic net sales fell 5%, in line with the Company’s expectations, despite pressures which intensified as the quarter progressed. COVID-19 restrictions in China presented a greater challenge than expected. Tourism to Hainan was largely curtailed, which led to strict inventory management by certain retailers in travel retail, and traffic in brick-and-mortar in the rest of China was limited. These greater pressures were offset by several markets in Asia/Pacific, as well as many emerging and developed markets in the west, which delivered strong organic net sales growth. Organic net sales in both fragrance and hair care grew double digits.The Company reported net earnings of $489 million, compared with net earnings of $692 million in the prior-year period2. Diluted net earnings per common share was $1.35, compared with $1.88 reported in the prior-year period. Excluding restructuring and other charges as detailed on page 3, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share declined 28% to $1.37, decreasing 24% in constant currency, better than the Company’s expectations. This decline includes a negative impact of 4% from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations.Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer said, ""For the first quarter, we delivered organic sales in line with our outlook and adjusted EPS ahead of it even as the transitory external pressures of COVID-19 restrictions in China, high inflation globally, and a strong U.S. dollar intensified. Our multiple engines of growth strategy empowered us to seize prevailing growth opportunities amid the complexity.Story continues""Fragrance and Hair Care each rose double digits organically, and Makeup’s renaissance continued to realize its promise in markets reopening. Skin Care was the most challenged by COVID-19 restrictions in China, which significantly impacted the category in travel retail. All told, 13 brands grew organically, as M·A·C excelled in Makeup, La Mer in luxury Skin Care, Jo Malone London in Fragrance, and Aveda in Hair Care. Encouragingly, we realized strong double-digit gains in many large developed and emerging markets around the world.""_________________________________1 Organic net sales represents net sales excluding returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures; as well as the impact from foreign currency translation. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP measure of organic net sales growth provides year-over-year sales comparisons on a consistent basis. See page 2 for reconciliations to GAAP.2 Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. which excludes net (earnings) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 and noncontrolling interests for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.Freda concluded, ""For fiscal 2023, we are lowering our outlook primarily to reflect tighter inventory management in Asia travel retail, given reduced traffic as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, tightening of inventory by some retailers in the United States, and a greater negative impact from the far-stronger U.S. dollar. We anticipate sequential acceleration to strong organic sales and adjusted EPS growth in the second half of our fiscal year as these pressures begin to abate, momentum continues to build in other areas of our business, and our ongoing investments in innovation and advertising drive growth. Our optimism in the long-term growth opportunities for our brands and for prestige beauty remains intact. Reflecting our confidence, today we raised our quarterly dividend.""Business UpdateThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to disrupt the Company’s operating environment through the fiscal 2023 first quarter, including COVID-related restrictions in China, affecting travel retail in Hainan as well as retail traffic in mainland China. In Hainan, the ongoing restrictions led to prolonged store closures and the curtailment of travel and caused the tightening of inventory by certain retailers who had previously placed orders in anticipation of the return of travel that was since delayed.During the quarter, the Company’s business was also negatively impacted by inflationary pressures and recession concerns, which caused certain retailers in the United States to tighten inventory.Fiscal 2023 First Quarter ResultsProduct category and geographic region net sales commentary reflect organic performance.Reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP Net Sales Growth(Unaudited)Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2022As Reported - GAAP(1)(11)%Organic, Non-GAAP(2)(5)%Impact of the license terminations related to certain of the Company’s designer fragrances(1)Impact of foreign currency translation(4)Returns associated with restructuring and other activities(1)As Reported - GAAP(1)(11)%(1)Includes returns associated with restructuring and other activities(2)Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth excluding returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures (the license terminations related to certain of the Company’s designer fragrances); as well as the impact of foreign currency translation.Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share excludes restructuring and other charges and adjustments as detailed in the following table.Reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP - Diluted Net Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")(Unaudited)Three Months EndedSeptember 3020222021GrowthAs Reported EPS - GAAP(1)$1.35 $1.88 (28)%Non-GAAPRestructuring and other charges.02.01Adjusted EPS - Non-GAAP$1.37 $1.89 (28)%Impact of foreign currency translation on earnings per share.06Adjusted Constant Currency EPS - Non-GAAP$1.43 $1.89 (24)%(1)Includes restructuring and other chargesNet sales and operating income in the Company’s product categories and regions were unfavorably impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies.

The tightening of inventory by certain retailers in the United States also negatively impacted the category’s growth. Net sales growth from La Mer, Bobbi Brown and The Ordinary was offset by declines from Estée Lauder, Dr.Jart+ and Origins.Growth from La Mer reflected increases in hero products, including the upgrade to The Treatment Lotion and Crème de la Mer, and targeted expanded consumer reach.Bobbi Brown net sales grew double digits across every region, driven by increases in hero products, including Soothing Cleansing Oil and Vitamin Enriched Face Base, and targeted expanded consumer reach.Hero products drove net sales growth from The Ordinary.Net sales from Estée Lauder, Dr.Jart+ and Origins declined, reflecting challenges due to the COVID-related restrictions in China, including those impacting travel retail. Strong innovation from Estée Lauder, including the launches of Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliance Serum and the new Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Creme Synchronized Multi-Recovery Eye Cream, partially offset the decline in net sales.Skin care operating income decreased, reflecting the decline in net sales, partially offset by disciplined expense management.MakeupMakeup net sales decreased 6%, primarily reflecting the ongoing COVID-related restrictions impacting travel retail in Hainan and mainland China, partially offset by the progression of the makeup renaissance as usage occasions increased in many markets. The decline in net sales also reflected a difficult comparison due to the timing of shipments in the prior-year period when certain retailers secured earlier shipments for holiday. Net sales growth from M·A·C was offset by declines from Estée Lauder and Tom Ford Beauty.M·A·C high single-digit net sales growth was driven by hero products, such as Studio Fix foundation and Matte Lipstick, the recent launches of M·A·CStack mascara and Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick lipstick, and the recovery in brick-and-mortar, as the brand’s high-touch services drove conversion.Net sales from Estée Lauder and Tom Ford Beauty were negatively impacted by the decline in retail traffic and travel due to the COVID-related restrictions.Net sales grew strong double digits in both Southeast Asia and in the emerging markets in Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa.Makeup operating income decreased, primarily reflecting lower net sales, partially offset by disciplined expense management.FragranceNet sales grew in every region and across all brands that sell fragrances, driven by continued desirability of the Company’s luxury and artisanal fragrance portfolio and strategic expansion of freestanding stores. The Company achieved strong growth despite global supply constraints, particularly of glass.The license terminations related to certain of the Company’s designer fragrances was dilutive to reported net sales growth by approximately 12 percentage points.Tom Ford Beauty net sales grew strong double digits, powered by launches, such as Noir Extreme Parfum and Ebene Fume, as well as organic growth in existing hero franchises like Oud Wood and Ombre Leather.Jo Malone London net sales grew high single digits primarily driven by strength in colognes, particularly in hero franchises, as well as strength in home and bath &amp; body. The Night Collection and the fiscal 2022 Brit Collection also contributed to growth.Net sales from Le Labo rose strong double digits, primarily reflecting growth in brick-and-mortar, and targeted expanded consumer reach. Growth was driven by hero fragrances, such as Santal 33, as well as the annual City Exclusives collection.Increased productive distribution in select retailers and the success of the Clinique Happy franchise line of products drove double-digit growth from the brand.Fragrance operating income increased, driven primarily by disciplined expense management.Hair CareHair care net sales rose 11%, reflecting growth in every region and brand.Aveda’s net sales growth reflected strength in Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa, the launch of the brand in mainland China, the continued success of its hero franchises, including Botanical Repair, and the launch of the Color Control franchise line of products.Net sales from DECIEM benefited from the recent launch of The Ordinary’s hair care products.Hair care operating results decreased, reflecting strategic investments to support innovation, partially offset by higher net sales.Results by Geographic Region(Unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30Net SalesPercentage ChangeOperatingIncome (Loss)PercentageChange($ in millions)20222021ReportedBasisConstantCurrency20222021ReportedBasisThe Americas$1,123$1,194(6)%(7)%$125$254(51)%Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa1,6821,873(10)(6)334465(28)Asia/Pacific1,1301,326(15)(7)208222(6)Subtotal$3,935$4,393(10)%(6)%$667$941(29)%Returns/charges associated with restructuring andother activities(5)(1)(6)(6)Total$3,930$4,392(11)%(7)%$661$935(29)%Organic Net Sales Growth - Reconciliation to GAAP(Unaudited)Three Months Ended September 302022 vs. 2021OrganicNet SalesGrowth(Non-GAAP)(1)Impact ofAcquisitions,Divestitures andBrand Closures, NetImpact ofForeignCurrencyTranslationNet SalesGrowth(GAAP)The Americas(3)%(4)%1%(6)%Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa(5)(1)(4)(10)Asia/Pacific(7)—(8)(15)Subtotal(5)%(1)%(4)%(10)%Returns associated with restructuring and other activities(1)Total(5)%(1)%(4)%(11)%(1)Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth excluding returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures (the license terminations related to certain of the Company’s designer fragrances); as well as the impact of foreign currency translation.The AmericasNet sales declined 3%, driven by a difficult comparison to the prior-year period when some retailers in the United States secured orders earlier for holiday due to global logistics constraints, as well as the negative impact in the current year from tighter inventory management by certain retailers.The license terminations related to certain of the Company’s designer fragrances contributed approximately 4 percentage points to the decline in reported net sales.In Latin America, net sales grew double digits, fueled by growth in the Makeup category.Operating income in The Americas decreased, reflecting the decline in net sales while the Company continued to support strategic investments in advertising and promotional activities.Europe, the Middle East &amp; AfricaNet sales declined 5%, primarily due to the continued challenges from the COVID-related restrictions affecting travel retail in Hainan.The license terminations related to certain of the Company’s designer fragrances contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the decline in reported net sales.Double-digit net sales growth from DECIEM drove the increase in net sales in the United Kingdom.Net sales from most emerging markets in the region increased, led by India, the Middle East and Turkey, driven by growth in the makeup category. Developed markets also grew, led by Spain, Italy and Germany.Global travel retail net sales decreased double digits, reflecting the ongoing travel restrictions in China that led to reduced travel, particularly to Hainan. Travel retail net sales grew in Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa and The Americas, benefiting from increased resumption of professional and personal travel compared to the prior-year period.Operating income decreased, driven by the decline in net sales, partially offset by disciplined expense management.Asia/PacificNet sales declined, due to the ongoing COVID-related restrictions impacting brick-and-mortar in Greater China and Dr.Jart+ travel retail in Korea.In other markets in Asia/Pacific, COVID recovery drove strong net sales growth in most countries, led by Thailand, Malaysia and Japan. In Korea, double-digit growth from nearly all brands was more than offset by the decline from Dr.Jart+’s travel retail business.Net sales declined in skin care and makeup, reflecting the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, and were only partly offset by net sales growth from fragrance and hair care in the region.Operating income decreased, driven by the decline in net sales, partially offset by disciplined expense management.Cash FlowsFor the three months ended September 30, 2022, net cash flows used for operating activities were $650 million, compared with $81 million in the prior-year period. This reflects higher working capital, primarily accounts payable, due to the timing of payments, and higher inventory levels, as well as lower earnings before taxes, excluding non-cash items.Capital Expenditures decreased to $152 million compared to $205 million last year, primarily reflecting timing of investments and favorable foreign currency translation relating to the new manufacturing facility in Japan.The Company ended the quarter with $2.94 billion in cash and cash equivalents after returning $0.33 billion cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.Outlook for Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter and Full YearThe Company expects the remainder of the fiscal year to be pressured by the temporary disruptions due to headwinds from the COVID-19 restrictions in China, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, record-high inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the risk of a slowdown in certain markets globally. The Company remains optimistic about the prospects and future growth in global prestige beauty and plans to invest in its business during this difficult environment to support share gains and long-term growth. With multiple engines of growth across regions, brands, product categories and channels, the Company is well-positioned to drive diversified growth across its portfolio as it manages through these challenges.The full year outlook reflects the following assumptions and expectations:Ongoing tightening of inventory by certain of our retailers in Asia travel retail and in the United States.A more tempered expectation on the timing of traffic recovery in travel retail in Hainan to the second half of the fiscal year.Increased productive distribution throughout the year to retailers that provide new consumer reach and continued strategic entry into new countries for some of our brands.The mitigation of most inflationary pressures through strategic price increases, mix optimization and cost savings in other areas.Incremental savings from the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program and reinvestment in advertising and capabilities.Full-year effective tax rate of approximately 25%.The Company is mindful of ongoing risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as risks related to the effects of the global macro environment, including the risk of recession; foreign currency volatility; increasing inflationary pressures; supply chain disruptions; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. The Company is also mindful of inflationary pressures on our cost base and consumer behaviors.Second Quarter Fiscal 2023Sales OutlookReported net sales are forecasted to decrease between 19% and 17% versus the prior-year period. This range includes the negative impacts from tighter inventory management in travel retail in response to the decreased traffic driven by COVID-related restrictions, foreign currency translation of 7% as well as an additional unfavorable impact from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of 2%, and the termination of the Company’s license agreements for the Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Ermenegildo Zegna product lines effective June 30, 2022.Organic net sales, which excludes returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures; as well as the impact of foreign currency translation, are forecasted to decrease between 11% and 9%. This includes the negative impact related to foreign currency transactions, noted above.Earnings per Share OutlookDespite the forecasted decrease in net sales, the Company plans to continue to make strategic investments to drive long-term growth, including investments in advertising, innovation, its innovation center in Shanghai and its manufacturing facility in Japan. These investments will have a greater impact to diluted net earnings per common share due to the expected decline in net sales.Reported diluted net earnings per common share are projected to be between $1.14 and $1.26. Excluding restructuring and other charges, diluted net earnings per common share are projected to be between $1.19 and $1.29.Adjusted diluted earnings per common share are expected to decrease between 54% and 50% on a constant currency basis. Currency exchange rates are volatile and difficult to predict. Using mid-October 2022 spot rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2023:The negative foreign currency translation impact equates to about $.20 of diluted earnings per share.The impact from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations, which is included in the constant currency decline of 54% to 50%, is expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 7%.Full Year Fiscal 2023The Company expects its first-half results to be negatively impacted by the ongoing challenges from the COVID-related restrictions affecting Asia travel retail, including tightening of retailer inventory, and mainland China. The Company also expects the tightening of inventory in the United States to negatively impact its first-half results. For the second half, the Company expects sequential improvement to its results and a gradual recovery as restrictions are lifted, travel resumes to Hainan and the tightening of inventory subsides.Sales OutlookReported net sales are forecasted to decrease between 8% and 6% versus the prior-year period. This range includes:Tighter inventory management in travel retail in response to the decreased traffic driven by COVID-related restrictions.A negative 6% due to foreign currency translation, as well as an additional 2% due to certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations.The negative impact of 1% from the termination of the Company’s license agreements for the Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Ermenegildo Zegna product lines effective June 30, 2022.A negative impact of 1% related to returns associated with restructuring and other activities.Organic net sales, which excludes returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures; as well as the impact of foreign currency translation, are forecasted to be flat to increase by 2%. This includes the negative impact related to foreign currency transactions, noted above.Earnings per Share OutlookDespite the forecasted decrease in net sales, the Company plans to continue to make strategic investments to drive long-term growth, including investments in advertising, innovation, its innovation center in Shanghai and its manufacturing facility in Japan. These investments will have a greater impact to diluted net earnings per common share due to the expected decline in net sales.Reported diluted net earnings per common share are projected to be between $5.01 and $5.21. Excluding restructuring and other charges, diluted net earnings per common share are projected to be between $5.25 and $5.40.Adjusted diluted earnings per common share are expected to decrease between 21% and 19% on a constant currency basis. Currency exchange rates are volatile and difficult to predict. Using mid-October 2022 spot rates for fiscal 2023:The negative foreign currency translation impact equates to about $.44 of diluted earnings per share.The impact from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations, which is included in the constant currency decline of 21% to 19%, is expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 10%.Reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP - Net Sales Growth(Unaudited)Three Months EndingTwelve Months EndingDecember 31, 2022(F)June 30, 2023(F)As Reported - GAAP(1)(19%) - (17%)(8%) - (6%)Organic, Non-GAAP(2)(11%) - (9%)0% - 2%Impact of the license terminations related to certain of our designerfragrances(1)(1)Impact of foreign currency translation(7)(6)Returns associated with restructuring and other activities—(1)As Reported - GAAP(1)(19%) - (17%)(8%) - (6%)(1)Includes returns associated with restructuring and other activities(2)Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth excluding returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts of already announced acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures (the license terminations related to certain of our designer fragrances); as well as the impact of foreign currency translation.(F)Represents forecastReconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP - Diluted Net Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")(Unaudited)Three Months EndingTwelve Months EndingDecember 31June 302022(F)2021Growth2023(F)2022VarianceForecasted/As Reported EPS - GAAP(1)$1.14 - $1.26 $2.97 (62%) - (58%)$5.01 - $5.21 $6.55(23%) - (20%)Non-GAAPRestructuring and other charges.03 - .05.03.19 - .24.31Change in fair value of acquisition-related stockoptions (less the portion attributable toredeemable noncontrolling interest)—.01—(.12)Goodwill, other intangible and long-lived assetimpairments———.50Forecasted/Adjusted EPS - Non-GAAP$1.19- $1.29 $3.01 (60%) - (57%)$5.25 - $5.40 $7.24(27%) - (25%)Impact of foreign currency translation.20.44Forecasted/Adjusted Constant Currency EPS -Non-GAAP$1.39 - $1.49 $3.01 (54%) - (50%)$5.69 - $5.84 $7.24(21%) - (19%)(1)Includes restructuring and other charges and adjustments(F)Represents forecastConference Call The Estée Lauder Companies will host a conference call at 9:30 a.m. (ET) today, November 2, 2022 to discuss its results.

You can skip our detailed analysis of safe stocks, and go directly to read 5 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Recent selloffs have devastated several equities, and investors are still divided on whether the market has reached oversold territory. Some predict a recession and blame it on the Federal Reserve's (Fed) upcoming interest rate increases, while others blame the gigantic valuations of major tech companies. Whatever it may be, the stock market is presently quite volatile. Uncertainty levels are at an all-time high as the Fed fights against inflation and a weakening economy. The Fed cannot deploy quantitative easing to boost the economy, unlike in 2008 and 2020. Inflation will only get worse if this is done.However, just because there is uncertainty in the stock market doesn't mean investors should stay out. Contrarily, historically speaking, bear markets have been a great investment opportunity. Additionally, investors have choices on how to put their money to work. Buy safe investments to weather the short-term storm and steadily increase your wealth over time if you don't have the stomach for more volatility or danger.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:We turn to the smart money to see how they are playing the current turmoil. For this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 895 hedge funds and picked some of the safest stocks these funds were piling into as of the end of June. These are safe, blue-chip companies. Some of them have long-term growth potential while others pay consistent dividend income without any uncertainty. Some of the notable names in the list include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), among others.Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 55Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) specializes in producing and distributing healthcare, household, and personal care products. On October 17, Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers lowered his price target on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to $85 from $87 but kept a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst anticipates Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to release a ""solid set"" of third-quarter financial results, with persistent pressure on gross margins offset by robust organic growth evenly distributed across all regional divisions including its per food segment Hill's.Story continuesThe company was a popular stock among elite funds in Q2 2022, as 55 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the stock, up from 50 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of nearly $3 billion.According to CNBC, Third Point's Loeb sees unrecognized value in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) Hill business. Here is what Third Point specifically said about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 60The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage manufacturer with a brand portfolio of 200 brands of soft drinks, coffee, teas, and water across more than 200 countries and regions. Berkshire Hathaway’s holding of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) remained unchanged during the second quarter of 2022, and the fund had an investment value of approximately $25 billion in the company at the end of Q2 2022. The fund is the leading shareholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) out of the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey during Q2.Given the relatively stable demand for its products, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shares are up 0.39% year to date and the company remains very profitable despite the economic headwinds. It released its latest quarter results on October 25, reporting an EPS of $0.69, beating estimates by $0.05, and revenue of $11.10 billion, beating the estimates by $602.57 million.On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom raised his price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $68 from $63 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst's research note to investors, the company's Q3 earnings performance was ""impressive"" since organic growth more than offset further currency challenges. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) risk/reward ratio appears positive, says Grom, given that its shares have recently underperformed and there is a possibility for better revenue growth to support a prolonged premium compared to its competitors.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion.Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”09. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 61Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American manufacturer of healthcare products worldwide. It operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. On September 15, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a $0.47 per share quarterly dividend, which is payable on November 15 to shareholders of record on October 14.

Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”08.

(NASDAQ:SRCL) By 47%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-stericycle-inc-nasdaq-101528329.html,1667384128,STORY,['SRCL'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Stericycle The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$223.0mUS$312.0mUS$396.0mUS$435.0mUS$463.9mUS$488.2mUS$509.0mUS$527.3mUS$543.6mUS$558.6mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.64%Est @ 5.24%Est @ 4.26%Est @ 3.58%Est @ 3.1%Est @ 2.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$207US$269US$317US$324US$321US$314US$304US$292US$280US$267(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.9bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$559m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$10bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$10b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$4.8bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$7.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$44.6, the company appears quite good value at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Stericycle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.107. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Eaton Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.22bUS$3.32bUS$3.94bUS$3.86bUS$3.84bUS$3.85bUS$3.88bUS$3.92bUS$3.97bUS$4.03bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ -0.59%Est @ 0.18%Est @ 0.72%Est @ 1.1%Est @ 1.36%Est @ 1.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.5% US$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$3.0kUS$2.7kUS$2.4kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

A considerable amount of oil is used as coolant during the grinding of these components, which is then filtered to remove contaminants and enable its reuse. However, even after this process, around 300 tons of unusable grinding sludge is still left per year.Classified as EWC 12 01 18 hazardous waste, this sludge is a mixture of used grinding oil and metal fragments. Posing a significant risk to both human and ecological health due to its high oil content, this sludge is costly and labor intensive to dispose of safely.In 2019, we invested in a new briquetting press to enhance our oil filtration process and optimize waste management. The briquette machine reduces the amount of hazardous grinding sludge created by converting it into non-hazardous solid blocks, while also enabling more oil to be recaptured.Investing to protect the environmentSince oil filtration grinding sludge is produced in large quantities at Bosconero, we targeted it as the first step in our waste reduction initiative.A briquetting press compresses the metal fragments in grinding sludge to create solid, safe, and easy-to-handle cylindrical blocks. This compression process also extracts more oil for reuse.These blocks are left with an oil content under the threshold for hazardous material and their solid state also prevents oil from seeping into the environment. Furthermore, with a nickel density of 10-15%, ‘briquettes' are ideal for recycling.While we already had an older press at the Bosconero facility, it was less effective-requiring regular maintenance, recovering a smaller amount of oil, and being unable to produce briquettes certified as non-hazardous at the end of the process. To address these issues, we invested in a new press connected to the site's oil filtration system. We also established a commercial agreement to sell our briquettes to a preferred supplier that specializes in processing scrap metal for reuse in other industries.Story continuesLess waste, more recyclingThe initiative in Bosconero reflects our firm commitment to prevent pollution, to protect our communities, and to conserve natural resources wherever possible.We've significantly reduced the volume of hazardous grinding sludge created in our operations. With a new briquetting press added to our oil filtration system, we are now recapturing around 45 m3 of oil for reuse per year, as well as producing safe briquettes high in nickel that are ideal for recycling. Furthermore, thanks to our commercial agreement, these leftover manufacturing materials are enabling a circular economy.As well as reducing waste to landfill and our consumption of fresh oil, our ability to rework safe materials has also enabled significant savings and easier waste management. Additionally, the resale of this valuable manufacturing byproduct has turned a major operating cost into a new revenue stream.As a result of our success at Bosconero, our other vehicle plants are implementing similar recycling initiatives.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Eaton on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: EatonWebsite: https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/company/sustainability.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: EatonView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/723285/Transforming-Manufacturing-Waste-to-Protect-the-Environment]"

This compares to earnings of $1.75 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this power management company would post earnings of $1.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.87, delivering a surprise of 2.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Eaton , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, posted revenues of $5.31 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.22%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.92 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Eaton shares have lost about 13.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Eaton?While Eaton has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Eaton: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.06 on $5.36 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.55 on $20.74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Electronics is currently in the bottom 34% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc. (PPSI), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -120%.

496,55960052-3cea-3eab-93e8-24c575435bbf,FRT,2022-11-02,What's in Store for Federal Realty (FRT) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-federal-realty-frt-153003722.html,1667316603,STORY,['FRT'],"[Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT is set to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3 after market close. The company’s quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year increases in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this retail REIT reported a surprise of 10.00% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues.Over the last four quarters, Federal Realty surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average beat being 9.10%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS SurpriseFederal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS SurpriseFederal Realty Investment Trust price-eps-surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key FactorsPer a report from CBRE Group CBRE, retail metrics remained positive in the third quarter, given the onset of the holiday season. The core retail sales, excluding gasoline and automobiles, climbed 8.2% from the prior-year period. The overall retail availability rate fell nearly a full percentage point year over year to 5% in the third quarter. The average asking rent increased by 2.5% year over year to $22.55 per square foot in the third quarter.The absorption of 14.3 million square feet in the third quarter was less than half the level a year ago, but it was 8% higher than the third-quarter 2019 level. Also, new deliveries aggregated 25.1 million square feet over the past 12 months and marked a record low, per the CBRE Group report.Federal Realty is anticipated to have benefited from the recovery in the retail real estate market. The company has a portfolio of premium retail assets, mainly situated in major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. FRT strategically selected the first-ring suburbs of major metropolitan markets.Due to strong demographics and the infill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy level over the years. Also, a focus on essential retail and mixed-use assets augurs well and ensures steady rental revenue generation.Therefore, with widespread vaccination, the resumption of the economy and decent consumer spending, this retail REIT is anticipated to have benefited from its superior assets in premium locations and witnessed an improvement in the leasing environment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $262.52 million, calling for a 6.2% increase from the year-ago period. The consensus mark for rental revenues is pegged at $261.16 million, suggesting a rise from the year-ago period’s $247.02 million.Rental income from minimum rents — commercial — is presently pegged at $175.11 million, up from $169.50 in the year-ago period. Rental income from cost reimbursements is projected at $48.20 million, up from $43.26 million in the prior-year period.Federal Realty’s activities during the soon-to-be-reported quarter were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter FFO per share has been revised a cent upward to $1.54 in the past two months. It also suggests 1.99% growth year over year.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for FRT this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an FFO beat. However, that’s not the case here.Federal Realty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.65%.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now. As the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic in the second half of 2020, the metals and mining sector was a beneficiary of the rising prices. Demand for most metals heightened as pent-up consumer spending came into play, and government efforts to stimulate the economy and the global energy transition also helped the metals and mining industry. Although S&amp;P Global expects metals prices to slip slightly in 2022 from their record highs, medium-term supply shortages are making way for historically above-average prices through 2025. These elevated prices will be supported by accelerated demand for materials used in the energy transition worldwide.The global mining market is forecasted to grow from $1843.33 billion in 2021 to $2064.72 billion in 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.0%. The mining market is expected to reach $3358.82 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 12.9%. The mining market comprises minerals, precious metals, and materials such as sand, gravel, coal, and stone. Asia Pacific was the largest region in the mining market in 2021, followed by North America. Remote operations and commissioning, health and safety, collaboration, and decarbonization are the key trends to watch in the mining and minerals space in the future. The industry is also relying on the latest technology including artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and data analytics to advance visualization of the production cycle, optimize throughput, lower downtime, and reduce carbon footprint.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and dividend investing, you can go directly to our article This Is the Best Time to Buy These 5 Long-Term Dividend Stocks.For the long-term, tax-paying investor, strategic investment policies focusing on passive income are the ones that work the best. Investment portfolios including reliable dividend stocks have the potential to deliver strong long-term returns even if the market is unfavorable to most stocks. In addition, the fact that a company is able to consistently pay a dividend, while also raising its payouts year after year, is generally a sign that the company has stronger balance sheets and profitability relative to non-dividend-paying companies.As a result of the above, stable dividend stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have typically been among the few securities investors never grow tired of. This is because dividends account for over 40% of a company's total return. This has been an observable trend over more than 90 years until 2015, according to a Morgan Stanley publication on dividend investing. These stocks have also historically outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts. From 1991 to 2015, dividend stocks outperformed non-dividend-payers, since the former had an average annual return of 9.7% while the latter's average annual return was 4.18%. Additionally, those stocks which consistently raise their yields annually also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 benchmark in 17 out of the 23 years between 1991 and 2015.A BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund report from this April also showed that in 2022, dividend stocks comprising this fund outperformed the broad S&amp;P 500 over the 12-month period that ended April 30. Additionally, according to a Barron's article published this May, between 1999 and 2019, dividend-payers with higher payout ratios had an annual return of 10.9%, compared to a 6.6% annual return for those companies with low payout ratios.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on UnsplashMethodologyWe picked strong dividend stocks that also have long-term growth potential.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Dividend Yield as of November 1: 2.55%Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is another consumer staples company on our list, operating through its Oral, Personal and Home Care, and Pet Nutrition segments. The company offers products such as toothpaste, mouthwash, bar, and liquid hand soaps, and more.

Third Point Investors acquired a large position in  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in October, stating that the company is defensive and had significant pricing power in inflationary conditions.

Overall, 50 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $2.6 billion.Third Point, a New York-based investment advisor, mentioned  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

You can skip our detailed analysis of safe stocks, and go directly to read 5 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Recent selloffs have devastated several equities, and investors are still divided on whether the market has reached oversold territory. Some predict a recession and blame it on the Federal Reserve's (Fed) upcoming interest rate increases, while others blame the gigantic valuations of major tech companies. Whatever it may be, the stock market is presently quite volatile. Uncertainty levels are at an all-time high as the Fed fights against inflation and a weakening economy. The Fed cannot deploy quantitative easing to boost the economy, unlike in 2008 and 2020. Inflation will only get worse if this is done.However, just because there is uncertainty in the stock market doesn't mean investors should stay out. Contrarily, historically speaking, bear markets have been a great investment opportunity. Additionally, investors have choices on how to put their money to work. Buy safe investments to weather the short-term storm and steadily increase your wealth over time if you don't have the stomach for more volatility or danger.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:We turn to the smart money to see how they are playing the current turmoil. For this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 895 hedge funds and picked some of the safest stocks these funds were piling into as of the end of June. These are safe, blue-chip companies. Some of them have long-term growth potential while others pay consistent dividend income without any uncertainty. Some of the notable names in the list include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), among others.Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 55Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) specializes in producing and distributing healthcare, household, and personal care products. On October 17, Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers lowered his price target on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to $85 from $87 but kept a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst anticipates Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to release a ""solid set"" of third-quarter financial results, with persistent pressure on gross margins offset by robust organic growth evenly distributed across all regional divisions including its per food segment Hill's.Story continuesThe company was a popular stock among elite funds in Q2 2022, as 55 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the stock, up from 50 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of nearly $3 billion.According to CNBC, Third Point's Loeb sees unrecognized value in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) Hill business. Here is what Third Point specifically said about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 60The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage manufacturer with a brand portfolio of 200 brands of soft drinks, coffee, teas, and water across more than 200 countries and regions. Berkshire Hathaway’s holding of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) remained unchanged during the second quarter of 2022, and the fund had an investment value of approximately $25 billion in the company at the end of Q2 2022. The fund is the leading shareholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) out of the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey during Q2.Given the relatively stable demand for its products, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shares are up 0.39% year to date and the company remains very profitable despite the economic headwinds. It released its latest quarter results on October 25, reporting an EPS of $0.69, beating estimates by $0.05, and revenue of $11.10 billion, beating the estimates by $602.57 million.On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom raised his price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $68 from $63 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst's research note to investors, the company's Q3 earnings performance was ""impressive"" since organic growth more than offset further currency challenges. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) risk/reward ratio appears positive, says Grom, given that its shares have recently underperformed and there is a possibility for better revenue growth to support a prolonged premium compared to its competitors.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion.Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”09. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 61Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American manufacturer of healthcare products worldwide. It operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 61 hedge funds held stakes worth $3.60 billion in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 68 funds in the earlier quarter worth $4 billion. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is a significant company shareholder, with 5.8 million shares worth $639.5 million.Diamond Hill Capital discussed Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”08. PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 65PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is an American multinational manufacturer and distributor of beverages and convenience foods worldwide. PepsiCo, Inc.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”06.

(NASDAQ:REGN) By 29%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-130027483.html,1667394027,STORY,['REGN'],"[Does the November share price for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.76bUS$5.01bUS$5.21bUS$5.30bUS$5.39bUS$5.49bUS$5.59bUS$5.70bUS$5.81bUS$5.92bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x4Est @ 1.72%Est @ 1.79%Est @ 1.85%Est @ 1.89%Est @ 1.92%Est @ 1.94% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$4.5kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$39bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$138bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$138b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$75bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$114b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$760, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.850. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, we've put together three important aspects you should consider:Risks: For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  that you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does REGN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Preventive health care for children is critical to address physical, mental, and emotional conditions and essential for providing routine vaccinations, tracking developmental milestones, treating identified health concerns, and providing support to families. According to a recent Public Health Report, missed visits among children under 5 years old were more common among lower-income, Black, and Latinx households than among higher-income and White households. The program's English and Spanish-language resources are designed to connect and support parents and healthcare providers as partners in children's care.New research conducted by Sesame Workshop indicates a need for active and supportive ""healthy teams"" to promote young children's well-being-a circle of care that includes parents, culturally-competent healthcare providers, and other caring adults. The initiative aims to reduce disparities by highlighting the unique strengths of each family and community; developing a common language around health and wellness and providing easy-to-understand resources; and fostering strong partnerships between families, healthcare providers, and other trusted individuals so that they can work together to make informed health-related decisions for each child.""Sesame Workshop and Quest can promote positive outcomes for children and affirm families' health and well-being by supporting equitable, culturally-competent practices,"" said Jeanette Betancourt, Sesame Workshop's Senior Vice President of U.S. Social Impact. ""Together, we're creating strategies and messages around preventive and everyday healthy practices, building health literacy, and addressing the increase in children's food insecurity to reduce health inequities by empowering parents, caregivers, and the providers who serve them.""Story continuesQuest is teaming up with Sesame Workshop as part of Quest for Health Equity (Q4HE), a multi-year program focused on providing a combination of donated testing services, education programs, and funding to support initiatives working to close the gap in healthcare disparities in underserved communities across the U.S.""We are excited to support the launch of this important program to help reduce health inequities,"" said Ruth Clements, Vice President and General Manager of Infectious Diseases and Immunology at Quest Diagnostics and leader of Quest for Health Equity.

He will remain on as executive chairman until March 2023.Rusckowski said the decision, which will apply to all 60,000 employees, was made after consulting a physician with a health insurance background.""We started step by step to see what we could do ourselves to bend the cost curve,"" he said.Cars line up outside the Central Outreach Wellness Center on the Northside of Pittsburgh, Monday, March 16, 2020, for drive-by testing for COVID-19. The testing, that is limited to 100 kits at present, is being done in partnership with Quest Diagnostics, one of the commercial laboratory companies that have offered COVID-19 tests to dramatically increase the nation's capability. Central Outreach Medical Director Dr. Stacy Lane said the drive-by testing is being used to not contaminate waiting rooms. The testing is based on screening questions for symptoms of dry cough or fever, Central Outreach said. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)Industry impactWhile he is stepping down amid the third year of the pandemic, Rusckowski said the company is still primed and ready to ramp up if case levels rise again.Testing accounts for a low percentage of the overall health care costs in the country, but accounts for a significant portion of decision-making, Rusckowski said. At no time has that been clearer than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when a test was the key to confirming the level of cases.""We're not closing down that capacity, but we're prepared in the event that it comes back up,"" he said.The company now has the ability to process 300,000 PCR tests per day, across all labs in the U.S. And even as experts warn of a tough few months entering into winter, with concerning variants circulating globally, the current situation is vastly different than it's been over the course of the pandemic.Story continues""We've been at a fraction of that for the last several weeks. We actually have seen the testing volume ... come down,"" Rusckowski said.Even so, the testing levels are still substantial compared to pre-pandemic norms. ""We thought it would be capped within the year (2020), but it extended itself into '21, and we continue to have substantial testing,"" Rusckwoski said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

""You see excess inventory levels at retailers like Old Navy, like Kohl's, where the consumer is just a bit tighter.""An inflatable snowman and candy canes are part of the decorations that adorn houses in Brooklyn's Dyker Heights neighborhood, Tuesday, Dec. 22, 2020 in New York. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)Hutchinson sees a far better holiday season for off-price retailers such as TJX Companies (TJX), Burlington Stores (BURL), and Ross Stores (ROST).These discount stores ""will be getting a tremendous amount of high quality, well-branded inventory really starting this quarter,"" Hutchinson said.Overall, the retail industry is entering the peak holiday season in a state of angst.Profit margins are under siege due to discounting intended to move inventory that didn't sell over the summer. And even with heavy promotions, inventory levels remain uncomfortably high, as indicated in the chart below.Too much inventory!Meanwhile, consumers are balking at price increases for apparel and accessories, and labor costs to staff stores are on the rise.Against this backdrop, the VanEck Retail ETF (RTH) is up more than 3% in the past month, beating the slight drop in the Dow Jones Industrial average.However, Hutchinson said most retail companies will issue conservative guidance when they report third-quarter earnings over the next few weeks. That could lead to fresh selling pressure in the space.""We think they'll issue cautious outlooks for 4Q,"" Hutchinson added. ""Some of it is because they brought in inventory too early. The shelves were bare last year, but a part of it is they were forecasting demand that didn't materialize.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

HarperNow that the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge 2022 winners have been officially announced, you'll want to learn more about each winning team and the story behind each innovation. The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is an online competition that awards cash prizes to early-stage tech entrepreneurs solving the world's toughest problems. Since 2017, the competition has awarded $3.25 million USD to 78 start-ups from 25 countries.We are excited for you to learn more about the 2022 winning teams addressing some of the biggest challenges we face through technology-based solutions.Three dynamic startups - WonderTree, Positive Carbon, and M-SCAN - were each awarded a Second Runner-Up Prize of $50,000 USD. I recently had the pleasure of interviewing members from each team to learn more about their innovative solutions and technologies.WonderTreeIn Pakistan, there are only 550 institutions to serve over 1.5 million children with special needs. Inspired by an older brother with learning disabilities, CTO Muhammad Usman co-founded WonderTree as a developmental platform to benefit these underserved children. The technology incorporates augmented reality to transform physiotherapy, education, and cognitive development exercises into fun, interactive games played online on a laptop computer without the need for skilled operators or special facilities, helping young users develop to their full potential.In the following Q&amp;A, CEO and co-founder Muhammad Waqas shares his insights on how WonderTree's games have successfully made learning cost-effective and accessible.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue?Muhammad: There are two main ways we provide children with special needs access to education and development.By leveraging technology, we make their physiotherapy, and educational and cognitive development, more accessible and affordable because our solution doesn't require a physiotherapist at a special facility using specialized equipment; with just a laptop and an internet connection, the child can perform the exercises. This makes our solution more than 80 percent cheaper than conventional methods, as well as scalable and more readily available.Story continuesSecond, by gamifying conventional, boring, and painful physiotherapy and educational exercises, we make them fun and engaging through augmented reality. This way, children can look forward to playing the games while their skills develop, putting smiles on their faces every time! This is a big motivation for the entire team to keep doing what we are doing.What sets your solution apart?Muhammad: First, it's a personal cause. WonderTree is Usman's brainchild, and he leads the entire game and technology development. His experience of having an older brother with disabilities adds a touch of care, love, and consideration for the child and their family. We are not just making any product; we are developing something that can change the lives of children with special needs and help their families.Second, we have an amazing, crazy, and dynamic team of psychologists, game designers, developers, and artificial intelligence experts, all believing in the cause. The synergy created by this dynamic and talented team has taken WonderTree this far.Finally, technological innovation using augmented reality turns conventional physiotherapy and educational exercises into games. We also use artificial intelligence to detect and track each child, and to top it off we do all of this online over a web browser on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms. This makes our solution highly effective, accessible, and affordable.Positive CarbonGlobally, one-third of food produced annually - a staggering 1.3 billion tons - is wasted, costing over $1 trillion USD and contributing to 10 percent of greenhouse emissions. Meet Positive Carbon, based in Ireland, whose sensors alert commercial kitchens to which foods and how much of them they are wasting while providing solutions to cut waste by 50 percent.Aisling Kirwan, Co-Founder and Director of Operations, briefed me on what sets their technology and sensors apart.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue?Aisling: We help customers increase their profits and make their operations sustainable as they reduce their food waste with a monitoring solution designed to register total waste across all location sites, from low-volume cafes to high-volume workplace campuses.Our patented food waste sensor uses the same technology as self-driving cars to create a 3-D map of the inside of the bin by using a LiDAR (light detection and ranging) laser. By applying algorithms and our database of thousands of food densities, our technology can calculate the weight of each piece of food thrown in the bin.What sets your solution apart?Aisling: No other food waste monitoring company offers a fully automated system such as ours. The food waste sensor identifies the volume and weight of food waste while a camera captures an image of the food and uploads it to the cloud for artificial intelligence (AI) identification. This process is entirely automatic and requires zero kitchen staff interaction, so critically there's no interference to their routine.M-SCANUganda-based M-SCAN was founded by Menyo Innocent, Team Lead &amp; Co-Founder, to address a tragic statistic: On average, 16 Ugandan mothers a day die from maternal health complications because they lacked access to prenatal screening.Traditional ultrasound equipment is prohibitively expensive for most Ugandan clinics. As an alternative, M-SCAN developed a portable and affordable ultrasound scanning device, tailored for use in sub-Saharan African countries like Uganda, that connects to laptop computers and mobile devices for readout.To cast a light on how their devices are saving lives, Menyo elaborated on what makes their technology unique.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue?Menyo: M-SCAN probes are affordable, highly portable, and power-efficient devices that connect to laptops, tablets, and mobile phones to offer ultrasound scanning. In contrast, traditional machines are large, bulky, power consuming, and costly, especially for rural, low-resource clinics, which have the most need for cost-effective scanning.What sets your solution apart?Menyo: Medics with expertise in sonography (ultrasound) and human-centered technology designed the M-SCAN device to connect to mobile computing platforms with just a USB on-the-go cable.We are currently leveraging data from previous scans to develop an AI algorithm that improves over time to predict future medical complications.To learn more about all three teams, be sure to watch the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge 2022 Second Runner-Up Prize winners video.Stay tuned for more articles in our blog series, featuring interviews with every Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge 2022 winning team.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/723293/How-Three-Dynamic-Startups-Are-Changing-the-World]"
520,7180fb07-5cd3-3e3c-a14f-5b7078b7e4a3,CSCO,2022-11-02,Is Cisco Systems (CSCO) a Suitable Stock for Value Investors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-csco-suitable-stock-133001965.html,1667309401,STORY,"['CSCO', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Cisco Systems has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.04, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 17.88. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Cisco Systems’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.62. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that Cisco Systems has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.93, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Cisco Systems stock in the near term too.Story continuesP/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Cisco Systems has a P/S ratio of about 3.65. This is a bit higher than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.56 right now. Nevertheless, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, CSCO is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Cisco Systems currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Cisco Systems a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 13.01, which is better than the industry average of 15.97. Clearly, CSCO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Cisco Systems might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives CSCO a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have not been very encouraging. The current fiscal quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen zero estimate revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter and fiscal full year consensus estimate has been unchanged in the past two months. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and ConsensusCisco Systems, Inc. Price and ConsensusCisco Systems, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat unfavorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCisco Systems is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 10% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
