The fund does not have a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, though we have been able to explore other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.', 'Objective', 'SFILX is classified in the Non US - Equity area by Zacks, and this segment is full of potential. Non US - Equity funds focus their investments on companies outside of the United States, which is an important distinction since global mutual funds tend to keep a sizable portion of their portfolio based in the United States. Most of these funds will allocate across emerging and developed markets, and can often extend across cap levels too.', 'History of Fund/Manager', ""SFILX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index debuted in January of 2008. Since then, SFILX has accumulated assets of about $600.11 million, according to the most recently available information. The fund's current manager, David Rios, has been in charge of the fund since April of 2017."", 'Performance', 'Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 6.61%, and is in the bottom third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 2.32%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SFILX's standard deviation comes in at 17.65%, compared to the category average of 17.93%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 19.85% compared to the category average of 21.73%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""The fund has a 5-year beta of 0.94, so investors should note that it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -6.88. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Expenses', 'Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, SFILX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.39% compared to the category average of 0.94%. From a cost perspective, SFILX is actually cheaper than its peers.', 'Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $0 and that each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'For additional information on the Non US - Equity area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

In fact, efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter for gauging its potential to make profits.', 'However, at times it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks.', 'These efficiency ratios are:', 'Receivables Turnover: This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.', 'Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.', 'Inventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.', 'Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.', 'In addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) — to the screen to make this strategy more profitable.

Welcome to Unum Group's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Today, we will be discussing full year 2023 results, along with highlights from the fourth quarter. We will also use the time to discuss our outlook for 2024. Please note that today's call may include forward-looking statements.

Following the remarks from Rick and Steve, additional members of management will participate in Q&A, including Mark Till, who heads our Unum International business; Tim Arnold, who heads our Colonial Life and Voluntary Benefits lines and Chris Pyne for Group Benefits. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."", 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""Great. Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you all today, sharing the journey of Unum throughout 2023 and where we're headed in 2024. This is the first time we've shared our outlook in conjunction with our year-end results, and I think it works well, given the consistency of our actions and performance across the company. As we reflect on our progress and look ahead, I am proud to affirm our unwavering commitment to our purpose of helping the working world thrive throughout life's moments. Steadfast focus and commitment to this purpose is delivering value to customers, employees, communities and, of course, to shareholders. 2023 was a year of exceptional results across the board, with a highlight being our decades-long leadership in disability insurance shining through, and core business growth momentum building stronger with significant strides in accelerating our industry-leading digital capabilities. The capabilities we are bringing to market, such as HR Connect, Total Leave, Gather and Help@Hand are becoming connection points with employers and employees, to bring greater customer satisfaction to the benefits experience. These advancements have been influential in attracting and retaining customers, setting us apart in a competitive landscape, and ultimately driving strong top line results, including sales of over 13% for the full year of 2023 and premium growth of over 5%. This top line growth has returned steadily throughout the year and has us on the trajectory that we look for in our business model. As the top line has returned in 2023, our discipline with how we run the business has not wavered. Our pricing and underwriting has remained consistent to continue to deliver growth and high returns on equity. Overall, we grew EPS 23%, with most of our product lines delivering on our expectations throughout the year. I mentioned the highlight of group disability returns, but I would extend that to most of our products and continue to -- that continue to generate mid- to high-teen returns. An area that understandably received attention in the third quarter was our Closed Block. We have seen volatility in the performance of that block. And today, Steve will provide some ways to look at its overall health and performance outside of just its loss ratio. From a capital standpoint, we've executed our plans exactly how we describe them coming into the year, and with good results. So we exceeded expectations on value delivered to our shareholders. We raised our dividend by 10% and increased the pace of our share repurchases throughout 2023 and announced a plan to double the amount we repurchased in 2024 with our $500 million authorization. Most notably, we described a desire to fully fund the premium deserve -- premium efficiency reserve and contribute the capital needed to support our long-term care block. Steve will discuss further, but let me emphasize -- given our current assumptions and capital buffers, we have stated that we believe long-term care will not need additional capital for 5 years. But in reality, our belief is that will be true for much longer. Across the company, the reason that we have been able to achieve such capital results goes back to the fact that our businesses steadily generate strong cash flow. And with a year of good results, we ended the year with financial metrics that were stronger than expected, including holding company cash of $1.7 billion and RBC of 415%. Looking forward, we now expect to generate free cash flow between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion per year. As we transition to think about 2024, the momentum from the past several years continues. We're witnessing both a market backdrop and economic environment that are highly supportive of our business, providing us with ample opportunities to grow and thrive. Our focus is to continue building on our solid foundation. We're dedicated to enhancing our core operations, maintaining our disciplined approach and continuing to innovate in ways that resonate with our customers and the market. When we look across the company, we are hitting the ground running, and our teams are looking to build on some very strong growth rates with consolidated sales growth of high single digits and combined with good persistency, yielding premium growth in the 5% to 7% range. Consistent margins and the purchasing of shares will deliver growth of 7% and 9% on top of the 23% adjusted EPS growth we delivered in 2023. Our customer-centric approach remains at the heart of our strategy. We're constantly adapting our services to meet changing market needs, ensuring we remain the preferred choice for our clients. When we met last February, we outlined our strategy and plans to build on our market-leading position. We can report that we are advancing along all fronts, and we are seeing the results. For Unum in the U.S., we are leveraging our go-to-market expertise to connect benefit solutions to HR platforms effectively, while also ensuring our leave management is a differentiator. With over 1,500 customers and counting, we've reached a notable sales milestones with our HR Connect capability, which deeply integrates with leading human capital management platforms and we now cover over 1 million employees through Unum's Total Leave offering. In addition, we saw strong momentum in the trend of customers bundling products. Our efforts are geared towards seamless enrollment, billing and administration via My Unum and establishing robust connections with select third-party platforms. These efforts to leverage technology to improve the customer experience are paying off. And in 2023, we saw record levels of employer satisfaction for customers on the My Unum platform. In Colonial Life, the focus is on continuing to build and support our independent sales force with enhanced tools and solutions, such as our proprietary industry-leading Agent Assist technology, which enables automated lead generations, CRM and workflow, boosting agent productivity. Another key development in our arsenal is Gather, which modernizes enrollment and benefits administration and streamlines the client experience. The offering has been building, is evidenced by the annual premium associated with it, increasing from $10 million to $50 million over the course of 2023. And finally, enabling Colonial Life agents to offer Unum employer-paid products ensures they have the solution for any employer or broker. For Unum UK, our approach has been to redefine the broker experience, setting a market-leading standard that is distinctively Unum and enhancing our relationship management model. We are dedicated to providing value-added services that drive customer engagement and loyalty, such as through Help@Hand, which offers integrated value-added services and by delivering comprehensive management information that yields actionable insights. Moreover, we're expanding our product set to encompass a broader spectrum of risk and well-being solutions, ensuring we meet the diverse needs of our clients. And finally, in Unum Poland, we're forging ahead with a robust strategy tailored to the local market. We're scaling our direct to SME sales team and fortifying partnerships with local brokers, thereby extending our distribution network and geographical reach. All these efforts will drive growth in the number of employers and customers we serve and in turn, will be -- will generate the growth of premiums and earnings we have articulated. Looking forward, we will also remain disciplined stewards of our capital and franchise value, and the consistency of our capital priorities remains intact. First, we ensure investments directly supporting our business. We have a clear growth strategy continued to build out our offerings and capitalize on our well-positioned and profitable products. Second, we will look externally to identify and pursue selective M&A that supports our internal initiatives and that are in line with this strategy. And third, we will continue to return capital to shareholders via regular dividend increases and share repurchases, as we have demonstrated through our actions and increasing both commensurate with our plans. Summing it up, our strong capital generation, $500 million of share repurchases and no LTC contributions will leave us in a position of greater than 400% RBC and holding company cash greater than $2 billion. For 2024, our commitment to innovation, prudent capital allocation and shareholder returns remain steadfast. As a result, we are on track to surpass the objectives we established a year ago, and our fortified position in the market is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our teams across the globe. The strides we've made in our digital footprint, customer engagement and capital management are the very engines of our growth. In closing, we entered 2024 with confidence in our position and ready to build off of our achievements of 2023. With our customer-first mindset, agile operations and comprehensive financial strategies, we are not just anticipating the future, we are actively shaping it. 2024 is going to be an exciting year for Unum. I'd like to now hand it over to Steve to provide further insights into our financial strategy and outlook as well as provide insight into the Closed Block. Thanks for your attention once again today. And Steve, I'll turn it over to you."", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Great. Thanks, Rick, and good morning to everyone. As Rick mentioned, we were extremely pleased with the strong finish to the year across the board. This caps 2 years of continued momentum building in our core operating segments. This is evident in both our sales and operating results. For the full year, sales were up 15.1% in Unum U.S., 26.7% in Unum International and 6.2% in Colonial Life, where we saw accelerating growth each quarter, including 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year ago. Premium for our core operations increased 6.1% in the quarter compared to a year ago and finished up 5.2% for the full year, exceeding the expectation laid out last February and more consistent with our long-term expectation. Disability results were favorable across the company as well, highlighted by a group disability benefit ratio of 59.1% for the full year and 59.5% in the quarter. We do expect benefit ratios in the low 60s to continue in the near to midterm, as we continue to see support for these levels in both our operations and in the market. These same trends are also supporting strong performance in our individual disability and U.K. Group Income Protection product lines. We ended the year with after-tax adjusted operating income at $1.5 billion and after-tax adjusted operating EPS of $7.66, which represents growth of 23.3% over historically reported full year 2022. The fourth quarter's results of reported after-tax adjusted operating EPS of $1.79 was impacted by 2 items that I would like to mention. First, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was elevated at 22.8%. We expect the long-term rate to be between 21.1% and 22% -- or 21.5% to 22% and vary some from period to period due to foreign tax dynamics. The variance in the fourth quarter lowered EPS by approximately $0.03. Further, Colonial Life Benefits were higher by $21.7 million or $0.09 of EPS pressure, due to a onetime reserve model refinement. When adjusting for these 2 items, which represents a better view of underlying earnings power, adjusted operating EPS in the quarter would have been $0.12 higher. The strong earnings power for GAAP was also apparent in our statutory results, with full year after-tax operating earnings of over $1.3 billion, well ahead of our outlook last year of roughly $1 billion. These results drove significant upside to our original expectation of capital generation and as a result, our capital position. Top line results were also notable this year, with both sales and premium for our core operations outperforming the top end of their outlook ranges at 13.4% and 5.2% respectively. Fourth quarter's results also show that momentum isn't slowing, which we believe will set us up nicely for continued growth in 2024. These strong growth metrics are a testament to the value of our offering in the market and the success we are seeing with our key strategic initiatives that Rick discussed. Investing in these capabilities to grow our core business is a key capital priority. And as a result, the full year 2023 adjusted operating expense ratio increased to 21.7%, slightly above our expectations coming into the year. We continue to expect the expense ratio to taper off over time, as the impact of our investments take further hold. For full year 2024, we expect our adjusted operating expense ratio to be slightly lower than 2023. Now let me briefly review our 2023 results by segment. For Unum US, adjusted operating income increased 39.4% to $1.36 -- to $1.36 billion in 2023 compared to $972.6 million in 2022. As mentioned earlier, these results were bolstered by disability performance, with group disability experiencing full year adjusted operating earnings growth of 56.1% in our individual disability line of business, driving overall supplemental and voluntary growth of 11.7% for the year. Further, group disability ended the year with an ROE of [30.88%]. The group life and AD&D lines experienced adjusted operating earnings growth of 94.8%, as the impacts from the pandemic waned. The fourth quarter's results of $68 million were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic and were driven by favorable labor experience, lower incidents in AD&D, with continued lower mortality results. From a growth perspective, Unum US earned premium grew 5.2% to $6.6 billion due to natural growth, higher sales and solid persistency. This result was in line with our expected premium growth rate of 4% to 6%. Now moving to Unum International. The segment continued to show strong trends in its underlying earnings power, with adjusted operating income of $158.1 million for the year, up 18% compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter U.K. results were in line with our outlook for adjusted operating earnings levels in the mid-20 million pound range, excluding the impacts of inflation. Inflation has moderated since last year's highs, and we expect this will continue as the environment normalizes, but still benefited the U.K. this quarter by approximately GBP 5 million. We are extremely pleased with the growth levels in the U.K., highlighted by full year sales growth of 18.6% and premium growth of 11.6%, well ahead of our original expectations of 2% to 5% and 2% to 4%, respectively. While the U.K. business is a major driver of this segment, Poland saw significant levels of growth, increasing sales, 76% and premium 24.2% for the year. Now turning to Colonial. The segment saw growth return after a couple of years of challenged results, due to the impacts of the pandemic on our sales process and agent productivity. Sales growth of 6.2% and premium growth of 1.4% for the full year, does drive optimism for the further growth in 2024 and our ultimate target to return to the high single-digit level of growth that this segment historically achieved. From an adjusted earnings perspective, full year results of $400.1 million were lower than $412.9 million a year ago, largely due to a number of unique items throughout the year, including the reserve model refinement in 4Q. That said, full year ROE was impressive at 18.1%, and we expect a high level of earnings power from this line as we enter 2024. Switching gears to the Closed Block of business and focusing on this quarter, adjusted operating earnings of $21.3 million were below our expected run rate of $30 million to $40 million and last quarter's results of $34.2 million, as both long-term care and the remainder of our closed disability block saw sequential declines. The net premium ratio, which is indicative of the lifetime benefit ratio expectation, increased slightly to 93.5%, from 93.4% in the third quarter of 2023. Under LDTI, the combination of earnings results and movements in the net premium ratio provides a more comprehensive view of long-term care claims performance compared to the previously reported interest-adjusted loss ratio, which we observed could distort underlying claims experience trends and focus solely on experience in that quarter. Overall, underlying claims experience for the block was largely in line with third quarter. Incidents remained above long-term expected levels, but has improved from the higher levels seen earlier in 2023. We continue to believe that the elevated incidence rates in 2023 were a function of inventory levels normalizing in the environment following the pandemic. We expect to see a continuation of claims catch-up in 2024, albeit at a dissipating rate. Lastly, for the Closed Block, our alternative investment portfolio, which largely backs LTC, produced income of $21.5 million in the quarter. Since inception, our diversified alternative portfolio has produced returns in line with our long-term expectation of 8% to 10%. Rounding up the segments, the Corporate segment produced a loss of $36.5 million in the quarter, and we expect this level of loss to continue at slightly higher levels in 2024. So then stepping back, 2023 was an incredible year for the company, and as we turn to 2024, we see many of the same tailwinds and opportunities to win. So with all that considered, it's time to talk about our outlook for this year, and I'll start with our view of business growth and earnings power, discuss how that plays in the capital generation. And then I'll end with a little bit of a discussion on how we're executing on our strategy for long-term care. So just to orient everyone on the slides and make sure that we're following along, we're on Page 7. And I want to kick off this discussion. I really reflect back to a year ago at our last outlook meeting and in summary, we have delivered what we described last February when we were in New York City and are poised to deliver even stronger performance in 2024. We led off that discussion with a key message, and that message was that we have the ability and capacity to chart our course in 2023. And I believe that is even more true as we go into 2024. So 4 key messages for the outlook discussion. Number one is top line growth. It is very strong, and it's fueled by momentum and the digital capabilities that Rick mentioned. Number two, the earning growth rates really stabilizing back to our long-term expected range after 2 years of very high levels of growth, coming out of the pandemic and specifically some highlights that I'd like to note. First, group disability is back to prepandemic incidence rates, with historically favorable levels of recovery. The second thing to note is group life is back to pre-pandemic levels of earnings. Third, we have a full recovery of our U.K. business model, with double-digit growth rates. And lastly, momentum continuing to build in Colonial Life and the franchise that we have there. The third message for the outlook is we're at an inflection point in free cash flow. And that's due to no contributions needed for long-term care in 2024, which will allow us to return more capital to shareholders while maintaining significant capital buffers. And I would end with the key message of our capital generation is really at full strength, with all capital metrics well in excess of targets. So then I'll move on to Page 8, and I just want to briefly hit on some highlights for top line expectations. We have healthy core businesses, which will deliver strong levels of growth in 2024. But I want to reflect a little bit that we just came off a really good growth story in 2023. And in Unum US, sales grew 15%, with premium growing over 5%. In International, sales grew close to 30%, premium growing over 14% and in Colonial, sales growing at 6.2%, with premium close to 1.5% growth. And then I would say to top this all off, we have maintained industry-leading margins. Our secret sauce is really to grow in a disciplined way that is sustainable and leads ultimately to earnings growth and capital generation for future growth and deployment to our shareholders. Moving on to Page 9, talk a little bit more about earnings growth. So the top of the house view here is with most of our 2024 metrics, they are in or relatively in line with our long-term expectations. Long-term expectations for sales increased as we see the benefits of our investments in technology. We have strong projected earnings growth, despite record levels of earnings power in 2023. It really shows the strength of the franchise. But what I'm most optimistic about is our premium growth story, as we believe the growth rates of our core businesses can surpass the growth we saw in 2023, which was still a year of recovery in some ways. Then transitioning to Page 10, talk a little bit about our sources and uses of capital. And I'll orient you on the left side of the page around capital generation and really start with statutory earnings. Similar to the GAAP earnings that we just discussed, U.S. statutory earnings are also projected to be robust. And -- but the one thing, just to remind the audience of, is that these earnings will be available for dividends up to the holding company in the following year or 2025. But 2023 statutory earnings of over $1.3 billion are available to us this year in 2024. I move next to international dividends. Given the recent performance in the U.K., they are now able to contribute their fair share of earnings through dividends to the holding company. Next, our service agreements. Those are mainly through investment management agreements, and they continue to be a strong source of free cash flow to the holding company. And so our capital generation capacity remains strong and in line with our 2023 actuals, but well above last year's outlook. So considering our interest expense expectation of $200 million, our free cash flow generation is a healthy $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, as we move past the period of capital contributions being needed for LTC. So then we arrive at capital deployment back to our shareholders, and that is also increasing significantly, with an expected increase in the dividend of 10% to 15%, which we will discuss with our Board later this spring and announce in the coming months. And doubling the amount of dollars spent on share repurchase, consistent with the authorization we received at the end of last year. I would note that these repurchases in 2024 may not be straight line throughout the year, if we do see opportunities in the market to maximize this authorization throughout the year. And then our use of excess capital generated will follow our capital priorities, grow core businesses, either through organic investment or inorganically, shareholder dividends and then share repurchase. So then moving on to Slide 11, talk a little bit about capital targets. I'm not going to spend too much time here, as you will see consistency in our targets and our company performance. 2023 saw capital levels well in excess of our targets and 2024 projections to be similar, providing us substantial financial flexibility. I will add that these levels of flexibility are supportive of our goal of maintaining a single A financial rating. We continue to make progress on that front in 2023 with our upgrade by Fitch towards the end of last year. Okay. Let's move on to a few topics regarding long-term care, and I will move to Page 13. So to recap our strategy, we have a focused strategy for managing the Closed Block, which we have progressed and continued to progress, and is focused on 3 things: creating value, reducing the footprint and increasing predictability of outcomes. In line with this strategy, we executed on a number of items, we teed up as priorities with you in early 2023, and we continue to use a number of actions as we enter 2024. We have continued to mitigate interest rate risk and have done so at the current favorable interest rate environment. By repositioning cash flows and hedging, we've been able to reduce interest rate sensitivity to date by 25%, and how we measure that is with a basic DV01 measurement, which is really the dollar duration impact to surplus. So think about the sensitivity of our surplus to 100 basis point movement in prevailing interest rates. We continue to pursue justified rate increases. Last year, we achieved over $450 million in GPV of increases and are nearing $4.5 billion of rate increased value since we started our program. And then we are using our strong capital position to create capital capacity and flexibility, providing the ability to navigate adverse events and creating confidence in our go-forward free cash flows. As committed last year, we fully recognized the premium deficiency reserve at year-end. This was an important step in protecting our future cash flows, and we will talk more on this in a moment. And finally, we remain active and we'll continue to look for risk transfer solutions. So then moving on to Page 14. I want to spend a little bit of time talking about our interest rate risk management and I really want to cover 3 topics here. One, discuss where we've been and accomplished over the last year; two, what the benefit of those actions were; and three, how that has helped to mitigate any capital requirements in a downside interest rate scenario. So first of all, I'll talk about hedging and repositioning and how that's allowed us to better match duration and fruit quality and reduce interest sensitivity. So we kicked off our more recent hedging program at the beginning of last year. Since then, we have entered into 2.6 billion of notional treasury forwards, and those do have an average treasury yield of 4%. And as you know, we look out and take a 7-year horizon, and it's really to try to derisk the yields at which we can invest those cash flows as we look to the near to medium term. Secondly, in the third quarter of last year, we executed on a $700 million repositioning program within the LTC portfolio. And the objective of that was really to look at shorter duration assets and derisk the new money rate that we'll be able to invest those on and extend the duration to longer-duration assets. We took the opportunity to do that at a nice place in the interest rate environment. We improved portfolio quality, we increased yield, and we did extend duration with no capital impact. And so the results of that is we were able -- as I mentioned, we were able to improve our duration matching measures by 25%, but we also reduced the PDR in Unum America, the sensitivity to interest rate movements by 30%. And that's really demonstrated then in the chart on the right side of the page. And so let me explain the table on the right quickly. It's really the same concept that we used in our Investor Day materials last year, but I just want to orient you on it. At year-end, the premium deficiency reserve that was recorded was at $1.6 billion. And then the sensitivities that we're showing here are for the 30-year treasury yield and the impact that those would have over time with our new money rate assumption that then is incorporated into our liability discount rate. And so as an example, at a 4% assumption, the $1.6 billion of PDR would be reduced by $1.1 billion, assuming that the 4% assumption worked its way all the way into our 3-year trailing average that we use for that construct. So the dynamic, it really provides flexibility and appropriately manage our LTC commitments. And so I think it's key 2 concepts here. One, we do have time to adapt as those rates work into our assumption. But I think the other thing that's very important, and we have a note on the page, is that our interest rate management actions have significantly dampened any downside risk of interest rate movements on the PDR or balance, and I'll call out the 2% assumption here and highlight the fact that, that sensitivity has been reduced by $450 million because of the actions that we have taken over the last couple of years around both hedging and our repositioning of the portfolio. All right. Then I'll move on to Page 15. And I want to give a little bit more information about both how we think about reserve sufficiency, but also some sensitivities. And so the orientation for this page is we talk about $2.8 billion of protection. What that really represents is our view of our current level of statutory reserves in excess of our view of the best estimate of that liability, for the liability that's within Unum America and reinsured to Fairwind. Plus the excess capital that we have within the Fairwind entity in excess of those targets that we set. Then when you go to the table, those are really sensitivities independent of that protection, where we look at the assumptions built into our best estimate, and we look at the dollar amount impact to our best estimate, given the sensitivities. And so specifically, I would say these are liability assumption sensitivities. We addressed interest rate sensitivities on the previous page. So let me walk you through a little bit the sensitivities themselves. So on the premium rate increase, the $1 billion really represents the full amount of value we have currently in our best estimate assumption. And so the sensitivity is to completely remove that. I would say from my perspective, we have had a great track record over the years to be able to deliver on achieving our premium rate targets. In fact, we've always -- we've already made very good progress in the achievement of that $1 billion, just since we've launched the program back in the fall. Secondly, morbidity and mortality improvement. The assumption within the best estimate reserve is $700 million. And so this sensitivity would be to fully remove that. We do believe, and we've seen over time, improvement in both morbidity and mortality in our experience. So we do believe that, that assumption is backed up by the data and the experience that we've seen, but we've gone ahead just for purposes of the presentation to fully remove that, to give an indication of the size of that assumption. And then we have 3 more assumptions, which are policy lapse and mortality or claiming incidents and our claim resolutions. We've given sensitivities here down 7.5% for the whole of lapses and mortalities, an increase in claim incidents of 3% and a decrease in claim resolutions, mostly due to mortality of 2%. And the way to think about that is those roughly approximate one standard deviation difference over the entire life of the business for these sensitivities, and you can see the resulting impact to our best estimate. The one thing to also remember, though, when it comes to those last 3 assumptions, it's critical to remember that we still do have the ability to increase our rate increase actions, as a form to mitigate those adverse developments and the impact of those additional rate increases are not reflected in these individual liability sensitivities. So then 2 other items to note on this page. First of all, excess capital, as it emerges, which we do think will emerge in Fairwind over time. It can be used to meet LTC needs across all the entities. And the point there is, we do have the ability, over time, to make decisions about how to use that excess capital that, over time, we believe will build in Fairwind. And then the second item to note is given our current position along with the PDR balance dynamics described above, would be expected to meet the capital needs of the book, as it does progress to peak reserves in the next 10 years. So just to reiterate, under our current assumptions and in the current interest rate environment, the actions we have taken, create confidence that future cash flows of the enterprise will be insulated from LTC needs. And then I'll finish off on Page 16. So to close this out, let's discuss some key indicators of long-term health of the business. And we look at 4 metrics. First, the net NPR or Net Premium Ratio. With the shift to LDTI, we believe that MPR provides a long-term outlook for block claim experience, and we will look at the movement in that metric over time. We gave that movement in our comments this quarter, and we'll continue to do that over time. Secondly, Closed Block earnings. While we expect quarterly volatility, we would expect an annualized run rate in the $130 million to $160 million range, in an environment where experience may vary quarter-to-quarter, assuming alternative asset yields are near longer-term ranges. The third metric would be rate increased progress, and this is a key element of our strategy, and we monitor progress against our best estimate assumptions. Recall that we increased the scope of the program with our latest assumption review, and so we'll give information over time, how we're progressing as a percentage against that best estimate assumption within the reserve liability. And then lastly, the 30-year treasury rate. And in particular, we will look for the 3-year average to remain above the 2.84% rate, which represents the current 3-year average. That rate underlines our new money assumption that feeds into our liability discount rate for the premium deficiency reserve. Rates above this would signal a positive impact on the overall discount rate and related balance of the premium deficiency reserve as represented on Page 14 of the stack. So to wrap up, we have very exciting top and bottom line expectations for 2024. We think our financial flexibility has never been stronger, and we look forward to the year ahead. Thank you again for attending today's call, and I look forward to your questions. And now I'll turn the call back over to Rick to close."", 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""Great. Thank you, Steve. As you can see and based on Steve's and my comments, 2024 is shaping up to be a great year for Unum. The teams are very focused on what we want to achieve this year, and continued momentum in our core business and the inflection point we're seeing with capital, now that our LTC block is funded, as Steve articulated, really puts us in a very good spot. So there's plenty of topics to discuss today. So with that, I will -- the team is here to field questions and I'll turn it back to you, Rob."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of [Joel Hurwitz] from (inaudible)and Partners.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""First on the core businesses, if I compare the '24 earnings outlook relative to what you guys guided a year ago, I estimate that core business earnings expectations are over $150 million better than what would have been implied a year ago. I guess do you see this level of core business earnings as a sustainable longer term? Or would you expect to have to give back some of the favorable risk results over time?"", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes, this is Steve. I can take that question. And I'll just maybe get into the math a little bit how we're thinking about expectations going into '24. I think the key to think about with our core businesses, we do believe that we're going to be able to maintain the margins in our group disability business through the next year. And specifically, we believe that the benefit ratio for group disability will remain in that low 60% level. I would also note that we do anticipate an increase in Colonial Life earnings. I did mention we had several onetime items that did dampen the earnings of Colonial Life in 2023. And we think in 2024, that earnings will come through on a more kind of core basis. And then maybe we can hit a little bit on just the commercial environment and competitive environment and just the level of pricing in the group benefits line."", 'Christopher Wallace Pyne', ""Yes. Thanks, Steve. Thanks for the question, Joel. This is Chris. We're really excited about where we stand, and I'd like to start with capabilities. When we're talking to new customers, we're really there to help solve problems. We see many more prospects in the market, who are looking to solve big problems that we address through. Some of the things Rick mentioned with Total Leave and HR Connect and My Unum. That changes the game versus a more traditional price check type environment. So from a new business perspective, we are writing strong levels of business. We expect that to continue, and we're hitting price point. That's a great day. From a renewal perspective, business is favorable. And we look at it very much on a case-by-case basis. We are -- our history of strong risk discipline from an underwriting perspective serves us really well. Again, these customers value what we bring. We're able to show up in these discussions, we have an opportunity to talk about long-term price stability, whether it be modest rate increase, rate pass or rate reduction and our persistency results through the close of '23 were quite strong as we go into '24."", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""I think, Joel, you hit it. There was a step-up in 2023 from an earnings perspective, but you can see from our outlook in 2024, we're looking to grow off it. So 7% to 9% on top of a very strong year. All those indicators that we talked about and as Chris articulated, in particular to our group disability, but even with our Colonial Life business are all intact, and that leads us to our good outlook coming off of an incredibly strong year."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Okay. Helpful. And then in terms of long-term care, I guess, what gives you guys confidence that the experience you've been seeing is more of a catch-up versus a longer-term shift in trends? And then in terms of the outlook, what's embedded in 2024 guidance for Closed Block earnings?"", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes. This is Steve. I can take that one. So related to incidents, I just kind of take people back a little bit on long-term care and where we've been. At the beginning of 2023, we saw very elevated incidents through the first 6 months. We saw that start to abate a little bit in the third quarter, albeit at still elevated levels. Going into the fourth quarter, I would say those incidence levels were pretty consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. But what we also saw during the pandemic were fairly low levels of incidents. And we could just see, when we're looking at just kind of our inventory trend lines that we were a bit below the trend lines that we would ultimately expect. And so as we approach back to those, that gives us some confidence that this was just kind of pent-up demand. The other thing that we've seen a lot of over the last 6 months, I would say, and maybe even a little bit before that, was the higher level of resubmission of claims, and those would be claims that had previously been submitted, but either denied or closed or recovered for other reasons. And we've seen the level of those come back in, which might indicate claims that originally had been pulled back, but now have been submitted. And so obviously, we have to continue to monitor this. We do believe that the level of incidence for a while in '24 will probably continue at an elevated level, but we would look to monitor that then as we get into the back half of the year. And I would say within our outlook, we still do have a level of elevated incidents built into that outlook."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.', 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""First question I had is just on the excess capital position. At the holdco, it got a lot stronger with a big dividend that seems in 4Q and you're projecting it to get better in 2024. So just thought maybe you could give us at high level, what are the priorities there? You've outlined share repurchases, and we know where comp dividends are, it looks like you're at $0.5 billion after that, the sort of not earmarked. So what are the priorities for using that?"", 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""Sure. Thanks, Alex. Just to take you back, everyone back, we mentioned a couple of times, but the capital generation this year was very, very strong. We see it continuing as we go forward. And we ended the year in a very good capital position as we've been building that throughout 2023. So first of all, I'll start there.Second is last year, a priority was putting more money behind long-term care and funding that level of funding up the PDR, and so that was accomplished. And I think that leaves us in a good spot as we've talked about, no more money going towards long-term care. And so then we think about the deployment opportunities we have in 2024, I'd start out first with putting it right back in our core businesses, investing in the digital capabilities we talked about. From an organic perspective, that's contemplated in our earnings as we talk about as we fund internal initiatives. And we'd like to look at M&A to how do we continue to accelerate that growth rate. Capabilities, things that surround our business, whether it's distribution, product, internal capabilities, we'll continue to look at. And when you do all of those different things, we then look at our -- how we'll deploy it back to our shareholders. Steve mentioned the dividend expectation even ticked up a little bit, that 10% to 15% range this year. And share repurchase, which is double where it was a year ago at 500 million. Doing all of that, we still have building capital levels, and we'll have to contemplate that over time, what we want to do with that. These are different trend lines that we're on from a generation as well as from a deployment perspective. And so we'll be thoughtful in 2024 about how we do that. I think Steve articulated on one of his slides and mentioned, we're going to be dynamic with share repurchase. So it's not something we're putting out there today. But clearly, as you said, we're in a much higher level of capital that we've seen over time. And we have lots of potential uses for it. Nothing particular that we have today we build, but we'd love to use some of that capital to deploy to grow our business faster, and then if we don't see that opportunity, to turn it back to our shareholders."", 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""Got it. Very helpful. And then I wanted to go back to some of the comments you're making on being fully funded on LTC. I guess when I look at the one slide that's got the bullet on reserves peaking in 10 years, and there's -- I know you talked in the past about the natural sort of higher required capital is that reserve level builds. If we think through where interest rates are right now and sort of the billion and change of PDR balance coming down, is that enough to be fully funded just for like some finite period of time? Or when you were looking at that reserve build and then getting over the peak of it, is it really that your base case is that you're actually projecting at this point that you never have to fund it ever again? I mean I just want to understand what you mean by being fully funded and if that's changed at all?"", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes. This is Steve. So I would separate. When we say fully funded and those statements, that's specific to -- in 2023, we fully recognize the PDR and we downstream capital, okay?If I look forward, though, and we look at current interest rates and we look at our current best estimate assumptions there, we do believe that, that will be kind of self-contained funding for all the required capital that would be needed for the build of those reserves over the next 10 years. And then once you get beyond that, those reserves will start to release, which will start to release some of the required capital behind that as well. So right now, with our current projections, we do take a longer-term view that we're not going to need to contribute capital to fund long-term care."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Jefferies.', 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', 'Just starting with long-term care, Rick, you had mentioned this, I think, in your opening comments about pursuing risk transfer. Obviously, the environment is dynamic. We saw a transaction late last year. Other companies have talked about bid-ask coming in. So can you just give us a sense maybe where you are in that process, what the conversations are like? Has there been a change, given some of the actions that you took last year as well as the rate environment?', 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""Sure. Thanks, Suneet. Just a couple of comments. One, you mentioned the transaction that happened last year. It was good to see. It was a positive development. I think after many years, where we've been talking about it, but you haven't seen anything in the market. So I just articulate a positive development. If you look at the transaction that was done, it's very consistent with how we've been talking about it, in terms of parsing out certain risks within our block, taking on different things, finding the right counterparty. All of those are things that we've been talking about what a transaction might look like. For us, our message is very consistent around that. So we have the ability to work with counterparties, to do that, to parse out different things, the bid-ask spread that we look at. And when that closes, we'll be looking at a transaction. We're not there in terms of what we've seen out there, but we're going to stay very active in the markets. And I think that we'll look forward to more buyers meeting sellers, but I don't think there's a change in our tone overall from a market perspective, but we're very happy to see that positive development happen in the market. So hopefully, that answer -- I think our messaging will be very consistent. The only thing that's different is something has happened in the market, and that's a good thing."", 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', ""Got it. That makes sense. And then I guess, as we think about your capital plans for 2024 and in particular, that slide that looked at where you expect to be at year-end '24, I think all measures are higher than where you ended 2023. And so I guess the question is, is there a thought there around maybe holding back on some of the capital deployment in anticipation of some sort of transaction with respect to LTC? Is that part of the capital philosophy at the company?"", 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""It's really not. When we think of a potential transaction out there, we think we -- before this year, we had plenty of capital to do it. Steve had on his slide, we have a lot of debt capacity as well. So I really would take that out of it. We're not earmarking any of those excess funds we're talking about for any particular use. We'd love to see it in terms of the good M&A transaction. If something could happen in LTC, that would be good as well, but we're not holding back any funds waiting for a transaction to happen. We've got the flexibility, the capacity to do something, even as we stood at -- even as we stand today or as we project out over the course of the year."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""First had a question on competition in the disability market. If you look at margins, for you guys for most of your peers, they've been very strong. So just wondering why you haven't seen competition pick up or -- because I would have normally thought that with margins being as strong as they are, you would have seen prices come down a lot on 1/1 renewals, and it doesn't seem like they've moved down as much."", 'Unidentified Company Representative', 'Chris?', 'Christopher Wallace Pyne', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Jimmy. Competition is always out there. That's for sure. But I would take you back to some of the things that we do, both from a capabilities perspective and from a claims management perspective.So again, our customers are buying a broader experience from us. I'll give you an example from My Unum. Smaller customers who are looking for a completely integrated set of products that work really well from an administration standpoint and an enrollment standpoint. We've got the right contracts and cover so they get really high-quality insurance. And of course, that ultimately ends up in a wonderful claim experience. Going upmarket. HR Connect is a great example, where somebody is buying our products because of deep integration with leading HCM platforms like ADP's Workforce Now, Workday and UKG.And then again, if somebody buys the Total Leave package from us, they're looking for us to solve a very significant challenge with claims administration and compliance on leave management. With that comes a great insurance products. We've got a phenomenal claim team behind those products that do a wonderful job to make sure we pay exactly what we should pay and do it with great care and compassion. We do a great job of getting people back to work, and incidence has been favorable in the current environment, which we expect to continue. So you put that whole thing together, and we, again, I go back to where I started the conversation around strong disciplined underwriting. We've got a very kind of logical way to kind of describe fair price in that environment, and it's generating strong returns. And again, this has been for a period of time, and we expect it to continue."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""Okay. And then just following up on -- you've made a few comments on M&A. And in the past, you've done a few smaller type deals. What is it that you're looking for ideally in terms of M&A? And would you be interested in sort of larger deals as well? Or should we assume a consistent approach to what you've done in the past?"", 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""I think the assumption would be a consistent approach. I think we're looking at not necessarily to go far afield, but to build our positions that we have. We have opportunities to do that. There are some areas we'd like to continue to build out across the franchise, across the world on that front. But when you think about other bigger transactions that do basically what we're doing today, we're going to be very, very selective, because we think we have the opportunity to grow it organically. So hope that gives you a sense. We were very happy with the transaction we've done. Although it's been a couple of years since we've done one, but we're going to be out there in the market continuing to look at what makes sense for us and most importantly, what's on strategy."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI.', 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""Just a few on long-term care. First is the elevated claim frequency versus your expectation? I'm solving for around 3% to 4% elevated. Does that sound about right to you? Or would you adjust that figure?"", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes. I probably don't want to specifically attribute the impact of claims incidents to the loss ratio. I think what I'd take you back to is just the net premium ratio and really thinking about if our actual performance is equal to the expectations built into our reserve, we should have a loss ratio of around 95%. And clearly, claims incidence has been elevated over the last several quarters, and so you've seen that NPR creep up just a little bit. And historically, you've seen higher-than-expected loss ratios. But that's probably the best way to think about it, Tom. In my comments, I did say we expect that elevation to continue some into 2024 and then dissipate over time."", 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""But just directionally, I just want to make sure we're not talking about elevated incidents of double digits that with what you're seeing on the claims front, it's less than that. Is that -- even not looking for a specific number, just want to know directionally, are we talking about a big change in incidence or not?"", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes. Again, going into next year, we don't anticipate it getting worse than what we've seen in the back half of the year. And the loss ratio that we reported during those periods of time were around [105%, 107%]. So I wouldn't see it going beyond that. But we just have to see how it plays out in the future."", 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""Got you. And then second question, just the higher level of resubmission of claims that you were highlighting. Can you talk about, maybe unpack that a little bit? What's happening exactly? Were there lower acceptance rates before? How does that process work? And this sounds like there's a little bit of an inventory on the resubmission of claims, but if you can expand on that?"", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes. I mean resubmission is going to happen in a lot of ways. We start to track the claim pretty early on in the submission process. And so a lot of things going to happen. People can withdraw the claim. We can close the claim before it starts to pay. It may go to pay status, but it recovers very quickly. And that happens for a variety of reasons. Some of it around us accepting the claim and approving the claim. Some of it may be policyholder driven, that they've changed their mind around the claims submission and come off a claim.What I would just say, though, is we have seen a higher level of that than we've historically seen and it's something that we track, but it does create a little bit of pressure in kind of our expected incidence counts over time."", 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""Got you. And then just one final one on risk transfer. I guess, one prominent feature of the MFC deal was their willingness to package some other risks along with LTC. And again this is just my opinion, but I believe that expanded the number of reinsurers willing to get involved. Is that -- would you guys -- I think the way you've talked about it in the past was LTC-only deal, not really packaging other risks. But if it allowed you to get something done, do you have the ability? And would you consider packaging other risks along with LTC?"", 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""Yes. Tom, the way I'd answer that is we've talked about how buyers can meet sellers in the process. And as we look at it, we talk to counterparties and -- we've talked about it within the LTC block of how we would parse risks, think about asset management, aspects of that, think about liabilities. But certainly, we would be open to other things that buyers would be looking for around the franchise. So I wouldn't take that off the table, and we would have that opportunity."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.', 'Ryan Joel Krueger', 'First, just a quick follow-up. Is your expectation still that in 2024, you will earn within the $130 million to $160 million range in the Closed Block, or maybe towards the lower end? Or -- can you give any more color on kind of what you assumed for the earnings, given the higher incidents that you expect near term?', 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes. It's in that range. And the 2 variables would be claims incidents and really the alternative asset portfolio. We have assumed that we get back to kind of longer-term yields on that portfolio. And as you know, that tends to be volatile quarter-to-quarter."", 'Ryan Joel Krueger', 'Got it. And if I could ask, I guess, one more on risk transfer. You do have the first Unum New York entity, which has, I think, a lot of older age long-term care in it and pretty conservative reserves due to the requirements in New York. Is selling the entire legal entity another option beyond -- separate from reinsurance? Or are there other liabilities in that entity, that would prevent that from occurring?', 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""Yes. I appreciate the question, Ryan. I'm not sure I want to get into too much detail. I think I'd just go back to my earlier comments, which is we look at the entirety of our long-term care exposure and think about how we can parse those different risks in different ways. I wouldn't want to get into a legal entity or even duration-specific things until we get closer to getting something done."", 'Ryan Joel Krueger', 'Okay. And then if I could maybe just sneak one last one. You talked broadly about the good environment for renewals. But could you give us any more color on just the pricing dynamic in Unum U.S., where prices -- like when you look at prices as a whole, were they relatively flat? Or did you bring them down some for disability, if can you give us any more sense of what happened there?', 'Christopher Wallace Pyne', ""Yes. Thanks, Ryan. It's Chris. We're constantly looking at different ways to kind of make sure we can grow in the most logical and profitable way possible. So it's really -- consider it just our active underwriting and pricing approach. We're very thoughtful. We have tremendous data. We use it all the time to be as sharp as we possibly can. We recognize trends are early, and that goes into, what I would consider business as usual, in terms of thinking about price at the case level, thinking about price in different segments where we see opportunity.So it is a competitive world. We have growth expectations that we're really excited about. We're certain we can deliver, and we'll continue to kind of take that active approach to the process."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Wilma Burdis from Raymond James.', 'Wilma Carter Jackson Burdis', ""You guys touched on it, but I would like to confirm if 1.4 billion to 1.6 billion of annual capital generation is a good run rate beyond '24? Is there some risk to that level if disability results normalize?"", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes. Steve. I can take that. I think that's a good planning assumption. Obviously, over time, we like the franchise to continue to grow at some grade that would be reflected. But I think that's a good run rate. And that would anticipate for 2024, the group disability loss ratio to stay in the low 60s. Our planning assumptions for capital generation and for our GAAP earnings expectations would be consistent."", 'Wilma Carter Jackson Burdis', ""Okay. And then you have provided a new data point that LTC reserves are peaking in 10 years. That's sooner than I expected, especially on the group side. And it's a very good data point because it implies that we're a lot closer to knowing how reserves will develop than I initially anticipated. Could you talk about, is this an average across the block? And if so, is there a different peak reserving time line for the individual versus group blocks?"", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes. So it would be an aggregate view of the total reserve. And just due to the age of the blocks, you would logically think that the individual will peak sooner than the group. I would say though the magnitude of the reserves that we carry on those 2 are a bit different, just because of the relative size of the relative richness of benefits for our group business versus our individual business. So there's a lot of weighted averaging going on. But in aggregate, that's when it's going to peak."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America.', 'Joshua David Shanker', 'Sorry, one last transaction question. Apologies -- but you mentioned that in a number of years and things lined up properly, the interest rate situation is changing. Do you think there were unique circumstances on the ground that allowed a transaction to come together? Or are you currently seeing appetite that people are discussing wanting to do transactions as the matter of finding the right one for you?', 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""Yes. So I wouldn't want to speculate. I don't know what was going on, particularly on the ground with that transaction. I can look at it just as you can from a far and say that it's a positive development for the industry and for people that are looking to do something on that front. And I would just say we have had very consistent dialogue, very consistent outreach expectations parsing. So I don't think our world has necessarily changed as a result of that. But I think it's good for the world to see that these transactions can happen, and we'll continue to pursue such a transaction."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from Truist.', 'Mark Douglas Hughes', ""Just one quick one. Anything nonrecurring in the recoveries? Recoveries have been very strong. We've heard from other companies that social security administration has been kind of stingy in their payouts. I know that's only a part of your recovery story. But is that something that should be sustainable?"", 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes. I can answer that, Mark. So I would say that if you go back really several years, we have seen a continued improvement in the performance of recoveries within our group disability block. And so what we're seeing in the more recent history is just a continuation of that. And so I would not view the performance in the fourth quarter as being in any way unique or nonsustainable. And that's why we feel pretty comfortable giving guidance going into next year, that we'll be able to maintain those levels of benefit ratios, that not only to the market dynamics that Chris spoke to around pricing, but also just around our operational excellence and being able to maintain that level of performance."", 'Mark Douglas Hughes', ""And I'll maybe throw in one more, the Colonial sales are pretty strong this quarter, up 12%. You talked about high single digits. Was there an unusual boost or easy comp this quarter?"", 'Timothy Gerald Arnold', ""Yes. Thank you for the question. This is Tim. I would say that comps were not that easy, although they weren't extremely challenging either. But we feel good about where we landed the quarter end. Frankly, the year, we think the market is growing in the 4% to 6% range, and we came out at the top end of that range. We really like our strategy. We think we have the tools and technology to help our agents, brokers and clients achieve their goals. We grew our sales leadership team by 8% last year. And on the third quarter call, I mentioned that we are strengthening our offering in the large case commercial market. And while we still have a little bit of work to do there, we're really pleased that we saw a fourth quarter growth rate in the 500-plus life market of 36%. So really just focused on consistency of execution and broad-based adoption of those differentiating tools and technology that we have in our portfolio. As we look forward, a couple of the leading indicators we watch are new recruits and sales productivity from those new agents in the 2023 in total. Recruiting was up 23% and new agent sales were up 18%. Since all of you been sneaking in one last question. I'll answer a question you didn't ask. But we saw really strong growth on the Unum [BB] side of 10.2% last year. We're excited about the opportunities we have to cross-sell into the group block and to take advantage of those technology solutions that Chris mentioned earlier and grow that book as well."", 'Mark Douglas Hughes', 'Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ward from Citi.', 'Michael Augustus Ward', 'Just quickly, I was wondering if you had any kind of similar commentary on the benefit ratio guidance quantification type range for AD&D or supplemental and voluntary like you gave for group disability?', 'Steven Andrew Zabel', ""Yes, this is Steve. I can cover that. Maybe I'll go across all the businesses. We've talked about group disability quite a bit. I might just touch on Group Life. Group Life had a very good quarter in the fourth quarter, which we do not believe is sustainable. So I think a good planning assumption there would be more in that 73% to 75% range. And then for really all of our other alliance, including the ones that you mentioned, I would just go back to the guidance that we gave last year, and where those businesses have historically performed. I think that's probably a pretty good indicator of our view of how they're going to perform going forward."", 'Michael Augustus Ward', ""Okay. And then maybe for capital return for '24. It sounds like there is some excess there or capital left over. Just curious, like, let's say, you don't come across any acquisition opportunities or bolt-ons, what have you? Should we think about potential upside to that? Or should we think of that as like a realistic like straight-line guidance for the year?"", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""Yes. I think, Mike, the way I'd look at it is kind of how Steve saw, it will be dynamic. So we don't just set a plan and set it and forget it. We actually will be back at it all the time. So building up that excess throughout the course of the year, we're going to be making decisions constantly about what we want to do with that. And as we get closer to those decisions, we'll certainly give the market some heads up around that."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI.', 'Thomas George Gallagher', 'Just a question on sales. Long-term disability sales were down 12%. Group Life and AD&D were up 61%. Can you comment on the mix? Should we take that to mean more price competition in long-term disability and less in group life? Is that why there was a shift or something else happening there?', 'Christopher Wallace Pyne', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Tom, it's Chris. Actually, it's a good call. We saw some great opportunity in group life package with -- a lot of it was packaged with current customers. So always nice to add life insurance in that environment.We actually did have more strength in the disability sales line than it would appear. Full year sales were up 14% and in the quarter for pure disability, pure LTD up high single digit, 8% or so. What you don't see at the surface is we did have soft stop-loss sales in the quarter, and that had an impact on the overall disability sales line as we report them together. But in general, any given quarter, it can be a little bit volatile, but we did see very good sales growth in group LTD and group STD for both the quarter and the full year. Extra good in group life this quarter and the mix will move around over time."", 'Thomas George Gallagher', 'And so that -- and sorry, that the stop loss, is that medical stop loss? Or is that disability stop loss? What type of product is that?', 'Christopher Wallace Pyne', 'Medical stop loss.', 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""Yes, Tom, this is a line that we launched several years ago. Just to clear, this is the line we launched several years ago opportunistically, and so you'll see that be a little bit more volatile, but I think it's a good call out within the results. LTD was actually quite strong from a sales perspective."", 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Rick McKenney, I turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks.', 'Richard Paul McKenney', ""Great. Thank you, Rob. I appreciate everybody sticking with us for a little bit more time today as we put together both the results of 2023 and our outlook for 2024. We'll be out there working at different conferences, talking to different investors. We look forward to meeting up with you here in the next several months. And I appreciate you spending the time on today's call. With that, we'll end the call, Rob. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

It's a pleasure to be here with you all today, sharing the journey of Unum throughout 2023 and where we're headed in 2024. This is the first time we've shared our outlook in conjunction with our year-end results, and I think it works well given the consistency of our actions and performance across the company."", ""As we reflect on our progress and look ahead, I am proud to affirm our unwavering commitment to our purpose of helping the working world thrive throughout life's moments. Steadfast focus and commitment to this purpose is delivering value to customers, employees, communities, and of course, to shareholders. 2023 was a year of exceptional results across the board with a highlight being our decades-long leadership in disability insurance shining through and core business growth momentum building stronger with significant strides and accelerating our industry-leading digital capabilities. The capabilities we are bringing to market such as HR Connect, Total Leave, Gathr, and Help@hand are becoming connection points with employers and employees to bring greater customer satisfaction to the benefits experience."", 'These advancements have been influential in attracting and retaining customers, setting us apart in a competitive landscape and ultimately driving strong top-line results, including sales of over 13% for the full year of 2023 and premium growth of over 5%. This top-line growth has returned steadily throughout the year and has us on the trajectory that we look for in our business model. As the top line has returned in 2023, our discipline with how we run the business has not wavered. Our pricing and underwriting has remained consistent to continue to deliver growth and high returns on equity.', 'Overall, we grew EPS 23% with most of our product lines delivering on our expectations throughout the year. I mentioned the highlight of group disability returns, but I would extend that to most of our products and continue to -- that continue to generate mid to high-teen returns. An area that understandably received attention in the third quarter was our closed block. We have seen volatility in the performance of that block, and today, Steve will provide some ways to look at its overall health and performance outside of just its loss ratio.', ""From a capital standpoint, we've executed our plans exactly how we described them coming into the year and with good results. So, we exceeded expectations on value delivered to our shareholders. We raised our dividend by 10% and increased the pace of our share repurchases throughout 2023 and announced a plan to double the amount we repurchase in 2024 with our $500 million authorization. Most notably, we described a desire to fully fund the premium deserved -- premium deficiency reserve and contribute to capital needed to support our long-term care block."", 'Steve will discuss further, but let me emphasize, given our current assumptions and capital buffers, we have stated that we believe long-term care will not need additional capital for five years. But in reality, our belief is that will be true for much longer. Across the company, the reason that we have been able to achieve such capital results goes back to the fact that our businesses steadily generate strong cash flow, and with a year of good results, we ended the year with financial metrics that were stronger than expected, including holding company cash of $1.7 billion and RBC of 415%. Looking forward, we now expect to generate free cash flow between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion per year.', ""As we transition to think about 2024, the momentum from the past several years continues. We're witnessing both a market backdrop and economic environment that are highly supportive of our business, providing us with ample opportunities to grow and thrive. Our focus is to continue building on our solid foundation. We're dedicated to enhancing our core operations, maintaining our disciplined approach, and continuing to innovate in ways that resonate with our customers and the market."", ""When we look across the company, we are hitting the ground running, and our teams are looking to build on some very strong growth rates with consolidated sales growth of high single digits and, combined with good persistency, yielding premium growth in the 5% to 7% range. Consistent margins and the purchasing of shares will deliver growth of 7% to 9% on top of the 23% adjusted EPS growth we delivered in 2023. Our customer-centric approach remains at the heart of our strategy. We're constantly adapting our services to meet changing market needs, ensuring we remain the preferred choice for our clients."", ""When we met last February, we outlined our strategy and plans to build on our market-leading position. We can report that we are advancing along all fronts, and we are seeing the results. For Unum in the U.S., we are leveraging our go-to-market expertise to connect benefit solutions to HR platforms effectively while also ensuring our leave management is a differentiator. With over 1,500 customers and counting, we've reached a notable sales milestones with our HR Connect capability, which deeply integrates with leading human capital management platforms, and we now cover over 1 million employees through Unum's Total Leave offering."", 'In addition, we saw strong momentum in the trend of customers bundling products. Our efforts are geared toward seamless enrollment, billing, and administration via MyUnum and establishing robust connections with select third-party platforms. These efforts to leverage technology to improve the customer experience are paying off. And in 2023, we saw record levels of employer satisfaction for customers on the MyUnum platform.', 'In Colonial Life, the focus is on continuing to build and support our independent sales force with enhanced tools and solutions such as our proprietary industry-leading Agent Assist technology, which enables automated lead generations, CRM, and workflow, boosting agent productivity. Another key development in our arsenal is Gathr, which modernizes enrollment and benefits administration and streamlines the client experience. The offering has been building as evidenced by the annual premium associated with it, increasing from $10 million to $50 million over the course of 2023. And finally, enabling Colonial Life agents to offer Unum employer-paid products ensures they have the solution for any employer or broker.', ""For Unum U.K., our approach has been to redefine the broker experience, setting a market-leading standard that is distinctively Unum and enhancing our relationship management model. We are dedicated to providing value-added services that drive customer engagement and loyalty such as through Help@hand, which offers integrated value-added services, and by delivering comprehensive management information that yields actionable insights. Moreover, we're expanding our product set to encompass a broader spectrum of risk and well-being solutions, ensuring we meet the diverse needs of our clients. And finally, in Unum Poland, we're forging ahead with a robust strategy tailored to the local market."", ""We're scaling our direct-to-SME sales team and fortifying partnerships with local brokers, thereby extending our distribution network and geographical reach. All these efforts will drive growth in the number of employers and customers we serve and, in turn, will generate the growth of premiums and earnings we have articulated. Looking forward, we will also remain disciplined stewards of our capital and franchise value, and the consistency of our capital priorities remains intact. First, we ensure investments directly supporting our business."", 'We have a clear growth strategy, continue to build out our offerings, and capitalize on our well-positioned and profitable products. Second, we will look externally to identify and pursue selective M&A that supports our internal initiatives and that are in line with this strategy. And third, we will continue to return capital to shareholders via regular dividend increases and share repurchases as we have demonstrated through our actions and increasing both commensurate with our plans. Summing it up, our strong capital generation, $500 million of share repurchases, and no LTC contributions will leave us in a position of greater than 400% RBC and holding company cash greater than $2 billion.', ""For 2024, our commitment to innovation, prudent capital allocation, and shareholder returns remains steadfast. As a result, we are on track to surpass the objectives we established a year ago and our 4 to 5 position in the market is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our teams across the globe. The strides we've made in our digital footprint, customer engagement, and capital management are the very engines of our growth. In closing, we enter 2024 with confidence in our position and ready to build off of our achievements of 2023."", ""With our customer-first mindset, agile operations, and comprehensive financial strategies, we are not just anticipating the future; we are actively shaping it. 2024 is going to be an exciting year for Unum. I'd like to now hand it over to Steve to provide further insights into our financial strategy and outlook, as well as provide insight into the closed block. Thanks for your attention once again today."", ""And, Steve, I'll turn it over to you."", 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Great. Thanks, Rick, and good morning to everyone. As Rick mentioned, we were extremely pleased with the strong finish to the year across the board. This caps two years of continued momentum building in our core operating segments.', 'This is evident in both our sales and operating results. For the full year, sales were up 15.1% in Unum U.S., 26.7% in Unum International, and 6.2% in Colonial Life where we saw accelerating growth each quarter, including 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year ago. Premium for our core operations increased 6.1% in the quarter compared to a year ago and finished up 5.2% for the full year, exceeding the expectation laid out last February and more consistent with our long-term expectation. Disability results were favorable across the company as well, highlighted by a group disability benefit ratio of 59.1% for the full year and 59.5% in the quarter.', 'We do expect benefit ratios in the low 60s to continue in the near to midterm as we continue to see support for these levels in both our operations and in the market. These same trends are also supporting strong performance in our individual disability and U.K. Group Income Protection product lines. We ended the year with after-tax adjusted operating income at $1.5 billion and after-tax adjusted operating EPS of $7.66, which represents growth of 23.3% over historically reported full-year 2022.', ""The fourth-quarter results of reported after-tax adjusted operating EPS of $1. 79 was impacted by two items that I'd like to mention. First, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was elevated at 22.8%. We expect the long-term rate to be between 21.1% and 22% -- or 21.5 to 22% and vary some from period to period due to foreign tax dynamics."", 'The variance in the fourth quarter lowered EPS by approximately $0.03. Further, Colonial Life benefits were higher by $21.7 million, or $0.09 of EPS pressure, due to a one-time reserve model refinement. When adjusting for these two items, which represents a better view of underlying earnings power, adjusted operating EPS in the quarter would have been $0.12 higher. The strong earnings power for GAAP was also apparent in our statutory results with full-year after-tax operating earnings of over $1.3 billion, well ahead of our outlook last year of roughly $1 billion.', ""These results drove significant upside to our original expectation of capital generation and, as a result, our capital position. Top-line results were also notable this year with both sales and premium for our core operations outperforming the top end of their outlook ranges at 13.4% and 5.2%, respectively. Fourth-quarter results also show that momentum isn't slowing, which we believe will set us up nicely for continued growth in 2024. These strong growth metrics are testament to the value of our offering in the market and the success we are seeing with our key strategic initiatives that Rick discussed."", 'Investing in these capabilities to grow our core business is a key capital priority, and as a result, the full-year 2023 adjusted operating expense ratio increased to 21.7%, slightly above our expectations coming into the year. We continue to expect the expense ratio to taper off over time as the impact of our investments take further hold. For full-year 2024, we expect our adjusted operating expense ratio to be slightly lower than 2023. Now, let me briefly review our 2023 results by segment.', 'For Unum U.S., adjusted operating income increased 39.4% to $1.36 -- or to $1.36 billion in 2023, compared to $972.6 million in 2022. As mentioned earlier, these results were bolstered by disability performance with group disability experiencing full-year adjusted operating earnings growth of 56.1% and our individual disability line of business driving overall supplemental and voluntary growth of 11.7% for the year. Further, group disability ended the year with an ROE of 30.8%. The group life in AD&D lines experienced adjusted operating earnings growth of 94.8% as the impacts from the pandemic waned.', ""The fourth-quarter results of $68 million were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic and were driven by favorable waiver experience, lower incidents in AD&D with continued lower mortality results. From a growth perspective, Unum U.S.'s earned premium grew 5.2% to $6.6 billion due to natural growth, higher sales, and solid persistency. This result was in line with our expected premium growth rate of 4% to 6%. Now, moving to Unum International."", ""The segment continued to show strong trends in its underlying earnings power with adjusted operating income of $158.1 million for the year, up 18% compared to the prior year. Fourth-quarter U.K. results were in line with our outlook for adjusted operating earnings levels in the mid-20 million pounds range excluding the impacts of inflation. Inflation has moderated since last year's highs, and we expect this will continue as the environment normalizes but still benefited the U.K."", 'this quarter by approximately 5 million pounds. We are extremely pleased with the growth levels in the U.K., highlighted by full-year sales growth of 18.6% and premium growth of 11.6%, well ahead of our original expectations of 2% to 5% and 2% to 4%, respectively. While the U.K. business is a major driver of this segment, Poland saw significant levels of growth, increasing sales 76% and premium 24.2% for the year.', 'Now, turning to Colonial. The segment saw growth return after a couple of years of challenged results due to the impacts of the pandemic on our sales process and agent productivity. Sales growth of 6.2% and premium growth of 1.4% for the full year does drive optimism for the further growth in 2024, and our ultimate target to return to the high single-digit level of growth that this segment historically achieved. From an adjusted operating earnings perspective, full-year results of $400.1 million were lower than $412.9 million a year ago, largely due to a number of unique items throughout the year, including the reserve model refinement in 4Q.', ""That said, full-year ROE was impressive at 18.1%, and we expect a high level of earnings power from this line as we enter 2024. Switching gears to the closed block of business and focusing on this quarter, adjusted operating earnings of $21.3 million were below our expected run rate of $30 million to $40 million and last quarter's results of $34.2 million, as both long-term care and the remainder of our closed disability block saw sequential declines. The net premium ratio, which is indicative of the lifetime benefit ratio expectation, increased slightly to 93.5% from 93.4% in the third quarter of 2023. Under LDTI, the combination of earnings results and movements in the net premium ratio provides a more comprehensive view of long-term care claims performance compared to the previously reported interest-adjusted loss ratio, which we observed could distort underlying claims experience trends and focus solely on experience in that quarter."", 'Overall, underlying claims experience for the block was largely in line with third quarter. Incidents remained above long-term expected levels but has improved from the higher levels seen earlier in 2023. We continue to believe that the elevated incidence rates in 2023 were a function of inventory levels normalizing in the environment following the pandemic. We expect to see a continuation of claims catch up in 2024 albeit at a dissipating rate.', 'Lastly, for the closed block, our alternative investment portfolio, which largely backs LTC, produced income of $21.5 million in the quarter. Since inception, our diversified alternative portfolio has produced returns in line with our long-term expectation of 8% to 10%. Rounding out the segments, the corporate segment produced a loss of $36.5 million in the quarter, and we expect this level of loss to continue at slightly higher levels in 2024. So, then stepping back, 2023 was an incredible year for the company.', ""And as we turn to 2024, we see many of the same tailwinds and opportunities to win. So, with all that considered, it's time to talk about our outlook for this year. And I'll start with a review of business growth and earnings power, discuss how that plays in the capital generation, and then I'll end with a little bit of a discussion on how we're executing on our strategy for long-term care. So, just to orient everyone on the slides and make sure that we're following along, we're on Page 7, and I want to kick off this discussion."", 'I really reflect back to a year ago at our last outlook meeting. And in summary, we have delivered what we described last February when we were in New York City and are poised to deliver even stronger performance in 2024. We led off that discussion with a key message, and that message was that we have the ability and capacity to chart our course in 2023. And I believe that is even more true as we go into 2024.', ""So, four key messages for the outlook discussion. Number one is top-line growth. It is very strong, and it's fueled by momentum and the digital capabilities that Rick mentioned. Number two, the earning growth rates really stabilizing back to our long-term expected range after two years of very high levels of growth coming out of the pandemic."", 'And specifically, some highlights that I like to note: First, group disability is back to pre-pandemic incidence rates with historically favorable levels of recovery. The second thing to note is group life is back to pre-pandemic levels of earnings. Third, we have a full recovery of our U.K. business model with double-digit growth rates.', ""And lastly, momentum continuing to build in Colonial Life and the franchise that we have there. The third message for the outlook is we're at an inflection point in free cash flow, and that's due to no contributions needed for long-term care in 2024, which will allow us to return more capital to shareholders while maintaining significant capital buffers. And I would end with the key message of our capital generation is really at full strength with all capital metrics well in excess of targets. So, then I'll move on to Page 8, and I just want to briefly hit on some highlights for top-line expectations."", 'We have healthy core businesses which will deliver strong levels of growth in 2024, but I want to reflect a little bit that we just came off a really good growth story in 2023. In Unum U.S., sales grew 15% with premium growing over 5%. In international, sales grew close to 30%, premium growing over 14%. And in Colonial, sales growing at 6.2% with premium close to 1.5% growth.', 'And then, I would say to top this all off, we have maintained industry-leading margins. Our secret sauce is really to grow in a disciplined way that is sustainable and leads ultimately to earnings growth and capital generation for future growth and deployment to our shareholders. Moving on to Page 9, talk a little bit more about earnings growth. So, the top-of-the-house view here is, with most of our 2024 metrics, they are in or relatively in line with our long-term expectations.', ""Long-term expectations for sales increased as we see the benefits of our investments in technology. We have strong projected earnings growth despite record levels of earnings power in 2023. It really shows the strength of the franchise. But what I'm most optimistic about is our premium growth story as we believe the growth rates of our core businesses can surpass the growth we saw in 2023, which was still a year of recovery in some ways."", 'Then transitioning to Page 10, talk a little bit about our sources and uses of capital and orient you on the left side of the page around capital generation and really start with statutory earnings. Similar to the GAAP earnings that we just discussed, U.S. statutory earnings are also projected to be robust. And -- but the one thing, just to remind the audience of, is that these earnings will be available for dividends up to the holding company in the following year or 2025, but 2023 statutory earnings of over $1.3 billion are available to us this year in 2024.', ""I'd move next to international dividends. Given the recent performance in the U.K., they are now able to contribute their fair share of earnings through dividends to the holding company. Next, our service agreements, those are mainly through investment management agreements and they continue to be a strong source of free cash flow to the holding company. And so, our capital generation capacity remains strong and in line with our 2023 actuals but well above last year's outlook."", 'So, considering our interest expense expectation of $200 million, our free cash flow generation is a healthy 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion as we move past the period of capital contributions being needed for LTC. So, then, we arrive at capital deployment back to our shareholders, and that is also increasing significantly with an expected increase in the dividend of 10% to 15%, which we will discuss with our board later this spring and announce in the coming months and doubling the amount of dollar spent on share repurchase consistent with the authorization we received at the end of last year. I would note that these repurchases in 2024 may not be straight-lined throughout the year if we do see opportunities in the market to maximize this authorization throughout the year. And then, our use of excess capital generated will follow our capital priorities, grow core businesses either through organic investment or inorganically, shareholder dividends, and then share repurchase.', ""So, then moving on to Slide 11, talk a little bit about capital targets. I'm not going to spend too much time here as you will see consistency in our targets and our company performance. 2023 saw capital levels well in excess of our targets and 2024 projections to be similar, providing a substantial financial flexibility. I will add that these levels of flexibility are supportive of our goal of maintaining a single A financial strength rating."", ""We continue to make progress on that front in 2023 with our upgrade by Fitch toward the end of last year. OK, let's move on to a few topics regarding long-term care and I will move to page 13. So, to recap our strategy, we have a focused strategy for managing the closed block, which we have progressed and continue to progress and is focused on three things: creating value, reducing the footprint, and increasing predictability of outcomes. In line with the strategy, we executed on a number of items we teed up as priorities with you in early 2023, and we continue to use a number of actions as we enter 2024."", ""We have continued to mitigate interest rate risk and have done so at the current favorable interest rate environment. By repositioning cash flows and hedging, we've been able to reduce interest rate sensitivity to date by 25%. And how we measure that is with a basic DV01 measurement, which is really the dollar duration impact to surplus. So, think about the sensitivity of our surplus to 100-basis-point movement in prevailing interest rates."", 'We continue to pursue justified rate increases. Last year, we achieved over a 450 million in GPV of increases and are nearing $4.5 billion of rate increase value since we started our program. And then, we are using our strong capital position to create capital capacity and flexibility, providing the ability to navigate adverse events and creating confidence in our go-forward free cash flows. As committed last year, we fully recognized the premium deficiency reserve at year-end.', ""This was an important step in protecting our future cash flows, and we will talk more on this in a moment. And finally, we remain active and will continue to look for risk transfer solutions. So, then moving on to Page 14, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about our interest rate risk management and really want to cover three topics here: one, discuss where we've been and accomplished over the last year; two, what the benefit of those actions were; and three, how that has helped to mitigate any capital requirements in a downside interest rate scenario. So, first of all, I'll talk about hedging and repositioning and how that's allowed us to better match duration, improve quality, and reduce interest sensitivity."", ""So, we kicked off our more recent hedging program at the beginning of last year. Since then, we have entered into 2.6 billion of notional Treasury forwards, and those do have an average Treasury yield of 4%. And as you know, we look out and take a seven-year horizon. And it's really to try to de-risk the yields at which we can invest those cash flows as we look to the near to medium term."", 'Secondly, in the third quarter of last year, we executed on a $700 million repositioning program within the LTC portfolio. And the objective of that was really to look at shorter-duration assets and de-risk the new money rate that we would be able to invest those on and extend the duration to longer-duration assets. We took the opportunity to do that at a nice place in -- in the interest rate environment. We improved portfolio quality; we increased yield; and we did extend duration with no capital impact.', ""And so, the results of that is we were able -- as I mentioned, we were able to improve our duration matching measures by 25%, but we also reduced the PDR in Unum America, the sensitivity to interest rate movements by 30%. And that's really demonstrated then in the chart on the right side of the page. And so, let me explain the table on the right quickly. It's really the same concept that we used in our Investor Day materials last year, but I just want to orient you."", ""At year-end, the premium deficiency reserve that was recorded was at $1.6 billion. And then, the sensitivities that we're showing here are for the 30-year Treasury yield and the impact that those would have over time with our new money rate assumption that then is incorporated into our liability discount rate. And so, as an example, at a 4% assumption, the $1.6 billion of PDR would be reduced by 1.1 billion assuming that the 4% assumption worked its way all the way into our three-year trailing average that we use for that construct. So, the dynamic, it really provides flexibility and appropriately manage our LTC commitments."", ""And so, I think it's key -- two concepts here. One, we do have time to adapt as those rates work into our assumption. But I think the other thing that's very important, and we have a note on the page, is that our interest rate management actions have significantly dampened any downside risk of interest rate movements on the PDR, our balance. And I'll call out the 2% assumption here and -- and highlight the fact that that sensitivity has been reduced by $450 million because of the actions that we have taken over the last couple of years around both hedging and our repositioning in the portfolio."", ""All right, then I'll move on to Page 15. And we wanted to give -- we want to give a little bit more information about both how we think about reserve sufficiency but also some sensitivities. And so, the orientation for this page is we talk about $2.8 billion of protection. What that really represents is our view of our current level of statutory reserves in excess of our view of the best estimate of that liability for the liability that's when -- within Unum America reinsured to Fairwind, plus the excess capital that we have within the Fairwind entity in excess of those targets that we set."", 'Then when you go to the table, those are really sensitivities independent of that protection, where we look at the assumptions built into our best estimate and we look at the dollar amount impact to our best estimate given the sensitivities. And so, specifically, I would say these are liability assumptions sensitivities, we addressed interest rate sensitivities on the previous page. So, let me walk you through a little bit the sensitivities themselves. So, on the premium rate increase, the $1 billion really represents the full amount of value we have currently in our best estimate assumption.', ""And so, the sensitivity is to completely remove that. I would say, from my perspective, we have had a great track record over the years to be able to deliver on achieving our premium rate targets. In fact, we've always -- we've already made very good progress in the achievement of that $1 billion just since we've launched the program back in the fall. Secondly, morbidity and mortality improvement, the assumption within the best estimate reserve is $700 million."", ""And so, this sensitivity would be to fully remove that. We do believe and we've seen over time improvement in both morbidity and mortality in our experience. So, we do believe that that assumption is backed up by the data and the experience that we've seen. But we've gone ahead, just for purposes of the presentation, to fully remove that to give an indication of the size of that assumption."", ""And then, we have three more assumptions which are policy lapse, mortality or claim incidents, and our claim resolutions. We've given sensitivities here down seven -- 7.5% for the level of lapses and mortalities, and increasing claim incidence of 3%, and a decrease in claim resolutions mostly due to mortality of 2%. And the way to think about that is that those -- those roughly approximate a one standard deviation difference over the -- the entire life of the business for these sensitivities. And you can see the resulting impacts to our best estimate."", ""The one thing to also remember, though, when it comes to those last three assumptions, it's critical to remember that we still do have the ability to increase our rate increase actions as a form to mitigate those adverse developments. And the impact of those additional rate increases are not reflected in these individual liability sensitivities. So, then, two other items to note on this page. First of all, excess capital, as it emerges, which we do think will emerge in Fairwind over time, it can be used to meet LTC needs across all legal entities."", ""And the point there is we do have the ability, over time, to make decisions about how to use that excess capital that, over time, we believe will build in Fairwind. And then, the second item of note is given our current position, along with the PDR balance dynamics described above, we'd be expected to meet the capital needs of the book as it does progress to peak reserves in the next 10 years. So, just to reiterate, under our current assumptions and in the current interest rate environment, the actions we have taken create confidence that future cash flows of the enterprise will be insulated from LTC needs. And then, I'll finish off on Page 16."", ""So, to close this out, let's discuss some key indicators of long-term health of the business. And we look at four metrics. First, the net NPR or net premium ratio. With the shift to LDTI, we believe that NPR provides a long-term outlook for block claim experience, and we will look at the movement in that metric over time."", ""We gave that movement in our comments this quarter, and we'll continue to do that over time. Secondly, closed block earnings. While we expect quarterly volatility, we would expect an annualized run rate in the $130 million to $160 million range in an environment where experience may vary quarter to quarter, assuming alternative asset yields are near longer-term ranges. The third metric would be rate increase progress, and this is a key element of our strategy."", ""And we monitor progress against our best estimate assumptions. Recall that we increase the scope of the program with our latest assumption review, and so we'll give information over time how we're progressing as a percentage against that best estimate assumption within the reserve liability. And then, lastly, the 30-year Treasury rate. And in particular, we will look for the three-year average to remain above the 2.84% rate, which represents the current three-year average."", 'That rate underlines our new money assumption that feeds into our liability discount rate for the premium deficiency reserve. Rates above this would signal a positive impact on the overall discount rate and related balance of the premium deficiency reserve as we represented on Page 14 of this deck. So, to wrap up, we have very exciting top and bottom-line expectations for 2024. We think our financial flexibility has never been stronger, and we look forward to the year ahead.', ""Thank you again for attending today's call, and I look forward to your questions. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Rick to close."", 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Great. Thank you, Steve. As you can see and based on Steve's and my comments, 2024 is shaping up to be a great year for Unum. The teams are very focused on what we want to achieve this year."", ""And continued momentum in our core business and the inflection point we're seeing with capital now that our LTC block is funded, as Steve articulated, really puts us in a very good spot. So, there's plenty of topics to discuss today. So, with that, I will -- the team is here to field questions, and I'll turn it back to you, Rob."", '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joel Hurwitz from Dowling and Partners. Your line is open.', 'Joel Hurwitz -- Dowling and Partners -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning. First, on the core businesses, if I compare the '24 earnings outlook relative to what you guys guided a year ago, I estimate that core business earnings expectations are over $150 million better than what would have been implied a year ago. I guess, do you see this level of core business earnings as sustainable longer term, or would you expect to have to give back some of the -- the favorable risk results over time?"", 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, this is Steve. I can take that question, and I'll just maybe get into the math a little bit how we're thinking about expectations going into '24. I think the key to think about with our core businesses, we do believe that we're going to be -- be able to maintain the margins in our group disability business through -- through the next year. And specifically, we believe that the benefit ratio for group disability will remain in that low 60% level."", 'I would also note that we do anticipate an increase in Colonial Life earnings. I did mention we had, you know, several one-time items that did dampen the earnings of Colonial Life in 2023. And we think, in 2024, that earnings will come through, you know, on a more kind of core basis. And then, maybe we can hit a little bit on just the commercial environment and competitive environment and just the level of pricing in the group benefits line.', 'Chris Pyne -- Executive Vice President, Group Benefits', ""Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Thanks for the question, Joel, this is Chris. You know, we're really excited about where we stand, and I'd like to start with capabilities."", ""When we're talking to new customers, you know, we're really there to help solve problems. We see, you know, many more prospects in the market who are looking to solve big problems that we address through, you know, some of the things Rick mentioned with -- with Total Leave, HR Connect, and MyUnum. That changes the game versus, you know, a more traditional price-check-type environment. So, from a new business perspective, we are writing strong levels of business."", ""We expect that to continue, and we're hitting price point, that's a great day. From a renewal perspective, you know, business is favorable. And we look at it very much on a case-by-case basis. We are -- our history of strong risk discipline, from an underwriting perspective, serves us really well."", ""Again, these customers value what we bring. We're able to show up in these discussions with an opportunity to talk about long-term price stability whether it be, you know, modest rate increase, rate pass, or rate reduction. And our persistency results through the close of '23 were quite strong as we go into '24."", 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I think, Joel, you hit it, it was a step up in 2023 from an earnings perspective, but you can see from our outlook in 2024, we're looking to grow off it. So, 7% to 9% on top of a very strong year. You know, all those indicators that we talked about, and as Chris articulated in particular to our group disability, but even our Colonial Life business are all intact. And that leads us to our -- our good outlook coming off of an incredibly strong year."", 'Joel Hurwitz -- Dowling and Partners -- Analyst', ""OK, helpful. And then, in terms of long-term care, I guess what gives you guys confidence that the experience you've been seeing is more of a catch-up versus a -- versus a longer-term shift in trends? And then, in terms of the outlook, what's embedded in the 2024 guidance for closed block earnings?"", 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, this is Steve, I can take that one. So, related to incidents, I just kind of take people back a little bit on long-term care and where we've been. At the beginning of 2023, we saw very elevated incidents through the first six months. We saw that start to abate a little bit in the third quarter, albeit at still elevated levels."", ""Going into the fourth quarter, I would say those incidence levels were pretty consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. But what we also saw during the pandemic were fairly low levels of incidents. And we could just see when we're looking at, you know, just kind of our inventory trend lines that we were a bit below the trend lines that we would ultimately expect. And so, as we approach back to those that gives us some confidence that this was just kind of pent-up demand."", ""The other thing that we've seen a lot of over the last six months, I would say, and maybe even a little bit before that, was a higher level of resubmission of claims. And those would be claims that had previously been submitted but either denied or closed or recovered for other reasons. And we've seen the level of those come back in, which might indicate claims that originally had been pulled back but now have been submitted. And so, obviously, we have to continue to monitor this."", ""We do believe that the level of incidents for a while in '24 will probably continue at an elevated level, but we would look to monitor that then as we get into the back half of the year. And I would say, within our outlook, we still do have a level of elevated incidents built into that outlook."", 'Joel Hurwitz -- Dowling and Partners -- Analyst', 'OK, thank you.', 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Joel.', 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Joel.', 'Operator', 'As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Alex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Hi, good morning. First question I had is just on the excess capital position. You know, at the holdco, it got a lot stronger with a big dividend, it seems, in 4Q, and then you're projecting it to get better in 2024. So, just thought maybe you could give us, you know, high level, what are the priorities there."", ""You've outlined share repurchases and, you know, we know where dividends are. It looks like around half a billion. After that, it's sort of not earmarked. So, what -- you know, what are the priorities for using that?"", 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. Thanks, Alex. Just to take you back -- everyone back, we mentioned a couple of times, but the capital generation this year was very very strong. We see it continuing as we go forward.', ""And we ended the year in a very good capital position as we've been building that throughout 2023. So, first of all, start there. Second is, you know, last year, our priority was -- was putting more money behind long-term care and funding that level, of funding up the PDR. And so, that was accomplished, and I think that leaves us in a good spot, as we've talked about, no more money going toward long-term care."", ""And so, then we think about the deployment opportunities we have in 2024, I'd start out first with putting it right back in our core businesses, investing in the digital capabilities we talked about. From an organic perspective, that's contemplated in our earnings, as we talked about that, as we fund internal initiatives. And we'd like to look at M&A to help how do we continue to accelerate that growth rate. Capabilities, things that surround our business, whether it's distribution, product, internal capabilities, we'll continue to look at."", ""And when you do all of those different things, we then look at our -- how we'll deploy it back to our shareholders. Steve mentioned, our dividend expectation even ticked up a little bit that 10% to 15% range this year and share repurchase, which is double where it was a year ago at 500 million. Keep doing all of that, we still have building capital levels, and we'll have to contemplate that over time what we want to do with that. These are different trend lines that we're on from a generation, as well as from a deployment perspective."", ""And so, we'll be thoughtful in 2024 about how we do that. I think Steve articulated on one of his slides and mentioned, you know, we're going to be dynamic with share repurchase. So, it's not something we're putting out there today. But clearly, as you said, we're in a much -- much higher level of capital that we've seen over time."", ""And we have lots of lots of potential uses for it. Nothing particular that we have today; it will build. But we'd love to use some of that capital to deploy to grow our business faster. And then, if we don't see that opportunity, to -- to turn it back to our shareholders."", 'Alex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Got it. Very helpful. And then, I wanted to go back to some of the comments, you know, you're making on being fully funded on LTC. I guess when I look at the one side, that's got the bullet on, you know, reserves peaking in 10 years, and there's -- you know, I know you've talked in the past about the natural sort of, you know, higher required capital is that reserve level builds. If we think through where interest rates are right now and sort of the billion in change of PDR balance coming down, is -- you know, is that enough to be fully funded just, you know, for, like, some finite period of time? Or when you were looking at that reserve build and then getting over the peak of it is -- is it really that your base case is that you're actually projecting at this point that you'll never have to fund it ever again? I mean, I just want to understand what you mean by being fully funded and if that's changed at all."", 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, this is Steve. So, I would separate. When we say fully funded in those statements, that -- that's specific to, in 2023, we fully recognized the PDR and we downstreamed capital, OK? If I look forward, though, and we look at current interest rates and we look at our current best estimate assumptions that, you know, we do believe that that will be kind of self-contained funding for all the required capital that would be needed for the build of those reserves over the next 10 years. And then, once you get beyond that, you know, those reserves will start to release, which will start to release some of the required capital behind that as well."", ""So, you know, right now, with our current projections, we do take a longer-term view that we're not going to need to contribute capital to fund long-term care."", 'Alex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is open.', 'Suneet Kamath -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Thanks. Good morning. Just starting with long-term care, Rick, you had mentioned this, I think, in your opening comments about, you know, pursuing risk transfer. Obviously, the environment is dynamic.', 'We saw a transaction late last year. Other companies have talked about bid-ask coming in. So, can you just give us a sense maybe where you are in that process, what the conversations are like? Has there been a change given some of the actions that you took last year, as well as the rate environment?', 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. Thanks, Suneet. Just a couple of comments. One, you mentioned the transaction that happened last year.', ""It was good to see it was a positive development, I think, after many years what we've been talking about it, but you hadn't seen anything in the market. So, I'd just articulate a positive development. If you look at the transaction that was done, it's very consistent with how we've been talking about it in terms of, you know, parsing out certain risks within our block, taking on different things, finding the right counterparty. All of those are things that we've been talking about what a transaction might look like."", ""You know, for us, our message is very consistent around that. So, we have the ability to -- to work with counterparties to do that, to parse out different things. The bid-ask spread that we look at, you know, and when that closes, we'll -- we'll be looking at a transaction. We're not there in terms of what we've seen out there, but we're going to stay very active in the markets."", ""And I think that, you know, we'll look forward to more buyers meeting sellers. But I don't think there's a change in our tone overall from a market perspective, but we're very happy to see that positive development happen in the market. So, hopefully, that answered it. You know, I think our messaging will be very consistent."", ""The only thing that's different is something has happened in the market, and that's -- that's a good thing."", 'Suneet Kamath -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Got it. That makes sense. And then, I guess as we think about your capital plans for 2024 and, in particular, that slide that looked at, you know, where you expect to be at year-end '24, I think all measures are higher than where you ended 2023. And so, I guess the question is, is there a thought there around maybe holding back on some of the capital deployment in anticipation of some sort of transaction with respect to LTC? Is that part of the capital philosophy at the company?"", 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""It's really not. When we think of a potential transaction out there, we think we -- before this year, we had plenty of capital to do it. Steve had it on his slides. We have a lot of debt capacity as well."", ""So -- so, I really would take that out of it. We're not earmarking any of those excess funds we're talking about for any particular use. We'd love to see it in terms of a good M&A transaction. If something could happen in LTC, that would be good as well."", ""But we're not holding back any funds, you know, waiting for a transaction to happen. We've got the flexibility, the capacity to do something even as we stood -- even as we stand today or as we project out over the course of the year."", 'Suneet Kamath -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Got it. OK, thanks.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from a line of Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.', 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning. So, first, I have a question on competition in the disability market. If you look at margins for you guys, for most of your peers, they've been very strong. So, just wondering why you haven't seen competition pick up or -- because I would have normally -- normally thought that with margins being as strong as they are, you would have seen prices come down a lot on 1/1 renewals."", ""And it doesn't seem like they've moved down as much."", 'Chris Pyne -- Executive Vice President, Group Benefits', ""First, yeah, thanks for the question, Jimmy. You know, competition's always out there, that's for sure. But I would take you back to some of the things that we do both from a capabilities perspective and from, you know, a claims management perspective. So, again, our customers are buying a broader experience from us."", ""I'll give you an example from MyUnum. Smaller customers who are looking for completely integrated set of products that work really well from an administration standpoint, an enrollment standpoint, we've got the right contracts and cover, so they get really high-quality insurance. And of course, that ultimately ends up in, you know, a wonderful claims experience. Going upmarket, HR Connect is a great example where, you know, somebody's buying our products because of deep integration with, you know, leading HCM platforms like ADP's Workforce Now, Workday, and UKG."", ""And then, again, if somebody buys the Total Leave package from us, you know, they're looking for us to solve a very significant challenge with claims administration and compliance, leaves management. You know, with that comes great insurance products. We've got a phenomenal claim team behind those products that do a wonderful job to make sure we pay exactly what we should pay and do it with great care and compassion. We do a great job getting people back to work."", ""And incidents has been favorable in the current environment, which we expect to continue. So, you put that whole thing together and -- and, you know, we -- we, again -- I go back to where I started the conversation around strong discipline underwriting. We've got a very kind of logical way to kind of describe fair price in that environment, and it's generating strong returns. And again, this has been for a period of time, and we expect it to continue."", 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. And then, just following up on you've made a few comments on M&A. And in the past, you've done a few smaller-type deals. What is it that you're looking for ideally in -- in terms of M&A? And would you be interested in sort of larger deals as well, or should we assume a consistent approach to what you've done in the past?"", 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I think the assumption would be a consistent approach. I think we're looking at, not necessarily to go far afield, but to build our positions. We have -- we have opportunities to do that. There's some -- some areas we'd like to continue to build out across the franchise across the world on that front."", ""But, you know, when you think about other bigger transactions that do basically what we're doing today, we're going to be very very selective, and we're going to -- because we think we have the opportunity to grow it organically. So, hopefully, that gives you a sense. We were very happy with the transaction we've done, you know, although it's been a couple of years since -- since we've done one, but we're going to be out there in the markets continuing to look at what makes sense for us and, most importantly, what's on strategy."", 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'OK, thanks.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.', 'Tom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Good morning. Just -- just a few on long-term care. First, is the elevated claim frequency versus your expectation, I'm solving for around 3% to 4% elevated, does that sound about right to you, or would you adjust that figure?"", 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, you know, you probably don't want to specifically attribute the impact of claims incidents to the loss ratio. I think what I take you back to is just the net premium ratio and really thinking about if our actual performance is equal to the expectations built into our reserve, we should have a loss ratio of around 95%. And clearly, claims incidence has been elevated over the last several quarters. And so, you know, you've seen NPR creep up just a little bit, and historically, you've seen higher-than-expected loss ratios."", ""But that's probably the best way to -- to think about it, Tom. And in my -- my comments, I did say, you know, we expect that elevation to continue some into 2024 and then, you know, dissipate over time."", 'Tom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Thanks -- thanks, Steve. But just directionally, I just want to make sure we're not talking about elevated incidents of double digits that with what you're seeing on the claims front, it's -- it's less than that. Is that, you know, even -- you know, not looking for a specific number, just want to know, directionally, are we talking about a big -- big change in incidence or not?"", 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, again, I -- going into next year, I -- we don't anticipate it getting worse than what we've seen in the back half of the year. And the loss ratio that we reported during those periods of time were around, you know, 105, 107. So, I wouldn't see it going beyond that, but you know, we just have to see how it plays out in the future."", 'Tom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Got you. And the second question, just the higher level of resubmission of claims that you were highlighting, can you talk about -- maybe unpack that a little bit what -- what's happening exactly? Were there lower acceptance rates before? How does that process work? And that -- this sounds like there's a little bit of an inventory on the resubmission of claims. But if you -- if you can just expand on that."", 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah, I mean resubmission is going to happen in a lot of ways. You know, we start to track the claim pretty early on in the submission process, and so a lot of things can happen: People can withdraw the claim; we can close the claim before it starts to pay; it may go to pay status, but it recovers very quickly. And that happens for a variety of reasons. So, some of it, around us accepting the claim and approving the claim.', ""Some of it may be policyholder-driven that they've changed their mind around the claim submission and come off a claim. What I would just say, though, is we have seen a higher level of that than we've historically seen. And it's something that we track, but it does -- it does create a little bit of pressure in kind of our expected incidence counts over time."", 'Tom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Got you. And then, just one final one on risk transfer. I guess one prominent feature of the MFC deal was their willingness to package some other risks along with LTC. And, you know, there's -- again, this is just my opinion, but I believe that expanded the number of reinsurers willing to get involved."", ""Is that -- would you guys -- I think the way you've talked about it in the past was an LTC-only deal, not really packaging other risks. But if it allowed you to get something done, do you have the ability and would you consider packaging other risks along with LTC?"", 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, Tom, the way I'd answer that is we've talked about how buyers can meet sellers in the process. And as we look at it, you know, we've talked to counterparties, and we've talked about it within the LTC block of how we would parse risks. Think about asset management aspects of that, think about liabilities. But certainly, we would be open to other things that buyers would be looking for around the franchise."", ""So, I don't -- I wouldn't take that off the table and we would have that opportunity."", 'Tom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, Rick.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is open.', 'Ryan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Hey, thanks. Good morning. First, just a quick follow-up. Is your expectation still that in 2024 you will earn within the 130 million to 160 million range in the closed block, you know, maybe toward the lower end? Or can you give any more color on kind of what you assumed for the earnings given the higher incidence that -- that you expect near term?', 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, it's in that range. And the two variables would be would be claims incidence and really the alternative asset portfolio. You know, we've -- we've assumed that we get back to kind of longer-term yields on that portfolio. And, as you know, that tends to be volatile quarter to quarter."", 'Ryan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Got it. And if I could ask, I guess, one more in risk transfer. You do have the -- the first Unum New York entity. It has, I think, a lot of older age long-term-care in it and -- and pretty conservative reserves due to the requirements in New York.', 'Is -- is selling the entire legal entity another option beyond -- you know, separate from reinsurance, or there are other liabilities in that entity that would prevent that from occurring?', 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I appreciate the question, Ryan. I'm not sure I'd want to get into too much details. I think I'd just go back to my earlier comments, which is we look at the entirety of our long-term care exposure and think about how we can parse those different risks in different ways. I wouldn't want to get into a legal entity or -- or even duration of specific things until we get closer to getting something done."", 'Ryan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'OK. And then, if I could maybe just sneak one last one. You talked broadly about the good environment for -- for renewables, but could you give us any more color on just the pricing dynamic in Unum U.S.? You know, were prices -- like, when you look at prices as a whole, were they relatively flat, or did you bring them down some for disability? Or can you give us any more sense of what happened there?', 'Chris Pyne -- Executive Vice President, Group Benefits', ""Yeah, thanks, Ryan. It's Chris. You know, we're constantly looking at different ways to kind of make sure we can grow in the most logical and profitable way possible. So, you know, it's really considerate just our active underwriting and pricing approach."", ""We're very thoughtful. We have tremendous data. We use it all the time to be as sharp as we possibly can. We recognize trends are early, and that goes into, you know, what I would consider business as usual in terms of, you know, thinking about price at the case level, thinking about price, you know, in different segments where we see opportunity."", ""So, it is a competitive world. We have growth expectations that we're really excited about. We're certain we can deliver, and we'll continue to kind of take that active approach to the process."", 'Ryan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Great.

You guys touched on it, but I would like to confirm if 1.4 billion to 1.6 billion of annual capital generation is a good run rate beyond '24. Is there some risk to that level as disability results normalize?"", 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, it's Steve. I can take that. I think that's a good planning assumption. You know, obviously, over time, we'd like the franchise to continue to grow at some -- some rate that would be reflected, but I think I think that's a good run rate."", 'And that would anticipate, for 2024, the group disability loss ratio staying in the low 60s. Our planning assumptions for capital generation and for our GAAP, you know, earnings expectations would be consistent.', 'Wilma Burdis -- Raymond James -- Analyst', ""OK, thank you. And then, you have provided a new data point that LTC reserves are peaking in 10 years. That's sooner than I expected, especially on the group side. And it's a very good data point because it implies that we're a lot closer to knowing how reserves will develop than I initially anticipated."", 'Could you talk about, is this an average across the blocks? And if so, is there a different peak reserving timeline for the individual versus group blocks?', 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, so it would be an aggregate view of the total reserve just due to the age of the blocks. As you know, you would logically think that the individual will peak sooner than the group. I would say, though, the magnitude of the reserves that we carry on those two are a bit different just because of the relative size of -- or the relative richness of benefits for our group business versus our individual business. So, you know, there's a lot of weighted averaging going on, but in aggregate, that's when it's going to be."", 'Wilma Burdis -- Raymond James -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Wilma.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your line is open.', 'Josh Shanker -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Yeah, hi there. Sorry, one last transaction question, apologies. But, you know, you mentioned that it's been a number of years, and things lined up properly, the interest rate situation is changing. Do you think there were unique circumstances on the ground that allowed a transaction to come together? Or are you currently seeing an appetite that the people are discussing wanting to do transactions, just the matter of finding the right one for you?"", 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, so I wouldn't want to speculate. I don't know what was going on, particularly on the ground, with that transaction. I can look at it, just as you can, from afar and say that's a -- it's a positive development for the -- for the industry and for people that are looking to do something on that front. And I would just say we have had very consistent dialogue, very consistent outreach expectations parsing."", ""So. I don't think our world has necessarily changed as a result of that, but -- but I think it's good for the world to see that these transactions can happen, and -- and we'll continue to pursue such a transaction."", 'Josh Shanker -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'All my other questions were asked.

Your line is open.', 'Mark Hughes -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""Yeah, thank you. Just one quick one. Anything nonrecurring in the recoveries? Recoveries have been very strong. We've heard from other companies that the Social Security Administration has been kind of stingy in their payouts."", ""I know that's only a part of your recovery story, but is that something that should be sustainable?"", 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, I can -- I can answer that, Mark. So, I would say that if you go back really several years, we have seen a continued improvement in the performance of recoveries within our group disability block. And so, what we're seeing in the more recent history is just a continuation of that. And so, I would not view the performance in the fourth quarter as being in any way unique or non-sustainable."", ""And that's why we feel pretty comfortable giving guidance going into next year that we'll be able to maintain those levels of benefit ratios that not only to the market dynamics that Chris spoke to around pricing, but also just around our operational excellence and being able to maintain that level of performance."", 'Mark Hughes -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""You know, maybe I'll throw in one more. The Colonial sales are pretty strong this quarter, up 12%. You talked about high single digits. Was there an unusual boost or easy comp this quarter?"", 'Tim Arnold -- Head, Colonial Life and Voluntary Benefits Business', ""Yeah, thank you for the question. This is Tim. I -- I would say the comps were not that easy, although they weren't extremely challenging either. But, you know, we feel good about where we landed the quarter and, frankly the year."", 'We think the market is growing in the 4% to 6% range, and we came at -- at the top end of the range. We -- we really like our strategy. We think we have the tools and technology to help our agents, brokers, and clients achieve their goals. We grew our sales leadership team by 8% last year.', ""And, you know, on the fourth -- on the third quarter call, I've mentioned that we are strengthening our offering in the large case commercial market. And while we still have a little bit of work to do there, we're really pleased that we saw fourth-quarter growth rate in the 500-plus life market at 36%. So, we're really just focused on consistency of execution and broad-based adoption of those differentiating tools and technology that we have in our portfolio. As we look forward, you know, a couple of the leading indicators we watch are new recruits and sales productivity from those new agents."", ""In the 2023, the total recruiting was up 23% and new agent sales were up 18%. And since all of you have been sneaking in one last question, I'll answer a question you didn't ask. But we saw really strong growth on the Unum BB side of 10.2% last year. We're excited about the opportunities we have to cross-sell into the group block and to take advantage of those technology solutions that Chris mentioned earlier and grow that book as well."", 'Mark Hughes -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'I appreciate it. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ward from Citi. Your line is open.', 'Mike Ward -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just quickly, I was wondering if you had any kind of similar commentary on the benefit ratio guidance quantification-type range for AD&D and -- or, you know, supplemental and voluntary, like -- like you gave for group disability.', 'Steve Zabel -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, this -- this is Steve, I can cover that. And maybe, you know, I'll go across all the businesses. We've talked about group disability quite a bit. I might just touch on group life."", ""Group life had a very good quarter in the fourth quarter, which we do not believe is sustainable. So, I think a good planning assumption there would be more in that 73% to 75% range. And then, for really all of our other lines, including the ones that you mentioned, I would just go back to the guidance that we gave last year and where those businesses have historically performed. I think that's probably a pretty good indicator of our view of how they're going to perform going forward."", 'Mike Ward -- Citi -- Analyst', ""OK, thanks, Steve. And then, maybe for -- for capital return for '24, you know, it sounds like there is some excess there, or you know, capital left over. Just curious, like, let's say you don't, you know, come across any acquisition opportunities or bolt-on, what have you, should we think about potential upside to that, or should we think of that as, like, a realistic, like, straight-line guidance for the year?"", 'Rick McKenney -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I think, Mike, the way I look at it is kind of how Steve said it, it'll be dynamic. So, we don't just set a plan and set it and forget it. We actually will be back at it all the time.

Is that -- is that why there was a -- the shift, or something else happening there?', 'Chris Pyne -- Executive Vice President, Group Benefits', ""Yeah, thanks for the question, Tom. It's Chris. Actually, it's a -- it's a good call. We saw some great opportunity in group life packaged with -- a lot of what's packaged with current customers."", 'So, always nice to add a life insurance in that environment. We actually did have more strength in the disability sales line than it would appear. Full-year sales were up 14%.

So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."", 'Robert A. Bruggeworth', ""Thanks, Doug, and welcome, everyone, to Qorvo's Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Call. I would like to start by complementing the team for delivering another solid quarter. The demand environment in the December quarter improved versus our November outlook, and this is reflected in our strong performance. Looking at our business from a high level, Qorvo is capitalizing on secular trends, including connectivity, sustainability and electrification. These trends are playing out over many years, and they are fueling the transition to new technologies and new standards like 5G Advanced, WiFi 7, Matter, DOCSIS 4.0 and others. As a result, customers across our businesses are increasingly seeking higher levels of efficiency and performance where performance is measured in power out, talk time or time between charges. Qorvo is central to these transitions, and we are critical to enabling these capabilities. We leverage unique competitive strengths to supply our customers best-in-class solutions that enhance efficiency, increase throughput and reduce form factor. We are a preferred supplier with leading products and a robust technology road map, and we are positioned favorably for broad-based growth across our 3 operating segments. Now let's turn to our strategic highlights, beginning with HPA. Customer demand in end markets, excluding base station, is improving and supports our view for a return to year-over-year growth in HPA in the March quarter. In defense and aerospace, we won an X-band radar design with a major DoD contractor, and we received new standard product orders in support of several large domestic and international ground-based radar systems. We also enjoyed increasing demand for our solid-state PA products and for our switch filter bank products across multiple customers and programs. There are multiyear secular trends driving our D&A business, including the trend of one to many and the transition of mechanical systems to active electronic scanning systems, both of which increased requirements for more advanced systems level RF solutions. Earlier today, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Boston-based Anokiwave. Anokiwave is a leading supplier of high-performance integrated silicon ICs for intelligent active array antennas. We are excited to have the Anokiwave team join Qorvo and expand our offerings for defense and aerospace, SATCOM and 5G applications. In power management, we are extending our reach in markets where Qorvo enjoys a strong presence such as wearables and other consumer products. Our most recent award is a PMIC chipset with multiple placements for a wearable and charger at a leading Android OEM. Complementing this, we've begun to see a rebound in SSPs for PC and enterprise markets. We are continuing to expand upon our strong position with an additional power management win in support of a leading manufacturer of laptops. Lastly, our recently launched QSPICE circuit simulation software was honored as the Design Tool and Development Software Product of the Year at the 2023 Elektra awards. In power devices, we are shipping into power supplies for blockchain applications, and design activity in data center continues to be strong. We are also seeing increased activity in circuit protection where our JFET technology brings unique advantages. In automotive, design activity remains strong not only for onboard chargers but also for other emerging applications and electric vehicles. In infrastructure, Qorvo is leading the DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade cycle. We commenced volume shipments of our newest DOCSIS 4.0 hybrid power doubler in support of multiple cable OEMs. In the cellular base station market, inventories continue to be consumed, and we expect demand conditions to remain soft through calendar year '24. Turning to CSG. Customer activity for ultra-wideband is increasing in secure access automotive applications. We are also seeing new applications for ultra-wideband in automotive, including presence detection and other radar-based sensors. This momentum builds upon our recent wins in ultra-wideband, including an in-vehicle car access platform and a flagship Android smartphone launch. As we demonstrated at CES we are actively involved in a wide array of enterprise and connected home solutions leveraging Matter and ultra-wideband for applications such as door locks, smart lighting and indoor navigation. In force-sensing touch sensors, we received first production orders for an automotive supplier in support of a leading Korea-based automotive OEM. We are seeing increasing traction across a growing set of customers and markets, including automotive, laptop track pads, wearables and smart health. In WiFi, design activity and collaboration remains strong across reference designs, customers and operators. Within the Android ecosystem, the demand environment for mobile WiFi is improving with the normalization of Android channel inventories. In access points, WiFi 6 volumes continue to grow with certain providers' rollouts in India. In WiFi 7, Qorvo secured design wins across operator, retail, enterprise and mobile segments. In ACG, we commenced shipments in support of the spring 2024 flagship smartphone launch by the leading Android smartphone OEM. On our last earnings call, we highlighted our content gains in the flagship tier. In addition to the ultra-wideband, Qorvo content this year includes the low-band, mid/high band, ultra-high band, secondary transmit and receive, tuning and WiFi. We are ramping up now and building upon our momentum with a broad set of design wins in this customer's high-volume mass market portfolio. Android mass-market smartphones are set to transition to 5G through the decade. In our collaboration with Android customers on their long-term product road maps positions Qorvo to be a primary beneficiary as these new 5G units enter our SAM. To that end, Qorvo was recognized by the top 4 China-based Android 5G OEMs with 2023 awards for innovation, quality, supply, technology and strategic partnership. To simplify 5G adoption and sustain our position as the leading global strategic supplier to Android OEMs, we continue to launch new architectures and new products that enhance performance and reduce form factors. During the quarter, we expanded customer sampling of our newly launched main path LMH PAD. This highly integrated solution is optimized for mass-market smartphones. It combines in a single placement the low, mid- and high-band main path content traditionally offered in 2 placements. This reduces surface area by 40%, simplifies design and accelerates time to market. In addition to developing highly integrated solutions with increasing levels of functional density, we are also advancing technology in our high-performance discrete portfolio, including our BAW filters. During the quarter, we received purchase orders for discrete BAW filters using our recently released next-generation BAW technology. During the quarter, we continued to bring channel inventories down, and our shipments are more closely aligned with end market demand. We are also seeing incremental improvement in end market demand in the Android ecosystem. For calendar '24, we expect total smartphone units to grow in low single digits, with 5G units growing over 10%. The competing wins, we collaborate with customers on their 3-year product road maps, and we supply the industry-leading solutions. We enjoy a position as the preferred strategic RF supplier for all the customers we serve in the Android space and we are very well positioned to benefit as their portfolios continue to transition to 5G. In summary, demand for Qorvo's products has improved primarily due to our proactive efforts to align channel inventories with end market demand and content gains on key customer programs. We are delivering customers industry-leading products and technologies and design activity remains robust. This positions Qorvo favorably for continued strong content and durable long-term growth. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Grant."", 'Grant A. Brown', ""Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $1.74 billion, non-GAAP gross margin was 43.8% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.10, all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range.

As communicated last quarter, ACG achieved year-over-year growth in September, CSG achieved year-over-year growth during the September quarter and we expect HPA to achieve strong year-over-year growth in the March quarter. Regarding gross margin, a larger portion of December revenue was manufactured internally during periods of lower utilization, which led to higher unit costs compared to the September quarter. Factory utilization is improving and the impact from underutilization and factory-related variances continues to moderate. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $234 million. We continue to invest in new product development as it is a critical catalyst for driving multiyear growth across all 3 business segments. Alongside these growth-oriented investments, we continue to launch productivity initiatives across the enterprise. These initiatives, also spanning multiple years, are designed to support future growth, augment productivity and enhance profitability. In total, non-GAAP operating income in the quarter was $237 million or 22% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $206 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $2.10. Turning to the cash flow statement. We're pleased to report that during the December quarter, we generated free cash flow of $467 million, setting a new quarterly record for Qorvo. Our capital expenditures for the period were $26 million, and we repurchased approximately $100 million of stock at $94 per share. The rate and pace of our share repurchases considers several factors, including our long-term financial outlook, free cash flow, debt maturities, alternative uses of cash and other relevant strategic considerations. This approach ensures that our capital allocation strategy balances future growth with the return of capital and aligns with our underlying goal of delivering long-term shareholder value. On the balance sheet, as of quarter end, we had approximately $1.6 billion of long-term debt outstanding and over $1 billion of cash and equivalents. Regarding balance sheet presentation, the 2024 notes have been reclassified as current and will mature in December. Subject to changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, we currently expect to retire these notes later this year. In line with the expectations shared during our previous earnings call, we successfully reduced our net inventory balance over the period. We ended the quarter with a net inventory balance of $727 million, a sequential decrease of $113 million. In terms of days of inventory, this represents a decrease from 138 days in the September quarter to 118 days in the December quarter. This reduction reflects our commitment to efficient inventory management and we expect continued improvement in the March quarter. Turning to the current quarter outlook. We expect revenue of approximately $925 million, plus or minus $25 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 42% and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.20 at the midpoint of the revenue range. Relative to December, we expect March revenue to reflect a larger percentage of higher cost inventories previously manufactured internally during periods of lower utilization. As these higher-cost, previously manufactured inventories sell through, it paves the way for future gross margins that reflect increasing levels of utilization. We currently expect to have sold through most of these higher-cost inventories and associated costs by the second half of this calendar year. We project non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter will be approximately $245 million with variability related to labor-related expenses and the timing of program development spend. Below the operating income line, nonoperating expense is expected to be approximately $10 million, reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses, along with other items. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal '24 is expected to be within a range of 11% to 13%. In December, we announced a new partnership with Luxshare related to the divestiture of our Beijing and Dezhou assembly and test facilities. Upon the closing of this transaction, Luxshare will acquire each facility's operations and assets, which includes the property, plant and equipment as well as the existing workforce, to enable the seamless continuity of operations. Qorvo will continue to maintain our sales, product and test engineering and customer support employees in China. We believe that adding Luxshare as a strategic partner will strengthen our position to serve our customers globally. As it relates to our manufacturing strategy, this is a further step in our ongoing efforts to reduce capital intensity. This move aligns with previous actions, including the closure of our Florida manufacturing operations and the recent sale of our Farmers Branch facility in Texas. We are efficiently managing a complex supply chain, including our internal factories, which support all 3 operating segments, and will remain an ongoing focus. We will leverage internal manufacturing where it uniquely differentiates our products and outsource production where we maintain a strong network of foundry and OSAT partners. Qorvo is well positioned to capitalize on multiple growth drivers within each of our 3 operating segments. We are confident that our investments in our technology portfolio, product development and advanced manufacturing will broaden our addressable market, diversify revenue, expand margins and accelerate growth. At this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs."", 'Toshiya Hari', ""I had two questions. The first one on content growth for this year. Bob, obviously, you guys did a really good job last year in gaining content not only at your largest customer but across the board. I know it's a little bit early but curious how you're thinking about your potential to grow content this year, again, at the largest customer as well as on the Android side. You gave great color on your Korea-based customer but curious how you're thinking about the year across the board."", 'Robert A. Bruggeworth', ""Toshiya, thanks for your question. And it does seem that some reports last night have created some confusion about our business, so I think it's best I go ahead and address it now that you gave me the opportunity with your first question. Based on our known design wins and engagements with our largest customer, one of our competitors, I think it's been named, Qualcomm, we don't believe they're competing on any of the sockets we're engaged in. They did not win any sockets that we've been in nor do we see them challenging our share in any of the sockets we're competing for or investing in at our largest customer. In fact, you can ask them, we're quite confident they would tell you the same thing. Now specifically to ultra-high band, we made it clear on past calls, it was a multisource socket, and we were the only company that consistently won over the last 3 years. We've never had 100% share of the ultra-high band. In fact, you can look at Teradyne on the latest iPhone and see Qorvo won the ultra-high band in the Pro and Pro Max models. I know I've said and many of our teams said consistently that this is a performance-driven customer, and we're winning based on multiyear engagements, our technology investments and clearly, our product performance. And we expect to grow with our largest customer in FY '25 and grow even more in FY '26. I wish I could give you more specifics, but I think that answers your question, Toshiya."", 'Toshiya Hari', ""Yes. I appreciate the color. And then as my follow-up, one for Grant on the gross margin side. I think 3 months ago, you had shared the underutilization charge of, I think, 550 basis points for the September quarter. Curious what the headwind was in December, what's embedded in your March quarter guidance. And more importantly, as you progress through the year, how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins? And sorry, one last one. The Luxshare deal, how should we think about that potentially benefiting gross margins medium to long term?"", 'Grant A. Brown', ""Sure, Toshiya. Let me try and take all of those in order. So the first one in terms of the impact from the underutilization charges, it's about half, maybe a little less than half, of what we had previously reported. And as I pointed out, we'll be working through those higher-cost inventories over the balance of this year and should clear them in the second half. So that should give you a sense of the timing there. There's a lot of moving factors that influence gross margin in addition to underutilization, so the timing of where something was built, when it was built and then in any given period when it's sold. In the September quarter, for example, we had a relatively high percentage of product mix that was manufactured at external silicon foundries and then processed at third-party OSATs versus a higher percentage in the December and what we anticipate in March to be manufactured internally during prior periods of lower utilization. So there's this lag effect I described last quarter. The underutilization in past periods, obviously, converting the products sold in future periods. But beyond March, no change to our guidance of returning to 50% plus gross margin over time. We have line of sight to get there once we sell through the higher-cost inventories, as I mentioned, it's encouraging on the utilization front as it's improving, and we'll continue to execute on further productivity opportunities as well. I commented in my prepared remarks that we expect to have worked through all of that, as I mentioned, in the second half, and that will clear the path for margins that reflect higher levels of factory utilization going forward."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel.', 'Ruben Roy', ""Bob, first of all, on the unit assumptions that you have for the year, low single digits, I think you said, for the total market; and then 5G, 10% or so. How are you thinking about sort of non-China Android and China Android as you think about your mix going forward? It would seem like you're doing quite well, obviously, in Korea and elsewhere. Just wondering kind of where you think things shake out with China Android as you kind of progress through calendar '24."", 'David Fullwood', ""Thanks for the question. This is Dave. I'll take that one. So as Bob mentioned and as we said before, we enjoy a really strong position as the preferred strategic supplier for all our Android customers. We engage with them on multiple years out on their product road maps. And it's really a special seat at the table that we have as the leading global supplier. They care deeply about our products, our technology, but also the quality and the supply assurance that we deliver. And we've been that trusted supplier for all of our Android customers for many, many years. And the one thing we've learned is you have to be there for them over the long term. You can't just come in and out of the market and expect to gain any meaningful share. So at our China customers, as Bob mentioned, we received top supplier awards for innovation, quality, supply, strategic partnership for 2023, and that includes awards from Honor, OPPO, Xiaomi and Vivo. And we're also proud of our position in Android outside of China as well. Bob highlighted the great content in the new Samsung Galaxy S24. For multiple years now, we provide a full lineup of ultra-high band, mid/high band, secondary transmit path, low-band, tuning and WiFi. And this year, we added ultra-wideband. We're also excited to have received initial purchase orders for our next-generation mid/high band with integrated diversity receive. We announced that product a few quarters ago, and we had our first purchase orders for a U.S.-based Android customer. And this part brings a new level of integration for size and performance, leveraging our latest filter technology for BAW and SAW. And we've also got a lot of other great content on that phone that we're excited to tell you about in the future as well. We believe we're best positioned to grow with our Android customers as their products continue to transition to 5G over the coming years. And we've got a lot of great new opportunities and content we can address with ultra-wideband touch sensors and power management, so we feel really good about our position really across the entire Android ecosystem."", 'Ruben Roy', ""That's great. A quick follow-up for Grant on the Luxshare commentary. How are you thinking, Grant, about sort of longer-term CapEx? Clearly, this is part of sort of the longer-term strategy around CapEx. But if you could speak to that, I know the deal is going to close first half of '24, so maybe a little bit early. But has anything changed, I guess, with the strategy around CapEx and cash flow assumptions that you have as you think about sort of the next 12 to 18 months?"", 'Grant A. Brown', ""Sure. The cash flow question, I think as we look forward, as I've always said, we'll follow the P&L. So largely, that will be dictated by the growth that Bob mentioned in fiscal '25 and '26. In terms of our CapEx, as a percentage of the top line, we do expect it to continue in that 5% or less category. If there are capacity additions made, it will be in response to demand and the capacity required to serve it. As it relates to the sale of Beijing and Dezhou, we're really excited to partner with Luxshare as we transition those sites. The agreement is over multiple years. And there is obviously some benefits there for Qorvo as the volume increases, and we found a great partner to help reduce our capital intensity, and we're confident in their ability to provide the cost improvements that we'd expect over time in a rather similar relationship to what we incurred today cost-wise at those locations."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.', 'Edward Francis Snyder', ""A couple of things. Bob, thank you very much for clearing that up right off the bat. I really appreciate that. That clears a lot of confusion. Maybe we can shift gears then a little bit on the Android market. I know you're doing very well in China and the whole inventory digestion, and that's all, I think, fairly clear now. But when you get back to the normal run rate here, the content gain seems to be shifted a little bit. The Chinese suppliers have picked up a little bit, but they don't seem to be threatening you in modules. And now you're talking about these very high integrated modules, which separates you from any other competitors. I don't think Skyworks even has that part yet. So one, content-wise, by combining all that into a single module, it must be the sum of the parts isn't quite equal to the individual pieces. Is it a content decline just on average? Or are you pulling in content that they may not have had before or they're paying for a premium? So I'm just trying to get an idea of how that shakes out when China finally gets back to a normal run rate. And then I had a follow-up, please."", 'David Fullwood', ""Yes, this is Dave. It kind of depends. So Bob mentioned our low, mid/high. And so that's a combination of what used to be the mid/high band, which we generally enjoyed a pretty high share of that. And the low-band, which we had good share, but we shared a lot of that with some other competitors. But when we integrate the low, mid/high altogether, obviously, we can pick up some content there overall as we support customers with that platform. You also have to look at the different SKU strategies that our customers have. So depending on what markets they serve, there may be more or less filter content. So we work with them, as Bob mentioned and I mentioned as well, on their long-term road maps to help architect, to support their solutions across those different tiers. So whether they're doing a global SKU or they're doing regional SKUs, we can tier the product along with that to fit the needs that they have there."", 'Edward Francis Snyder', ""Great. And then if I could, you historically haven't sold discrete filters in quite a long time, if I can remember. I know you're doing it now. Well, first of all, maybe you can give us some idea of where those are going. Is that mostly into WiFi? I mean, who, where, what? And is it driven mostly by the fact that you have capacity in Texas that could support that, whereas you're not seeing maybe as much bond in some of the modules that you did it before? Yes, let's just deal with that one."", 'David Fullwood', ""Yes. It's an interesting one. So we've been in the discrete filter market. It's just not been a huge business for us because we focus more on the modules, as you said. But it's a very good performing module. It is for 5G, not for WiFi. And I'd like to use an example, customers, even in that tier of the market, are paying for performance, right? They want the latest and greatest technology from us. And even on a very base product like a discrete filter, they're still looking for performance. So we're pretty excited about those products."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.', 'Karl Ackerman', ""Two, if I may. A question first for Grant. With shutdowns in your Florida facility, which I believe was historically SAW, and the sale of Farmers Branch but also expansion of your Richardson facility, I guess why wouldn't gross margins exceed 50% on a lower revenue base than the prior peak as 5G unit volumes continue to grow from here?"", 'Grant A. Brown', ""Sure. So those are all productivity enhancements. And then as we've talked about, it's largely a function of utilization. So in addition to just shuttering some of those facilities that you mentioned, we're also producing significantly smaller die. And so we have effective capacity that has grown regardless of the number of wafers. So you can get more die out of a given wafer. So there's productivity there. And I would say there's a lot of productivity opportunities for us looking forward as we work into that across the board. So there's productivity initiatives that we still have to do. And in terms of why we haven't achieved 50%, it's again largely a utilization issue."", 'Karl Ackerman', ""Sure. I guess, Bob, you also mentioned that 5G units would grow over 10% this calendar year. I'm curious if that is done predominantly in midrange across maybe the China Android OEMs or is that only from Korean and U.S. OEMs? If you could give us some color on the constitution of the 5G unit growth in calendar '24, that would be very helpful."", 'Robert A. Bruggeworth', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Karl. It's primarily the Android ecosystem, so it would include all the Android manufacturers. Because we're seeing in China, the manufacturers that are not [HBOX] are also moving into 5G. So it's a broad comment across the Android ecosystem is what we see driving most of that growth."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James.', 'Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri', ""I guess on your March quarter outlook, pretty solid guide, by the way. Bob, just trying to understand the puts and takes by different segments. I think you said HPA is going to grow nicely in March quarter, which seems to imply that the smartphone business is probably seasonal. But based on what you said, it looks like Android is coming back a bit and your content is increasing. So I'm just curious as to why it's not better than seasonal as we look into the March quarter?"", 'Grant A. Brown', ""Sure. Hey, Srini, this is Grant. I'll take that question. We don't guide specifically by segment, but our views are incorporated in the total guidance. I'll give a bit of color on each. In ACG, we expect substantial year-on-year growth despite the typical sequential decline associated with our largest customer's fall ramp. Partially offsetting that seasonal decline is healthier channel inventories and improving smartphone unit demand in China as well as the flagship launch by our largest Android customer. In HPA, we also expect year-over-year growth across all the businesses, except base station. From a mix perspective, the more capital-intensive end markets we serve, such as base station and some others, including infrastructure, faced headwinds due to the interest rate sensitivity of those customers and some of those larger build-outs. Consequently, defense and aerospace now represents over half of the HPA top line, making that segment a bit more sensitive to the timing of some of those defense programs quarter-to-quarter. In CSG, we also expect year-over-year growth in the March quarter supported by our WiFi revenues, which we've talked about. It will be up meaningfully from Q4 last fiscal year. And then slower-than-expected ramps in IoT-related areas are expected in March, probably persisting through the first half of '24. Although the auto market appears to be weakening, in general, our secular opportunities there lie in the automotive connectivity areas, which are supported by the growing adoption of 5G WiFi, VDX and ultra-wideband, I think, Dave commented on earlier. We've already announced some significant design wins there in CSG for automotive and smartphone, and we're targeting additional areas, including industrial, enterprise and smartphone."", 'Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri', ""That's great color, Grant, I appreciate that. And then, Grant, cash flow, very, very strong here. Obviously, you had a little bit of a headwind in the first half with working capital. Now I think that has become a tailwind, but quite impressive nevertheless. So can you talk about how you're thinking about cash flow going forward? I think you mentioned CapEx is going to be fairly relatively small. And you also kind of suggested that inventory might come down again. So just want to hear your thoughts on cash flow generation going forward. And then what are the uses for the cash going forward? I guess, it looks like you made an acquisition and obviously, you've been buying back shares. So if you can talk about that, that would be helpful."", 'Grant A. Brown', ""Sure. In terms of cash flow next quarter, as you point out, there's a few puts and takes. I would expect CapEx to be up. That's going to follow the level of support for the top line and our capacity additions there for our customers' demand. So I would expect that to be up in the March quarter but remain on the year under our limit of around 5%, well under. The monetization of our receivables is something that I expect will continue. That's been a significant tailwind last quarter, along with the reduction in inventory balances. So now you're starting to see that come down as we're able to sell through inventories rather than purchase as much new material. So that helps cash flow. Looking forward, as I pointed out, rate and pace of our buyback will fluctuate. It's dependent this year on our maturing 2024 notes, which we'll look to take out by December. And then obviously, we'll be continuing to grow throughout the throughout the calendar year and into fiscal '25. So overall, we should see some improvement. But on a quarter-to-quarter basis in March, there are some additional items there."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.', 'Matthew D. Ramsay', ""I guess my question is trying to dovetail some expectations the market is increasingly having about AI adoption in clients or handset devices, particularly flagship ones, and dovetail that, Bob, with your commentary about visibility to maybe accelerating content gains for you with your large customer. What I'm trying to understand a bit more is, as AI, I guess, proliferates over the long term in the handset market, do you view that, in and of itself, as a driver of TAM or RF content for your company? Or is it more that the resources in the phone are going to get jacked up a lot in terms of compute and memory, et cetera, and that puts additional constraints on RF where your company can distinguish itself through R&D and taking out things like cost in board space and power, et cetera? I'm just trying to figure out what you see driving the visibility of content as AI presumably comes into these devices."", 'David Fullwood', ""Yes. This is Dave. It's early days, as you know, with AI, but it's pretty exciting. I think you hit on a lot of the key points already. I mean, definitely, it could be a catalyst that can help improve the replacement rate as people want to upgrade to take advantage of the new AI capabilities that show up in phones. It should drive more data over the network and that, of course, means more and better RF. And then as you pointed out, it's going to be more compute and processing power in the device, which is going to put more pressure on the rest of the phone. And so that, to us, translates into performance. And it could be in the RF and we can deliver better and better RF and lower power consumption to help solve those problems, but also we can deliver power management. And there's a lot of areas in the phone to address with power management that we can use our IP there to help, again, reduce current consumption, improve battery life and make more room to run the AI on the phone. But it's early, and so we have to see how this plays out. But definitely, we're looking forward to how AI can help drive the smartphone market further."", 'Matthew D. Ramsay', ""That's helpful. I guess, as my follow-up, and it's just a quick one, I know you guys didn't discuss financial terms or whatnot, but you did announce an acquisition today. If you could give us a little context around the technologies that you're bringing in, the people that you're bringing in, just any color there would be helpful."", 'Grant A. Brown', ""Thanks for the question, Matt. This is Grant. I'll take that one. We're really excited to bring the Anokiwave team onboard here at Qorvo. They bring a highly experienced talent in RF silicon antenna and phased array systems to our D&A group. The technology will complement our existing product portfolio of beamforming capabilities especially where we can leverage those with our advanced packaging capabilities. In terms of the deal, we didn't announce the terms, as you mentioned, but we do expect to close this quarter, and the impact is factored into our guidance. Initially, it will add revenue in the low single digits per quarter and be slightly dilutive to EPS but accretive to gross margin, and all that's factored into our guide."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.', 'Christopher Caso', ""I wonder if you could speak to seasonality for the rest of the year. And recognize that you only want to guide for one quarter, but I guess some of the inventory correction, certainly in the mobile business, looking like it's behind us is the expectation to kind of return to normal seasonal patterns. And then how does that apply to the nonmobile businesses, which I guess are still going through some degree of correction?"", 'Grant A. Brown', ""It's a little early to comment with any specificity on what would be our fiscal '25 or the balance of this calendar year largely. But absent any macro-related disruptions, as I pointed out, we do expect to grow and improve our gross margins year-on-year. It's worth pointing out that given the content gains and success we're having in our largest customer and the success in our defense and aerospace areas, our revenue seasonality will be more closely aligned to those customer programs and ramp profiles. So as we anticipate that quarterly profile or the shape of revenue across '25, we expect it to look very similar to '24. Beyond '25, we're proactively investing, focusing on diversifying our business, pursuing substantial customer platforms where we have the technology to win and the customer engagement to justify that product development."", 'Christopher Caso', ""That's helpful. As a follow-up to that, if you could speak to the CSG and HPA businesses. And could you give us perhaps an update on what you think are longer-term growth rates for those businesses? There's a lot of different moving parts in there. And I know through this correction, perhaps some of the expectations may have changed in that. What's your kind of outlook for those businesses as we look over the next 2 years or so?"", 'Grant A. Brown', ""This is Grant. I'll take that one, too. I would think of Qorvo as having a portfolio of diversified businesses that contribute to the revenue line. No change to our long-term growth metrics that we've commented on in the past. But if you decompose the business, about 2/3 of it is ACG, and this is primarily the smartphones and other cellular devices, including tablets and wearables that we've largely commented on already. The other 1/3 of our revenue is composed of our HPA and CSG businesses. And HPA, over half of that business, is now defense and aerospace. And then CSG, over half that business is WiFi currently. It hasn't always been the case. An HPA base station used to be significantly larger. Those have better than corporate gross margins typically. And so that's an area where we still have a lot of opportunity, but it's underrepresented in HPA at the time. Between HPA and CSG, there's smaller portfolio of businesses that range from $25 million to $75 million annually or so, and they address market opportunities in the $1 billion. So there's a lot of room to grow there, substantiating our comments on the strong double-digit growth rates. Our largest investments are aimed at very large customer programs, as I pointed out, in ACG for fiscal '25 and beyond. We're looking to scale our defense and power franchises within HPA, and we're building our UWB and Matter business in CSG. And all combined, this collection of businesses brings diversification and some financial resiliency. So it's rarely, if ever, all in phase. It's also interesting to note that in each of our operating segments, the largest businesses all benefit from our shared internal manufacturing capabilities. Our more nascent businesses rely on external capital. And over time, we expect to grow the less capital intensive simply because of the relative growth rates in those small businesses."", 'Operator', ""The next question is from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""I wanted to ask kind of a broader 30,000-foot view question on Huawei's entry into the Android market. Can you just talk about what your internal estimates are for the Huawei smartphone penetration in calendar year '24 and just how that impacts your outlook for Android, particularly as you get into the back half of the calendar year in '24?"", 'Robert A. Bruggeworth', 'Dave, we also had revenue, what we currently do.', 'David Fullwood', ""Yes, revenue is very low, near 0 or at 0 at this point with Huawei. But that's a good question. I think the performance of the phones that are out there, the newer ones, I think, is pretty widely known. People have done performance evaluations, and there's definitely some performance challenges on those phones. So we don't think that they could export them to other markets. They probably have a very difficult time getting carrier approval. So we think they're limited to China. And so if you look at their performance to date since the Mate 60 ramp, we think they did about $30 million in calendar year '23. If you take the last 4 months of data and you start to project that forward, you can see an incremental 10 million to 20 million units added in CY '24. So that's kind of how we're sizing it right now, and that's all built into our models. There was probably some pent-up demand from Huawei users. We'll have to see how that plays out and how sustainable that is. But in any case, any of those number of units is really not that significant when you think about a 1.2 billion unit smartphone market. So it's not that meaningful to us on a grand scale of things. And when we think about our China customers, the ones I mentioned earlier, they have pretty meaningful market shares also outside of China. And that's where a lot of the growth is coming from that Bob talked about as the market converts to 5G because most of China has already moved to 5G. So for us, we look at that as a great opportunity to work with those customers to continue to grow and as 5G comes into our market because we're really not present today in the 4G portion of the market."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""Helpful. And since that one was in your favor, I can give you a bit of a layup now. But just if you look at the competitive environment in Android at the high end, your competitor is talking about having a bit more capacity and maybe going after that market. Can you remind us of your competitive positioning there, particularly in BAW filters and why existing customers go with you? And if they were to enter the market, why do you think that you'd keep the share profile that you have today?"", 'David Fullwood', ""You're referring to the Android market?"", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", 'The Android market, yes.', 'David Fullwood', ""Yes. And I think I commented on this earlier. I mean we've been working with these customers for a very, very long time. In fact, I was just in China last quarter, sat with all of these customers talking about our long-term road maps. And we mentioned the awards we got. I mean there's a lot of trust and relationship that's been built up over the years. So we're very confident that we'll continue to enjoy our leadership position there. And other competitors, I mean, they may come and go, but we feel confident we'll maintain our leadership position there."", 'Operator', 'This does conclude our question-and-answer session.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc."", 'Marc N. Casper', ""Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call. As you saw in our press release, our fourth quarter results were ahead of the guidance we provided on our call in October and demonstrates strong execution. As I reflect on our performance for the full year, I'm very proud of our team as they operated with speed at scale to enable the success of our customers, while demonstrating incredibly strong operational discipline and commercial execution. In 2023, we delivered differentiated short-term performance while, at the same time, strengthening our long-term competitive position. I'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter. Our revenue was $10.89 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.55 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points to 23.4%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, growing adjusted EPS 5% to $5.67 per share. Then in terms of our full year results, our revenue was $42.9 billion in 2023, adjusted operating income was $9.81 billion and adjusted EPS was $21.55 per share. Last year, we once again delivered meaningful share gain with our industry-leading products, services and expertise. We leveraged our PPI Business System to enable outstanding execution, including aggressively addressing our cost base to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we strengthened our long-term competitive position with high-impact innovation, exciting and complementary acquisitions, additional investments in our capabilities and further strengthening our trusted partner status with our customers. Turning to our performance by end market. In the fourth quarter, underlying market conditions largely played out in line with our expectations. Our continued strong execution resulted in revenue performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations. Now let me provide you some color on our performance in the context of each of end markets, starting with pharma and biotech. As expected, growth declined in the high single digits for the quarter and approximately 1% for the full year. In 2023, vaccine and therapy runoff resulted in a 7-point headwind in this customer segment, which was effectively offset through share gains as a result of our trusted partner status. We've made strong progress in transitioning COVID-related capacity to other therapies, and that's very exciting for the future. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter and in high single digits for the full year. In 2023, we delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. During the year, we delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. And finally, in diagnostics and health care, in Q4, revenue declined in the high teens and was 30% lower for the full year. In 2023, we delivered good core business growth in this end market, highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of 3 pillars: high-impact innovation; our trusted partner status with customers; and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar. It was another terrific year of high-impact innovation. Throughout the year, we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to advance their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, the yield was highlighted by the launch of the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer, which is helping our customers uncover proteins that were previously undetectable. The scientific breakthrough is enabling customers to advance precision medicine, including the identification of new clinical biomarkers. In the 6 months since launch, the scientific community's adoption of the product has exceeded our high expectations, and the momentum is continuing to build as we enter 2024. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6 STEM, a fully automated system that enables our customers to rapidly obtain large-volume, high-quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to advance development. In Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the first FDA-cleared assays for the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia. This first-of-a-kind diagnostic has received significant attention and adoption as it has significantly raised the standard of care for pregnant women, helping physicians to better manage care by predicting who is most at risk for this condition. In Life Sciences Solution, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next-generation Dynabeads platform, to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. We continued this great innovation momentum in the fourth quarter. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Meridian EX System for precise defect localization in advanced logic semiconductors. And in Laboratory Products, we launched the Thermo Scientific Aquanex Ultrapure Water Purification System for reliable water purity and operational enhancement in laboratories. So another spectacular year of innovation and an exciting pipeline for the future. In 2023, we also continued to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we have earned with our customers. This included the opening of a state-of-the-art customer center of excellence in Milan to showcase our industry-leading product services and expertise. And during the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our position in advanced materials by opening our Customer Experience Center for battery manufacturing in Seoul to accelerate the development of next generation of environmentally friendly energy solutions. We also made significant advancements in the partnerships and collaborations with our customers throughout the year. Building on our longstanding relationship with Boehringer Ingelheim, a great example in the fourth quarter was an exciting opportunity to develop a genomic testing-based companion diagnostic for non-small cell lung cancer patients in Japan and the United States, where lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death. Now let me turn to our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture, which continue to enable successful execution during the year. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. It's helping us to drive share gain, improve quality, productivity and customer allegiance. I'm proud of the way our team leveraged PPI to step up in an agile way to navigate the dynamic environment last year, driving higher commercial intensity, actively managing our cost base and optimizing sourcing. We're also leveraging generative AI as part of our PPI Business System toolkit to increase productivity, further optimize our commercial effectiveness and improve the customer experience. A quick wrap -- recap on capital deployment last year. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we completed our acquisition of The Binding Site, our protein diagnostics business, which enhances our Specialty Diagnostics offering by advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and other immune disorders. The integration has gone smoothly, and the business is performing extremely well and tracking ahead of the deal model. As we look to the future of the protein diagnostics business, our launch of EXENT instrument solution represents a significant breakthrough given its enhanced sensitivity, specificity and ease of use when compared to conventional methods. This is a great complement to our Freelite assays and their strong interest from the medical community due to the positive impact on diagnosing multiple myeloma patients. In the third quarter, we added CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence for approved medicines and therapies. CorEvitas is now integrated into our clinical research business, and customers are seeing the benefit of these additional capabilities. The business is off to a great start and performing very well. During the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Olink, a provider of advanced proteomic solutions that help researchers to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. As a reminder, Olink's technology complements our leading mass spectrometry and life science platforms, and we're uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers. The transaction is on track to be completed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing additions, including regulatory approvals. In 2023, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Let me now give you a brief update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet, and I'm proud of the actions we took in 2023 in this regard. Building on our -- the environmental sustainability initiatives, we continue to accelerate our transition to renewable energy with on-site solar projects and power purchase agreements around the world. This progress will help us achieve our recently established target of utilizing 80% renewable electricity globally by 2030. To advance global health equity in the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with Project HOPE to improve the well-being and treatment outcomes for young people living with HIV in Nigeria, the country with the second largest HIV epidemic worldwide. Throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was once again recognized for our industry leadership and inclusive culture, where colleagues can have a mission-driven career. To list just a few of the recognitions, we were once again included on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies as well as Fortune's inaugural list of Most Innovative Companies. Newsweek named us as one of America's Most Responsible Companies. Forbes included us on its list of the World's Top Companies for Women and named us as one of the Best Employers for Veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. Thanks to our incredible colleagues, we successfully navigated the environment, continues to build a bright future for our company. I'm very excited about 2024 and beyond. So let me now turn to guidance. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our 2024 revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion and an adjusted EPS range -- guidance range of $20.95 to $22 per share. This outlook reflects a continuation of us demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline and enabling the success of our customers. I've had the opportunity to connect with many of our customers in January to understand what's on their minds. Based on our longstanding relationships, we have terrific access to the senior executive teams of our customers. From these conversations, it's clear to me that our customers value our partnership and see us as essential to enabling their success. They are enthusiastic for the future because of the progress in pipelines to treat disease, and there's also great enthusiasm with material science customers for the important advances made in those fields. All of this will create strong long-term demand for our capabilities as we enable customer scientific breakthroughs, and we continue to be incredibly well positioned to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. So to summarize our key takeaways for 2023. Our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. We continue to elevate our trusted partner status and deepen the relationship with many customers last year. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, deliver differentiated performance for the quarter and the full year, helping us to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. We're well positioned in 2024 to once again deliver differentiated short-term performance and further strengthen our long-term competitive position. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"", 'Stephen Williamson', ""Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we executed really well in Q4. Market conditions played out largely as we'd expected in the quarter. And through great execution, we delivered 1% more core organic revenue growth than our prior guide. In terms of adjusted EPS, we beat our prior guide by $0.05, and that included offsetting $0.08 of additional FX headwind through really strong operational execution in the quarter. We also capped off the year with very strong free cash flow, delivering $7 billion in 2023. Throughout the year, we navigated the changing macro environment very effectively. Our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System enabled us to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers and differentiated financial results for our shareholders, all while continuing to invest in the business and advance our strategic position as the world leader in serving science. Let me now provide you some additional details on our performance, beginning with our earnings results. We delivered $5.67 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $21.55 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.20 and $15.45 for the full year. On the top line, reported revenue was 5% lower year-over-year in Q4. The components of our Q4 reported revenue change included 7% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange. Q4 core organic revenue decreased 4%. For the full year 2023, reported and organic revenue decreased 5%, and core organic revenue growth for the year was 1%. In 2023, we delivered $1.73 billion of pandemic-related revenue, $330 million of testing and $1.4 billion of vaccines and therapies revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the quarter -- in the current year and prior year. In Q4, North America declined low double digits. Europe declined low single digits. Asia Pacific grew low single digits, with China declining in the mid-single digits. For the full year, North America declined high single digits. Europe declined low single digits. And Asia Pacific declined low single digits, with China declining high single digit. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.55 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter. And adjusted operating margin was 23.4%, 100 basis points higher than Q4 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization. This was partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, strategic investments and FX. The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI Business System. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 11%, and adjusted operating margin was 22.9%, in line with our prior guide. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.5%, 10 basis points higher than Q4 last year. The change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 41.2%. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.1% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.2% of revenue, an improvement of 60 basis points compared to 2022. Total R&D expense was $328 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.35 billion, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.8% in 2023. Looking at our results below the line. Our Q4 net interest expense was $81 million, which is $38 million lower than Q4 2022. Net interest expense for the full year was $495 million, an increase of $41 million year-over-year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $19 million, $9 million higher than Q4 2022. This is primarily due to changes in nonoperating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net expense of $16 million compared to a net income of $14 million in 2022. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter and for the full year was 10%. This was 280 basis points lower than Q4 last year and 300 basis points lower for the full year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q4, approximately 5 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of options. And shortly after the year-end in January 2024, we repurchased $3 billion of shares. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Full year cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion. And as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow was $7 billion after investing $1.4 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in Q4 and $523 million for the full year. During the year, we invested $3.7 billion on completed acquisitions and committed $3.1 billion to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close by mid-2024. We ended the quarter with $8.1 billion in cash and $34.9 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong return on investment that we're generating across the company. I'll now provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was higher in the prior year, so that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. In 2023, we continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 19%, and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of our pandemic-related revenue in the segment as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported and organic revenue was 26% lower than 2022. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Science Solutions decreased 14%, and adjusted operating margin was 36.2%, up 210 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team has done an excellent job of appropriately managing the cost base and dealing with the unwind of the pandemic. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 39%, and adjusted operating margin was 34.3%. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4, and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by the electron microscopy business. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 10% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 23%, and adjusted operating margin was 28.8%, up 340 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through, which is partially offset by FX and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27%, and adjusted operating margin was 26.3%, an increase of 350 basis points versus the prior year.Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q4, reported revenue declined 1%, and organic revenue was 7% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continue to see strong underlying growth in the core led by transplant diagnostics, microbiology and immunodiagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue declined 8%, and organic revenue was down 13%. Q4 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 27% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, which is 530 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. In Q4, we delivered strong productivity and favorable business mix, which was partially offset by the lower -- the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 10% higher than 2022, and adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, an increase of 400 basis points versus 2022. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue decreased 4% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue and the phasing of revenue in our Pharma Services business within 2023, as had been expected. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 2% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income declined 4%, and adjusted operating margin was 14%, which is 10 basis points lower than Q4 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 17% higher than the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 180 basis points versus 2022. Let me now turn to guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22. Our guidance assumes core organic revenue growth in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. Our view on the expected market conditions in 2024 has not changed significantly from our initial framing for the year shared on the last earnings call. We're assuming that the market declines in the low single digits this year. Our growth strategy and PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again this year. Our current estimate of pandemic-related revenue in 2024 is just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. M&A is expected to increase revenue by $175 million year-over-year, the combination of 6 months of Olink revenue and the inorganic portion of CorEvitas revenue in 2024. At current rates, we expect FX to be neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. From a phasing standpoint, FX is expected to be a slight headwind in Q1 and an offsetting tailwind in the second half. Turning to margins. Our 2024 guidance range assumes adjusted operating income margins between 22.3% and 22.8%. We continue to aggressively manage our cost base, and that's reflected in this margin outlook. In terms of the range for the margins, that's driven by the revenue range that I provided. We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to not only manage costs very carefully, but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls, including the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year, are expected to largely offset the runoff in the remaining pandemic-related revenue inflation and a normalization of incentive compensation across the company to appropriately invest in our colleagues. Below the line, we expect approximately $430 million of net interest expense in 2024 and expect adjusted other income and expense to net close to 0. We assume that adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024. And below the tax line, you should factor in $20 million of profit elimination related to minority interests. We're expecting between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures in 2024, and we're assuming free cash flow is in the range of $6.5 billion and $7 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion of share buybacks, which, as I mentioned earlier, were already completed in January. And we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 383 million shares. We're assuming that we'll return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we're assuming that we close the acquisition of Olink by midyear. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are a few things to consider. First, in terms of organic revenue growth, we expect Q1 to be better sequentially than Q4 '23 by 1 to 2 points and then improve each quarter during the year. Implied in that is core organic revenue growth in Q1 similar to Q4 '23. And core organic revenue growth is also expected to improve each quarter during the year, leading to moderate growth in the second half of the year. From a margin standpoint, we expect Q1 to be just under 21% and increase each quarter throughout the year from that level. And we expect Q1 adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 22% of the full year. So in conclusion, we navigated the challenging environment in 2023 very successfully. We stepped up for our customers and delivered differentiated financial performance for our shareholders. We continue to manage the company with agility, and we're really well positioned for the year ahead. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."", 'Rafael Tejada', ""Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.', 'Jack Meehan', 'Marc, if you look at the business -- so if you look at the business, I think the question is that you start to see some recovery. Could you talk about what parts you think could grow more or less above market and just what that can mean in terms of revenue and earnings?', 'Marc N. Casper', ""Yes. So Jack, when I think about last year, and you've heard us say delivering differentiated short-term performance, strengthen the company for the long term kind of simultaneously, we had the opportunity to look at, obviously, for the first 9 months of how others have done, and we looked at those companies that preannounced or reported so far. And we had a really strong year in terms of delivering above-market growth, which means share gain, right? And that share gain actually was broad-based in terms of the performance. You look at things like Analytical Instruments, very strong; clinical research, pharma services. These businesses did well. And by the absence of some, I'm not implying anything in the others. This is a very strong year relative to a challenged set of market conditions. As I think to the future, we're well positioned in those businesses to continue our share gain momentum. We made an assumption for this year, which is pretty much the same as what we said back in late October, is that we're assuming that for the full year, it's going to be pretty similar to 2023 and a mirror image, meaning that we start to lap comps as the year unfolds and we wind up with the market being down slightly in the low single digits and us performing better than that level. So I'm excited about what the year unfolds and our position to deliver differentiated performance. And we're certainly going to capitalize on any improvements in the market and hold ourselves to a very high standard of what good looks like."", 'Jack Meehan', 'Okay. And are there specific businesses you can talk about? So as an example in the script, I think you talked about transitioning capacity, new therapies. So in a potential recovery, what -- can you talk about how you expect phasing for Patheon and some of -- and the bioprocessing business?', 'Marc N. Casper', ""Yes. So when I think about the year, we basically use a range of outcomes for each of our businesses in terms of how they perform. I believe that the second half of the year based on lapping the comps as well as we're expecting that the market conditions improve slightly as the year unfolds, and that helps with demand for the industry and for us is how I would think about the business in aggregate is the way that we manage the company. So thank you, Jack."", 'Operator', 'The next question today comes from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel.', 'Daniel Anthony Arias', ""Marc, obviously, a lot of discussion on destocking across the industry. Can you just maybe add some color to where you think you are with that process? And maybe draw a distinction for us between the inventory work down that's taking place on the bioprocess side specifically versus more routine consumables. If you split it that way, are the drawdowns kind of happening at a similar pace and ending in a similar time? Or do you think we should sort of keep those 2 buckets separately or think of them differently?"", 'Marc N. Casper', ""Yes. So Dan, I guess, let me start with sort of bioproduction, which I think is the essence of the question, and then maybe I'll step one level above that. In terms of bioproduction, it is an incredibly good long-term market. Historically, it's been an incredibly good market. Sort of a taboo name these days, right, in terms of bioproduction, it caused a lot of volatility during certainly 2023 in the industry. For us, a couple of facts, right? It's a little bit under 10% of our revenue, and we have best-in-class bioprocessing products with an incredible global footprint. We have leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technologies and increasingly important purification business as we grow our share position there.When I think about the fourth quarter, we did see a sequential pickup in orders in Q4 versus Q3. But the underlying activity is still muted, right, in the market. So we didn't see an inflection. We weren't expecting one, and we didn't see one in the fourth quarter.Our view is that it will normalize as the year unfolds. And as I've said in an investor conference earlier in the year, no one is going to get rewarded for calling the moment of when that inflection happens. So it will play out during the course of the year, and the long-term fundamentals here are very strong.When I think about our businesses in general coming into the year, I think the things that are very exciting is the trusted partner status that we have earned with our customers over many, many years. We're in the room with the decision-makers. We understand what's on their mind. We're incredibly well positioned.And if I think about the midterm outlook for clinical research, for Pharma Services, for bioproduction, for our channel business, it's incredibly well positioned, right, in terms of we're part of helping our customers bring the breakthroughs to their pipeline, we're part of helping them navigate whatever the environment is. So hopefully, that's helpful.And then maybe the last comment that I would make is one of my takeaways from the many, many customer interactions that I had in the first month of the year was that in the biotech community, and what I mean by biotech, as I'll call it, the smaller companies, the capital market dependent companies in the [biopharmaceutical] segment, they were much more positive, right? They're seeing green shoots. They love the M&A activity that was happening at the end of the year that gets investors excited about new company formation, new rounds of capital. And while it's early and it will take some time, it's certainly the most optimistic that I've seen in the last 5 quarters in terms of what the tone was on the -- on their view. And I think that bodes very well for the coming few years. Thank you."", 'Daniel Anthony Arias', ""Okay. That's encouraging. Maybe just a follow-up on the AI piece, consistently solid growth there. I'm curious if you're just still carrying a backlog in microscopy. And can you maybe just talk a little bit about lead times and order conversion this year? Is the assumption that those might get extended as we move through the year? Or do you think maybe you can be stable relative to where we are today?"", 'Marc N. Casper', ""Yes. So when I think about the performance of our Analytical Instruments business with double-digit growth for the full year, it's awesome. Really, a tremendous year. It was across all 3 businesses. The backlog that we carried into the beginning of 2023, those things largely cleared in the first half of '23. So we're at -- we've been at normal lead times, normal shipping times really for about 6 months now in terms of that already. So we're kind of in a normal spot. And while there won't be the repeat of the unwind of the pandemic impacts on the supply chain, the business is positioned for a good year. And there's a high demand for the breakthrough technologies, whether it's in electron microscopy, for semiconductor, material science, life sciences or the astral, right, in chroma and mass spec. It's just incredible demand for those technologies. So we're excited for the upcoming year and the future of that business."", 'Operator', 'The next question today comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.', 'Derik De Bruin', ""So Marc, I'm just sort of curious. Last quarter, you were talking about 1% core growth when you were sort of looking at your initial framework for 2024. If I heard you correctly, now it's plus or minus 1%. It didn't seem like Q4 got a lot worse in anything. So -- and what -- sort of what's changed? Are you more conservative on the PPD and these businesses? Are you more conservative on just tough comps? I'm just sort of curious, what's embedded now in this more conservative outlook?"", 'Marc N. Casper', ""Stephen, why don't you..."", 'Stephen Williamson', ""Yes. It's -- let me provide some context on the guidance, kind of step back on that and then -- and hopefully help frame your question. So we provided an early framing for '24 on our last call, and we had the insight on how Q4 played out and have completed our detailed planning work with our businesses. Through that process, our view on the market outlook has not changed significantly. The guidance is not significantly different from the initial framing that we provided. It includes the latest view on FX, both rates and expected mix of revenue and cost by currency. That increased revenue from our initial framing, but no impact on operating income, which reduces our margins by 20 basis points from that initial framing. And then from an operational standpoint, I think the only item of note that's changed in the past 3 months is a discrete item in our Pharma Services business. We're transitioning some of our sterile fill finish capacity from COVID vaccine support to GLP-1 support. We would have been expecting to recognize an upfront fee in Q1 '24. Now that the accounting is finalized, we expect to recognize that benefit in line with production, which actually starts in '25. So it shifted approximately $0.20 out of Q1 '24, and that's had some impact on -- in terms of the reported core growth.And then one other comment on the guidance is that we thought it best to provide a range, not a point estimate. So I think it's more helpful for our investors. And the range of outcomes for the year, now, the range doesn't encapsulate every possible scenario for the year, but it does capture the reasonably likely scenarios of how the year can play out as we see it today. And the range is about $1.2 billion of revenue and $1.05 of adjusted EPS, which I think is appropriate given the scale of the company. But hopefully, it kind of tees up kind of the framing for the guide."", 'Derik De Bruin', ""Okay. And a little bit more, how should we sort of think about the segment margins as we go through? I mean, I'm just sort of looking -- I mean, you've seen really good progress in LSS, and it may seem a good progress in your margins, expansion of margins across all of them. But I'm just sort of thinking about how should we think about LPS and given where you were in the -- is that 14% margin range that we're saying for the full year, is that sort of sustainable? Does that fall back next year? I'm just trying to figure out where the margin hit is on -- given relative to what our expectations were."", 'Stephen Williamson', ""In terms of the margin profile for the -- we finished the year at exactly where we guided to for the full year for our margin profile for the company. And I think some of the changes in terms of Q4 versus -- between the segments, I don't think everyone quite understood the phasing of our revenue within lab products and biopharma services. So when I see some of the pre-call notes, this is, I think, a little bit different in terms of what -- there's some expectations. But from our expectations internally, Q4 played out as we'd expected.And then from margins going forward, I think the margin profile that we have today, I'm not calling a significant difference in margin profile going forward into next year. And I think where we are on landing point on margins for the segments is probably a good starting point for the -- to think about for the year ahead."", 'Operator', 'The next question today comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research.', 'Douglas Anthony Schenkel', ""So I want to start just with a high-level LRP question, and then my follow-up is really just a clarification on LPS. So on the LRP, Marc, you've been consistent in saying that Thermo is built to grow 2 to 3 points better than the peer group over the long term. That said, you did talk about 7% to 9% growth as recently as last year's Analyst Day. I'm sure the 2 to 3 points hasn't changed. But as we flip the calendar, is it fair to say that the 7% to 9% growth rate maybe is a little bit high, even in a more normalized environment? I just want to give you an opportunity to maybe just adjust that as we kind of flip the calendar and look ahead.And below the top line, you've done a fantastic job, as always, leaning operations in a more challenging period. Never let a good crisis go to waste. Your guidance suggests to me, at least on the surface, that you may be investing more in the near term. But as we think about a return to normal, I'm just wondering if you think we could get some outsized incremental margin flow-through for the business as the business normalizes. So let me leave it there, and then I'll ask a quick follow-up on LPS in a second."", 'Marc N. Casper', ""Sure. So Doug, thanks for the question. In terms of the long-range outlook, right, we raised our outlook in -- late in 2021. And what that -- at that moment, we can't remember exactly what that moment was, but we were growing 25%, right? We were growing at an extraordinary organic rate. And what we wanted to do was give our investors a very long-term view of what is the market and what is our position in the market, right?And in terms of our ability to gain share, 3 points, I think is -- 2, 3 -- I use 3 for simplicity. 3 points faster than the market is kind of the standard we hold ourselves to, and we've been delivering that for a while. And we've been growing share for a really long while for many, many, many years. And so nothing has changed there.In terms of the market growth, right, where the market was extraordinary when we said it, we said 4% to 6% was going to be our underlying market growth, and that was higher than 3% to 5%. And the change was actually just that we had a larger exposure to pharma and biotech as we built our business capability there.When I look to the future and I think about what's going on in the drivers of the long term in our industry, I feel incredibly confident that this is a 4% to 6% growth industry and that we're well positioned to grow, for simplicity, 3 points faster than that, so 7% to 9%.So while I get the question a lot, and obviously in a period where we delivered 1% core growth in 2023, that's a long way from 7% to 9%. But our view on the market declining low single digits last year reflects at least a share gain component. And when I look to the future, I continue to remain very confident in the long-term health of the industry.I've had some really interesting discussions with investors and basically went through the logic saying, if you're bullish on life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, you're probably at 6% long-term growth. And if you're bearish on the life science tools, diagnostics and pharma services, you're probably at 4% industry growth. But you have to be incredibly bearish on the world to actually get to less than 4% industry growth for the long term in our segment because this -- we really are a GDP-plus-type business in terms of the markets that we serve.So hopefully, that gives you at least a sense of how we think about it. And while I appreciate the offer to change our outlook, I couldn't be more confident in the future of our industry and our competitive position.In terms of the below the line, the very high-level concept, I do believe that as you see volumes grow at a normalized rate, you'll see a very strong flow-through on the margins. And part of what's going on with the margins for this year is we reset our incentive compensation for our colleagues back to normalized levels after a year of below that. So just the math that you have some level of headwind embedded in the easier numbers, nothing different than we expected in October. But that's part of why you don't see as much of the margin step-up that one would expect to have."", 'Douglas Anthony Schenkel', ""Okay. I'm going to -- I'll leave the LPS question for another day. But I guess, the other part of my question on the margins, Marc, was, obviously, you got to pay people, you got to reset things. In a period where you're not growing as much, this is where Thermo has historically played offense, while others have played defense to a certain extent. So I'm just wondering if you're actually pulling forward some investment early in the year, and that could over the next several quarters lead to even better-than-expected margin flow-through as the company returns to a more normalized period."", 'Stephen Williamson', ""Yes. Doug, I think the example that I gave on the GLP-1 contract is we're basically standing up a facility for a customer. We're getting paid a fee to do that. We get to recognize that fee over the production volumes, and we're incurring substantial costs in the interim in '24, which will create good accretive growth going forward. That's one good example.And we're continuing to invest in innovation across the company. And we've not lessened our drive here to really drive great long-term growth. So we're appropriately managing our cost, our top line environment, but we're making sure that we're actually putting the right investments in place and to make sure that, that top line environment stays -- and the outlook stays as good as we -- as much as articulated."", 'Operator', 'The next question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.', 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""My first one, Marc, when I look at the annual guidance here, the core is flattish at the midpoint. But excluding the vaccine headwinds, it's about 3 points. That's a pretty solid guide. The 3 things that have come up is China, the CRO business and analytical tech. Can you just remind us what China, what PPD did in fiscal '23? And is the guide assuming those 3 pieces, China, CRO and analytical tech, is that at 3%, about 3%, below 3%?"", 'Marc N. Casper', ""So Vijay, thanks for the question. So when I think about the performance of our businesses, certainly last year and certainly as we look to the future, last year, just spectacular performance in our clinical research business. Really, the team, unbelievably good job in terms of the results.And I think that in a way, we probably undersold the details, not the numbers as much as what actually was going on because there's so many different things we were communicating. But if I think about clinical research, it's a little over 2 years after the acquisition, phenomenal acquisition. Customers love the business performing well, colleagues doing a great job, right? And it's been a big success.The business in the pandemic played the largest role in supporting the clinical trials on vaccines and, at the same time, delivered by far the fastest, I'll call it, underlying growth, excluding all of the COVID activity, just crushed it. And that means for this year, we have both a roll-off, which we've given transparency to on a big chunk of the vaccine revenue, which is fine. And we have generated a really substantial comparison, which is cool. Like we -- that's a good challenge to have in terms of the great performance.So we would expect that the business' growth would be much more moderate this year just based on the comparisons. But the future, meaning looking out into '25 and beyond, this is a really strong business, long-term, high single-digit growth business, plus the synergies it's driving. So I feel really great about that.And then a quick comment just on China and which is unrelated to clinical research, but sort of the other element of your question. China, market conditions were challenged in 2023. First quarter was really strong, lots of stimulus, all of those good things. But then -- so that was China effectively.We're not calling for a meaningful improvement in China this year. Rather, we lap the comparisons as the year unfolds. So it becomes a little bit less of a headwind. We all know that at some point, the Chinese government will create some mechanism of stimulus. Whether that's direct or confidence or whatever it does, we don't know when that will happen. But at some point, it will improve the market conditions because the needs for what we do is very high. So I'm bullish on the long term being better in China than what we've been experiencing currently, and it will take some time to get there. Thanks, Vijay. Go ahead."", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', 'Stephen, just one quick one for you. On Q1, I think operating margin is less likely under 21%. I think the EPS is around $4.70-ish. Is that just the outsized impact from incentive comp reset? Just want to understand the Q1 margin cadence.', 'Stephen Williamson', ""Yes. So when I think about the margin in Q1, that's definitely an element when you look at it year-over-year and kind of sequentially as well. So when I think about it year-over-year, so there's -- obviously, we have a significant drag from the lower pandemic revenue and the reset of the incentive comp. That's just under 200 basis points in total and then about 100 basis points contribution from the core business, despite the lower dollars of revenue. And the key driver there being the impact of the cost actions that we've taken over the past year. So to give you a way to frame the margin in Q1. And then, yes, the margin profile grows each quarter as the revenue dollars grow during the year in terms of the profile for the year ahead."", 'Operator', 'Our final question today comes from the line of Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley.', 'Tejas Rajeev Savant', ""Marc, just a followup on your China commentary there, more in terms of the long-term opportunity. You've talked in the past about that being an important market for you growing at the higher end of your outlook for the company. Recently, there's been a thawing in relations over the last month or so. I think you've kind of alluded to that as well and some high-level government engagement.But then a little while ago, we got word of this BIOSECURE act legislation. Can you just help us think through sort of what that entails for you? Perhaps, an opportunity to be more front footed and gain share in the near term on the services side versus kind of the long-term risk of a potential blowback from the Chinese side on -- in terms of U.S. MNCs operating in that market. That would be super helpful."", 'Marc N. Casper', ""Sure. So thanks for the question. In terms of China, a market that we've been in for 40 years, a set of capabilities that we built over a long period of time that's helped Chinese society, right, and created American jobs as part of it. Better food supply, addressing air pollution, helping produce medicines for the local population, we have a great reputation. I've had the honor of being the Chair of the U.S.-China Business Council over the last couple of years and interacting both with the U.S. administration and the Chinese government.And while it's clear to me that the short-term GDP environment is challenged in China, that the needs for what our industry does and what Thermo Fisher does for the long term is good. It will be a solid growth market, certainly one of the faster growing geographies in the long term.In terms of the relations between the countries, yes, I agree with your sentiment, there's a thawing. And in terms of potential legislation, there are thousands of bills that are written that don't happen. So until something sort of matures through the process, it's hard to really know whether it comes to pass and what the exact implications.And my quick read of what they're working on in this particular one, it really is basically an opportunity for non-Chinese companies to have a stronger position in serving federal government related entities. So that's sort of the essence of that. And obviously, as a non-Chinese company, we'd be well positioned to support the U.S. government.So thank you for the question. Let me just do a quick wrap on the call. So thanks, everyone, for participating in our call today. We entered this year with strong momentum. We're in a great position to deliver an excellent year in 2024. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks, everyone."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

Our adjusted operating income was $2.55 billion."", 'We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points to 23.4% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, growing adjusted EPS 5% to $5.67 per share. Then in terms of our full-year results, our revenue was $42.9 billion in 2023, adjusted operating income was $9.81 billion, and adjusted EPS was $21.55 per share. Last year, we once again delivered meaningful share gain with our industry-leading products, services, and expertise. We leveraged our PPI business system to enable outstanding execution, including aggressively addressing our cost base to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment.', 'At the same time, we strengthened our long-term competitive position with high-impact innovation, exciting and complementary acquisitions, additional investments in our capabilities, and further strengthening our trusted partner status with our customers. Turning to our performance by end market, in the fourth quarter, underlying market conditions largely played out in line with our expectations. Our continued strong execution resulted in revenue performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations. Now let me provide you some color on our performance in the context of each of our end markets.', ""Starting with pharma and biotech, as expected, growth declined in the high single digits for the quarter and approximately 1% for the full year. In 2023, vaccine and therapy runoff resulted in a seven-point headwind in this customer segment, which was effectively offset through share gains as a result of our trusted partner status. We've made strong progress in transitioning COVID-related capacity to other therapies, and that's very exciting for the future. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter and in high-single digits for the full year."", 'In 2023, we delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including electron microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry, as well as the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. During the year, we delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, in Q4, revenue declined in the high teens and was 30% lower for the full year.', ""In 2023, we delivered good core business growth in this end market, highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology, and transplant diagnostic businesses. I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars, high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was another terrific year of high-impact innovation."", ""Throughout the year, we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthened our industry leadership by enabling our customers to advance their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, the year was highlighted by the launch of the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer, which is helping our customers uncover proteins that were previously undetectable. The scientific breakthrough is enabling customers to advance precision medicine, including the identification of new clinical biomarkers. In the six months since launch, the scientific community's adoption of the product has exceeded our high expectations and the momentum is continuing to build as we enter 2024."", 'In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6 S/TEM, a fully automated system that enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high-quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to advanced development. In specialty diagnostics, we launched the first FDA-cleared assays for the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia. This first-of-a-kind diagnostic has received significant attention and adoption as it has significantly raised the standard of care for pregnant women, helping physicians to better manage care by predicting who is most at risk for this condition. In Life Sciences Solutions, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies.', 'We continued this great innovation momentum in the fourth quarter. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Meridian EX System for precise defect localization in advanced logic semiconductors. And in low laboratory products we launched the Thermo Scientific Aquanex Ultrapure Water Purification System for reliable water purity and operational enhancement in laboratories. So another spectacular year of innovation and an exciting pipeline for the future.', 'In 2023, we also continued to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we have earned with our customers. This included the opening of a state-of-the-art customer center of excellence in Milan to showcase our industry-leading product services and expertise. And during the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our position in advanced materials by opening a customer experience center for battery manufacturing in Seoul to accelerate the development of next generation of environmentally friendly energy solutions. We also made significant advancements in the partnerships and collaborations with our customers throughout the year.', ""Building on our long-standing relationship with Borenger Ingelheim, a great example in the fourth quarter was an exciting opportunity to develop a genomic testing-based companion diagnostic for non-small cell lung cancer patients in Japan and the United States, where lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death. Now let me turn to our PPI business system and our mission driven culture, which continued to enable successful execution during the year. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. It's helping us to drive share gain, improve quality, productivity, and customer allegiance."", ""I'm proud of the way our team leveraged PPI to step up in an agile way to navigate the dynamic environment last year, driving higher commercial intensity, actively managing our cost base, and optimizing sourcing. We're also leveraging generative AI as part of our PPI business system toolkit to increase productivity, further optimize our commercial effectiveness, and improve the customer experience. A quick recap on capital deployment last year. We continued to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders."", ""In terms of M&A, we completed our acquisition of the binding site, our protein diagnostics business which enhances our specialty diagnostics offering by advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and other immune disorders. The integration has gone smoothly and the business is performing extremely well and tracking ahead of the deal model. As we look to the future of the protein diagnostics business, our launch of EXENT instrument solution represents a significant breakthrough given its enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use when compared to conventional methods. This is a great complement to our Freelite assays and there's strong interest from the medical community due to the positive impact on diagnosing multiple myeloma patients."", 'In the third quarter, we added CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory grade real-world evidence for approved medicines and therapies. CorEvitas is now integrated into our clinical research business, and customers are seeing the benefits of these additional capabilities. The business is off to a great start and performing very well. During the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Olink, a provider of advanced proteomic solutions that help researchers to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently.', 'As a reminder, Olink Technology compliments our leading mass spectrometry and life science platforms, and we are uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers. The transaction is on track to be completed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing additions, including regulatory approvals. In 2023, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Let me now give you a brief update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives.', ""As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet. And I'm proud of the actions we took in 2023 in this regard. Building on the environmental sustainability initiatives, we continue to accelerate our transition to renewable energy with on-site solar projects and power purchase agreements around the world."", ""This progress will help us achieve our recently established target of utilizing 80% renewable electricity globally by 2030. To advance Global Health Equity in the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with Project HOPE to improve the well-being and treatment outcomes for young people living with HIV in Nigeria, the country with the second-largest HIV epidemic worldwide. Throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was once again recognized for our industry leadership and inclusive culture, where colleagues can have a mission-driven career. To list just a few of the recognitions, we were once again included on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies, as well as Fortune's inaugural list of most innovative companies."", ""Newsweek named us as one of America's most responsible companies, Forbes included us on its list of the world's top companies for women and named us as one of the best employers for veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. Thanks to our incredible colleagues, we successfully navigated the environment, continued to build a bright future for our company. I'm very excited about 2024 and beyond."", ""So let me now turn to guidance. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our 2024 revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion, and an adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22 per share. This outlook reflects a continuation of us demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline and enabling the success of our customers."", ""I've had the opportunity to connect with many of our customers in January to understand what's on their minds. Based on our long-standing relationships, we have terrific access to the senior executive teams of our customers. From these conversations, it's clear to me that our customers value our partnership and see us as essential to enabling their success. They're enthusiastic for the future because of the progress and pipelines to treat disease, and there's also great enthusiasm with material science customers for the important advances made in those fields."", 'All of this will create strong long-term demand for our capabilities as we enable customer scientific breakthroughs, and we continue to be incredibly well-positioned to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. So to summarize our key takeaways for 2023, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. We continue to elevate our trusted partner status and deepen the relationship with many customers last year. And this in combination with the power of our PPI business system delivered differentiated performance for the quarter and the full year, helping us to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment.', ""We're well-positioned in 2024 to once again deliver differentiated short-term performance and further strengthen our long-term competitive position. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen."", 'Stephen Williamson -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release we executed really well in Q4. Market conditions played out largely as we had expected in the quarter, and through the great execution, we delivered 1% more core organic revenue growth than our prior guide. In terms of adjusted EPS, we beat our prior guide by $0.05 and that included offsetting $0.08 of additional FX headwind, so really strong operational execution in the quarter.', 'We also capped off the year with very strong free cash flow delivering $7 billion in 2023. Throughout the year we navigated the changing macro environment very effectively. Our proven growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers and differentiated financial results for our shareholders, all the while continuing to invest in the business and advance our strategic position as the world leader in serving science. Let me now provide you some additional details in our performance.', 'Beginning with our earnings results, we delivered $5.67 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $21.55 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.20 and $15.45 for the full year. On the top line, reported revenue was 5% lower year over year in Q4. The components of our Q4 reported revenue change included 7% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions, and a tail end of 1% from foreign exchange.', 'Q4 core organic revenue decreased 4%. For the full-year 2023 reported and organic revenue decreased 5% and core organic revenue growth for the year was 1%. In 2023, we delivered $1.73 billion of pandemic-related revenue, $330 million of testing, and $1.4 billion of vaccines and therapies revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the quarter -- in the current year and prior year.', 'In Q4, North America declined low double digits, Europe declined low single digits, Asia Pacific grew low single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits. For the full year, North America declined high single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia-Pacific declined low single digits with China declining high single digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.55 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 23.4%, 100 basis points higher than Q4 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization, this is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, strategic investments, and FX.', ""The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI business system. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in line with our prior guide. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.5%, 10 basis points higher than Q4 last year."", 'The change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 41.2%. Moving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.1% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.2% of revenue, an improvement of 60 basis points compared to 2022.', 'Total R&D expense was $328 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.35 billion, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.8% in 2023. Looking at our results below the line, our Q4 net interest expense was $81 million, which is $38 million lower than Q4 2022.', 'Net interest expense for the full year was $495 million, an increase of $41 million year over year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $19 million, $9 million higher than Q4 2022. This is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net expense of $16 million, compared to a net income of $14 million in 2022.', 'Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter and for the full year was 10%. This was 280 basis points lower than Q4 last year and 300 basis points lower for the full year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q4, approximately 5 million lower year over year driven by share repurchases net of options. And shortly after the year-end in January 2024, we repurchased $3 billion of shares.', 'Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, full-year cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion and as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow was $7 billion after investing $1.4 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in Q4 and $523 million for the full year. During the year, we invested $3.7 billion on completed acquisitions and committed $3.1 billion to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close by mid-2024. We ended the quarter with $8.1 billion in cash and $34.9 billion of total debt.', ""Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong return on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments."", 'The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was higher in the prior year so that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. In 2023, we continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 19%, and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior-year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of our pandemic-related revenue in this segment as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year-ago quarter.', 'For the full year, reported and organic revenue was 26% lower than 2022. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Science Solutions decreased 14% and adjusted operating margin was 36.2%, up 210 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team has done an excellent job of appropriately managing the cost base and dealing with the unwind of the pandemic.', 'For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 39% and adjusted operating margin was 34.3%. In the Analytical Instruments segments, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by the electron microscopy business. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 10% higher than 2022.', 'In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 28.8%, up 340 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through, which is partially offset by FX and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 26.3%, an increase of 350 basis points versus the prior year. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q4, reported revenue declined 1% and organic revenue was 7% lower than the prior year quarter.', 'In Q4, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by transplant diagnostics, microbiology, and immunodiagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue was down 13%. Q4 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 27% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, which is 530 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022.', 'In Q4, we delivered strong productivity and favorable business mix, which was partially offset by the lower -- the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 10% higher than 2022 and adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, an increase of 400 basis points versus 2022. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue decreased 4% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior-year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue and the phasing of revenue in our pharma services business within 2023 as had been expected.', 'For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 2% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 14%, which is 10 basis points lower than Q4 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 17% higher than the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 180 basis points versus 2022.', ""Let me now turn to guidance and as Marc outlined, we're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22. Our guidance assumes core organic revenue growth in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. Our view on the expected market conditions in 2024 has not changed significantly from our initial framing for the year shared on the last earnings call. We're assuming that the market declines in the low single digits this year, our growth strategy and PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again this year."", 'Our current estimate of pandemic-related revenue in 2024 is just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. M&A is expected to increase revenue by $175 million year over year, the combination of six months of Olink revenue and the inorganic portion of CorEvitas revenue in 2024. At current rates, we expect FX to be neutral year over year to both revenue and adjusted EPS.', ""From a phasing standpoint, FX is expected to be a slight headwind in Q1 and an offsetting tailwind in the second half. Turning to margins, our 2024 guidance range assumes adjusted operating income margins between 22.3% and 22.8%. We continue to aggressively manage our cost base, and that's reflected in this margin outlook. In terms of the range for the margins, that's driven by the revenue range that I provided."", ""We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to not only manage costs very carefully but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls, including the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year, are expected to largely offset the runoff in the remaining pandemic-related revenue inflation and a normalization of incentive compensation across the company to appropriately invest in our colleagues. Below the line, we expect approximately $430 million of net interest expense in 2024 and expect adjusted other income and expense to net close to zero. We assume that adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024 and below the tax line, you should factor in $20 million of profit elimination related to minority interests."", ""We're expecting between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures in 2024, and we're assuming free cash flow is in the range of $6.5 billion and $7 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion of share buybacks, which, as I mentioned earlier, were already completed in January and we estimate the full-year average diluted share count will be approximately 383 million shares. We're assuming that we'll return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we're assuming that we closed the acquisition of Olink by midyear. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are a few things to consider."", 'First, in terms of organic revenue growth we expect Q1 to be better sequentially than Q4 2023 by 1 to 2 points and then improve each quarter during the year. Implied in that is core organic revenue growth in Q1 similar to Q4 2023. And core organic revenue growth is also expected to improve each quarter during the year, leading to moderate growth in the second half of the year. From a margin standpoint, we expect Q1 to be just under 21% and increase each quarter throughout the year from that level.', ""And we expect Q1 adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 22% of the full year. So in conclusion, we navigated the challenging environment in 2023 very successfully. We stepped up for our customers and delivered differentiated financial performance for our shareholders. We continue to manage the company with agility, and we're really well-positioned for the year ahead."", ""I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."", 'Rafael Tejada -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.', 'Jack Meehan -- Nephron Research -- Analyst', 'Thank you. Good morning. Marc, if you look at the business -- so if you look at the business, I think the question is that you start to see some recovery. Could you talk about what parts you think could grow more or less above market and just what that can mean in terms of revenue and earnings?', 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. So Jack, when I think about last year and you've heard us say delivering differentiated short-term performance, strengthen the company for the long term kind of simultaneously, we had the opportunity to look at, obviously, for the first nine months of how others have done, and we looked at those companies that preannounced or reported so far. And we had a really strong year in terms of delivering above-market growth, which means share gain, right. And that share gain actually was broad-based in terms of the performance."", ""You look at things like Analytical Instruments, very strong; clinical research, pharma services. These businesses did well. And by the absence of some, I'm not implying anything in the others. This is a very strong year relative to a challenged set of market conditions."", ""As I think to the future, we're well-positioned in those businesses to continue our share gain momentum. We made an assumption for this year, which is pretty much the same as what we said back in late October, is that we're assuming that for the full year, it's going to be pretty similar to 2023 and a mirror image, meaning that we start to lap comps as the year unfolds and we wind up with the market being down slightly in the low single digits and us performing better than that level. So I'm excited about what the year unfolds and our position to deliver differentiated performance. And we're certainly going to capitalize on any improvements in the market and hold ourselves to a very high standard of what good looks like."", 'Jack Meehan -- Nephron Research -- Analyst', 'OK. And are there specific businesses you can talk about, so as an example in the script, I think you talked about transitioning capacity, new therapies. So like in a potential recovery, like what -- can you talk about how you expect phasing for Patheon and some of -- and the bioprocessing business?', 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. So when I think about the year, we basically use a range of outcomes for each of our businesses in terms of how they perform. I believe that the second half of the year based on lapping the comps as well as we're expecting that the market conditions improve slightly as the year unfolds. And that helps with demand for the industry and for us is how I would think about the business in aggregate is the way that we manage the company."", 'So thank you, Jack.', 'Jack Meehan -- Nephron Research -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question today comes from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.', 'Dan Arias -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""Good morning guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc, obviously, a lot of discussion on destocking across the industry. Can you just maybe add some color to where you think you are with that process and maybe draw a distinction for us between the inventory work-down that's taking place on the bioprocess side specifically versus more routine consumables, if you split it that way, are the drawdowns kind of happening at a similar pace and ending in a similar time or do you think we should sort of keep those two buckets separately or think of them differently?"", 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. So Dan, I guess, let me start with sort of bioproduction, which I think is the essence of the question, and then maybe I'll step one level above that. In terms of bioproduction, it is an incredibly good long-term market. Historically, it's been an incredibly good market."", ""Sort of a taboo name these days, right, in terms of bioproduction, caused a lot of volatility during certainly 2023 in the industry. For us, a couple of facts, it's a little bit under 10% of our revenue, and we have best-in-class bioprocessing products with an incredible global footprint. We have leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technologies, and increasingly important purification business as we grow our share position there. When I think about the fourth quarter, we did see a sequential pickup in orders in Q4 versus Q3."", ""But the underlying activity is still muted, right, in the market. So we didn't see an inflection. We weren't expecting one and we didn't see one in the fourth quarter. Our view is that it will normalize as the year unfolds and as I've said in an investor conference earlier in the year, no one is going to get rewarded for calling the moment of when that inflection happens."", ""So it will play out during the course of the year, and the long-term fundamentals here are very strong. When I think about our businesses in general coming into the year, I think the things that are very exciting is the trusted partner status that we have earned with our customers over many, many years. We're in the room with the decision-makers. We understand what's on their mind."", ""We're incredibly well-positioned. And if I think about the midterm outlook for clinical research, for pharma services, for bioproduction, for our channel business, it's incredibly well-positioned, right, in terms of we're part of helping our customers bring the breakthroughs to their pipeline, we're part of helping them navigate whatever the environment is. So hopefully, that's helpful. And then maybe the last comment that I would make is one of my takeaways from the many, many customer interactions that I had in the first month of the year was that in the biotech community, and what I mean by biotech, as I'll call it, the smaller companies, the capital market-dependent companies in the pharmaceutical segment, they were much more positive, right."", ""They're seeing green shoots. They love the M&A activity that was happening at the end of the year that gets investors excited about new company formation, new rounds of capital. And while it's early and it will take some time, it's certainly the most optimistic that I've seen in the last five quarters in terms of what the tone was on their view. And I think that bodes very well for the coming few years."", 'Thank you.', 'Dan Arias -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""OK. That's encouraging. Maybe just a follow-up on the AI piece, consistently solid growth there. I'm curious if you're just still carrying a backlog in microscopy."", 'And can you maybe just talk a little bit about lead times and order conversion this year, is the assumption that those might get extended as we move through the year or do you think maybe you can be stable relative to where we are today? Thanks.', 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. So when I think about the performance of our Analytical Instruments business with double-digit growth for the full year, it's awesome. Really a tremendous year. It was across all three businesses."", ""The backlog that we carried into the beginning of 2023, those things largely cleared in the first half of 2023. So we're at -- we've been normal lead times, normal shipping times really for about six months now in terms of that already. So we're kind of in a normal spot. And yeah, there won't be the repeat of the unwind of the pandemic impacts on the supply chain."", ""The business is positioned for a good year and there's a high demand for the breakthrough technologies, whether it's in electron microscopy, or semiconductor, material science, life sciences or the Astral, right, in chroma and mass spec, just incredible demand for those technologies. So we're excited for the upcoming year and the future of that business."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.', 'Derik De Bruin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning everyone.', 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning Derik.', 'Derik De Bruin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""So, Marc, I'm just sort of curious, last quarter you were talking about 1% core growth when you were sort of looking at your initial framework for 2024. If I heard you correctly, now it's plus or minus 1%. It didn't seem like Q4 got a lot worse in anything. So what -- sort of what's changed, are you more conservative on the PPD in these businesses, are you more conservative on just tough comps, I'm just sort of curious, what's embedded now in this like more conservative outlook?"", 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Stephen, why don't you --"", 'Stephen Williamson -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yes. Let me provide some context on the guidance, kind of step back on that and then -- and hopefully help frame your question. So we provided an early framing for 2024 on our last call, and we had the insight on how Q4 played out and have completed our detailed planning work with our businesses. Through that process, our view on the market outlook has not changed significant.', ""The guidance is not significantly different from the initial framing that we provided. It includes the latest view on FX, both rates and expected mix of revenue and cost by currency. That increased revenue from our initial framing, but no impact on operating income, which reduces our margins by 20 basis points from that initial framing. And then from an operational standpoint, I think the only item of note that's changed in the past three months is a discrete item in our pharma services business."", ""We're transitioning some of our sterile fill finish capacity from COVID vaccine support to GLP-1 support. Would have been expecting to recognize an upfront fee in Q1 2024. Now the accounting is finalized, we expect to recognize that benefit in line with production, which actually starts in 2025. So it shifted approximately $0.20 out of Q1 2024, and that's had some impact on -- in terms of the reported core growth."", ""And then one other comment on the guidance is that we thought it best to provide a range, not a point estimate. So things are more helpful for our investors and the range of outcomes for the year. Now the range doesn't encapsulate every possible scenario for the year, but it does capture the reasonably likely scenarios of how the year can play out as we see it today. And the range is about $1 billion to a revenue and $1.05 of adjusted EPS, which I think is appropriate given the scale of the company."", 'But hopefully, it kind of tees up kind of the framing for the guide.', 'Derik De Bruin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""OK. And a little bit more, how should we sort of think about the segment margins as we go through, I mean, I'm just sort of looking -- I mean you've seen really good progress in LSS, and it may seem a good progress in your margins, expansion of margins across all of them. But I'm just sort of thinking about how should we think about LPS and given where you were in the -- is that 14% margin range that we're seeing for the full year, is that sort of sustainable, does that fall back next year, I'm just trying to figure out where the margin hit is on given relative to what our expectations were?"", 'Stephen Williamson -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""In terms of the margin profile for the -- we finished the year at exactly where we guided to for the full year for our margin profile for the company. And I think some of the changes in terms of Q4 versus between the segments, I don't think everyone quite understood the phasing of our revenue within lab products and biopharma services. So when I see some of the pre-call notes, this is, I think, a little bit different in terms of what some expectations. But from our expectations internally, Q4 played out as we'd expected."", ""And then from margins going forward, I think the margin profile that we have today, I'm not calling a significant difference in margin profile going forward into next year. And I think where we are on landing point on margins for the segments is probably a good starting point for the -- to think about for the year ahead."", 'Derik De Bruin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question today comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.', 'Doug Schenkel -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'All right. Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the questions.', 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Doug. Welcome back.', 'Doug Schenkel -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Thanks, great to be back. And working with great focus like you and the team. So I want to start just with a high-level LRP question, and then my follow-up is really just a clarification on LPS. So on the LRP, Marc, you've been consistent in saying that Thermo is built to grow two to three points better than the peer group over the long term."", ""That said, you did talk about 7% to 9% growth as recently as last year's Analyst Day. I'm sure the two to three points hasn't changed. But as we flip the calendar, is it fair to say that the 7% to 9% growth rate maybe is a little bit high, even in a more normalized environment, I just want to give you an opportunity to maybe just adjust that as we kind of flip the calendar and look ahead? And below the top line, you've done a fantastic job, as always, leaning operations in a more challenging period. Never let a good crisis go to waste."", ""Your guidance suggests to me, at least on the surface, that you may be investing more in the near term. But as we think about a return to normal, I'm just wondering if you think we could get some outsized incremental margin flow-through for the business as the business normalizes? So let me leave it there, and then I'll ask a quick follow-up on LPS in a second."", 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. So Doug, thanks for the question. In terms of the long-range outlook, right, we raised our outlook in late in 2021. And what that -- at that moment, we can't remember exactly what that moment was, but we were growing 25%, right."", 'We were growing at an extraordinary organic rate. And what we wanted to do was give our investors a very long-term view of what is the market and what is our position in the market, right. And in terms of our ability to gain share, three points, I think -- two, three, I use three for simplicity. Three points faster than the market is kind of the standard we hold ourselves to.', ""And we've been delivering that for a while, and we've been growing share for a really long while for many, many, many years. And so nothing has changed there. In terms of the market growth, where the market was extraordinary when we set it, we said 4% to 6% was going to be our underlying market growth, and that was higher than 3% to 5%. And the change was actually just that we had a larger exposure to pharma and biotech as we built our business capability there."", ""When I look to the future and I think about what's going on in the drivers of the long term in our industry, I feel incredibly confident that this is a 4% to 6% growth industry and that we're well-positioned to grow, for simplicity, three points faster than that, so 7% to 9%. So while I get the question a lot and obviously, in a period where we delivered 1% core growth in 2023, that's a long way from 7% to 9%. But our view on the market declining low single digits last year reflects at least a share gain component. And when I look to the future, I continue to remain very confident in the long-term health of the industry."", ""I've had some really interesting discussions with investors and basically went through the logic saying, if you're bullish on life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, you're probably at 6% long-term growth. And if you're bearish on the life science tools, diagnostics, and pharma services, you're probably at 4% industry growth. But you have to be incredibly bearish on the world to actually get to less than 4% industry growth for the long term in our segment because this -- we really are a GDP-plus-type business in terms of the markets that we serve. So hopefully, that gives you at least a sense of how we think about it and while I appreciate the offer to change our outlook, I couldn't be more confident in the future of our industry and our competitive position."", ""In terms of the below the line, the very high-level concept, I do believe that as you see volumes grow at more normalized rate, you'll see a very strong flow-through on the margins. And part of what's going on with the margins for this year is we reset our incentive compensation for our colleagues back to normalized levels after a year of below that. So just the math as you have some level of headwind embedded in the easier numbers, nothing different than we expected in October. But that's part of why you don't see as much of the margin step-up that one would expect to have."", 'Doug Schenkel -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""OK. I'm going to -- I'll leave the LPS question for another day. But I guess, the other part of my question on the margins, Marc was obviously, you got to pay people, you got to reset things. In a period where you're not growing as much, this is where Thermo has historically played offense while others have played defense to a certain extent."", ""So I'm just wondering if you're actually pulling forward some investment early in the year and that could over the next several quarters lead to even better-than-expected margin flow-through as the company returns to a more normalized period."", 'Stephen Williamson -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Doug, I think the example that I gave on the GLP-1 contract is we're basically standing up a facility for a customer. We're getting paid a fee to do that. We get to recognize that fee over the production volumes, and we're incurring substantial costs in the interim in 2024, which will create good accretive growth going forward."", ""That's one good example. And we're continuing to invest in innovation across the company. And we're not lessening our drive here to really drive great long-term growth. So we're appropriately managing our cost, top-line environment, but we're making sure that we're actually putting the right investments in place and to make sure that, that top line environment stays and the outlook stays as good as we -- as much as articulated."", 'Doug Schenkel -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'OK. I will leave it there. Thanks so much.', 'Stephen Williamson -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'The next question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.', 'Vijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Hi, Marc. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. My first one Marc, when I look at the annual guidance here, the core is flattish at the midpoint. But excluding the vaccine headwinds, it's about three points."", ""That's a pretty solid guide. The three things that have come up is China, the CRO business, and analytical tech. Can you just remind us what China and what PPD did in fiscal 2023 and is the guide assuming those three pieces, China, CRO, and analytical tech, is that at 3%, about 3%, below 3%? Thank you."", 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, Vijay, thanks for the question. So when I think about the performance of our businesses, certainly last year and certainly as we look to the future, last year, just spectacular performance in our clinical research business. Really, the team, unbelievably good job in terms of the results. I think that in a way, we probably undersold the details, not the numbers as much as what actually was going on because there's so many different things we were communicating."", ""But if I think about clinical research, it's a little over two years after the acquisition, phenomenal acquisition. Customers love the business performing well, colleagues doing a great job. And it's been a big success. The business in the pandemic played the largest role in supporting the clinical trials on vaccines, and at the same time, delivered by far the fastest, I'll call it, underlying growth, excluding all of the COVID activity, just crushed it."", ""And that means for this year, we have both a roll-off, which we've given transparency to on a big chunk of the vaccine revenue, which is fine. And we have generated a really substantial comparison, which is cool. Like we -- that's a good challenge to have in terms of the great performance. So we would expect that the business' growth would be much more moderate this year just based on the comparisons."", ""But the future, meaning looking out into 2025 and beyond, this is a really strong business, long-term, high single-digit growth business plus the synergies it's driving. So I feel really great about that. And then a quick comment just on China and which is unrelated to clinical research but sort of the other element of your question. China, market conditions were challenged in 2023."", ""First quarter was really strong, lots of stimulus, all of those good things. But then -- so that was China effectively. We're not calling for a meaningful improvement in China this year. Rather, we lap the comparisons as the year unfolds."", ""So it becomes a little bit less of a headwind. We all know that at some point, the Chinese government will create some mechanism of stimulus. Whether that's direct or confidence or whatever it does, we don't know when that will happen. But at some point, it will improve the market conditions because the needs for what we do is very high."", ""So I'm bullish on the long term being better in China than what we've been experiencing currently, and it will take some time to get there."", 'Vijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, Marc. And Stephen, just one quick one for you. On Q1, I think operating margin, slightly under 21%.', 'I think the EPS is around $4.70-ish. Is that just the outsized impact from incentive comp reset, just want to understand the Q1 margin cadence?', 'Stephen Williamson -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So when I think about the margin in Q1, that's definitely an element when you look at it year over year and kind of sequentially as well. So when I think about it year over year -- so there's -- obviously, we have a significant drag from the lower pandemic revenue and the reset of the incentive comp. That's just under 200 basis points in total and then about 100 basis points contribution from the core business despite the lower dollars of revenue."", ""And the key driver there being the impact of the cost actions that we've taken over the past year. So to give you a way to frame the margin in Q1. And then yes, the margin profile grows each quarter as the revenue dollars grow during the year in terms of the profile for the year ahead. Thanks, Vijay."", 'Vijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""It's helpful. Thank you, guys."", 'Rafael Tejada -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Operator we have time for one more question.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.', 'Tejas Savant -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Hey, guys. Good morning. And thanks for the time here. Marc, just a follow-up on your China commentary there, more in terms of the long-term opportunity.', ""You've talked in the past about that being an important market for you growing at the higher end of your outlook for the company. Recently, there's been a thawing in relations over the last month or so. I think you've kind of alluded to that as well and some high-level government engagement. But then a little while ago, we got word of this Biosecure Act legislation."", 'Can you just help us think through sort of what that entails for you, perhaps an opportunity to be more front footed and gain share in the near-term on the services side versus kind of the long-term risk of a potential blowback from the Chinese side in terms of U.S. MNCs operating in that market? That would be super helpful. Thank you.', 'Marc Casper -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. So thanks for the question. In terms of China, a market that we've been in for 40 years, a set of capabilities that we built over a long period of time that's helped Chinese society, right, and created American jobs as part of it. Better food supply, addressing air pollution, helping produce medicines for the local population, we have a great reputation."", ""I've had the honor of being the Chair of the U.S.-China Business Council over the last couple of years and interacting both with the U.S. administration and the Chinese government. And while it's clear to me that the short-term GDP environment is challenged in China, that the needs for what our industry does and what Thermo Fisher does for the long term is good. It will be a solid growth market, certainly one of the faster-growing geographies in the long term."", ""In terms of the relations between the countries, yes, I agree with your sentiment, there is a thawing. And in terms of potential legislation, there are thousands of bills that are written that don't happen. So until something sort of matures through the process, it's hard to really know whether it comes to pass and what the exact implications. And my quick read of what they're working on in this particular one, it really is basically an opportunity for non-Chinese companies to have a stronger position in serving Federal Government-related entities."", ""So that's sort of the essence of that. And obviously, as a non-Chinese company, we'd be well-positioned to support the U.S. government. So thank you for the question."", ""Let me just do a quick wrap on the call. So thanks everyone for participating in our call today. We entered this year with strong momentum. We're in a great position to deliver an excellent year in 2024."", 'As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses.

You might have heard that they're a good way to make a profit without spending much. But how much do you know about these securities?"", 'Low-priced securities are often known as ""microcap stocks"" or ""penny stocks."" Generally, microcap stocks are stocks issued by companies with market capitalization of less than $250 million to $300 million. Penny stocks are typically stocks issued by very small companies that trade at less than $5 per share. While the two categories overlap, not all penny stocks are microcap stocks.', ""Many low-priced securities trade in the over-the-counter (OTC) market rather than on an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. This means they aren't required to meet the listing standards imposed by exchanges, such as a minimum total market value or number of shareholders. While these securities can be legitimate investments, they're also high-risk, so approach them with caution."", ""Low-priced securities often are considered speculative investments, which you should only make with money that you can afford to lose. They tend to be volatile, and they trade in low volumes, which means they're subject to price fluctuations from even relatively small trades. The low trading volume of these securities also can make them hard to sell due to a potential lack of buyers."", ""A major risk for low-priced securities is the limited amount of publicly available information. Many of these securities are issued by small or emerging companies, which can make it difficult to find comprehensive information about the company's finances or business model. Without this information, it can be hard to judge whether a company might be a reasonable investment."", ""In addition, some low-priced securities aren't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Companies that don't register their securities have fewer filing and disclosure requirements, meaning that there's even less public information available for -- and therefore even greater risk with -- these investments."", 'Unfortunately, low-priced securities also can be more susceptible to fraud. Scammers might take advantage of some of the lesser listing and disclosure standards to misrepresent key facts about the company. They might exaggerate -- or even invent -- its products or capabilities, perhaps capitalizing on current events or market trends to appeal to investors.', ""The potential combination of minimal information and low trading volume can also make it easier for bad actors to manipulate a stock's price to their advantage. Low-priced securities can be a target for pump and dump and similar schemes in which fraudsters artificially inflate the price of a security and then quickly sell their shares, leaving investors facing losses."", ""This price inflation often depends on the spread of false information promoting the stock to lure in new investors, such as through social media or mass email campaigns. More sophisticated scammers might even issue fraudulent press releases or reports about the stock or the company and engage in trading to support their manipulative schemes. When there's little other information available about the company, these fakes become harder to catch."", ""If you're considering investing in low-priced securities, look out for these red flags that can signify fraud:"", 'claims of guaranteed returns or that the investment is ""no risk"";', 'overly optimistic performance projections for a new or untested company, especially in a sector with stiff competition, or unsupported claims regarding partnerships or joint ventures;', ""aggressive social media, email or press release campaigns, particularly of information that can't be reliably confirmed;"", 'unsolicited social media messages, emails, texts or phone calls promoting specific stocks;', 'a lack of current publicly available financial information in SEC filings; and', 'frequent changes of company name, ticker symbol or business model, or abrupt expansion of an existing business model, often to benefit from the latest trend.', ""In addition to checking for signs of fraud or manipulation, ask questions. Make sure you understand the company's business and the terms of your investment. Rather than relying on unsolicited marketing or promotional materials or on commentary from stock-focused social threads, look for or request written information from the company, including a prospectus, financial reports and business documentation -- and read these materials carefully. Some companies have been known to state outright in disclosure documents that they have no operations or revenue sources even as social media posts paint a rosier picture."", ""Find out whether the company issuing the securities you're considering is registered with the SEC and if it files reports. To do this, check the SEC's EDGAR database or contact your state securities regulator to see if the securities are registered."", ""You can also check the OTC Markets website to see which market the stock trades in and what the reporting standards are for those companies. Companies listed in the gray market or in the pink market with limited information are the riskiest. OTC Markets Group also uses different designations and compliance flags to provide additional information to investors about a company's profile and risk factors."", ""If you're working with a registered financial professional, they should be able to help you get all this information."", ""If you receive an unsolicited pitch to buy or sell a penny stock, use FINRA's BrokerCheck to find out whether the person or firm is registered and if they have any complaints against them."", 'Remember: Low-priced securities might sound like a steal. But too often, FINRA has seen retail investors lose money to frauds in this space. Even a web search for the name of the company or person and the word ""scam"" or ""fraud"" can be helpful. If you suspect a penny stock scam, contact FINRA.', 'When our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

That would create “tens of thousands of jobs” supporting these projects on top of the “hundreds of jobs we’ll bring to a community each time we open a new store,” he said. Furner said Walmart U.S. directly employs about “1.6 million people in this country and support many more jobs beyond that.”', 'The first two new stores under the initiative are set to open this Spring in Santa Rosa Beach, Fla., and in Atlanta, Ga., he said. Both locations are Neighborhood Market doors. “We’re also finalizing construction plans on 12 new projects we intend to start this year, along with converting one of our smaller locations to a Walmart Supercenter,” Furner said.', 'Jefferies retail analyst Corey Tarlowe noted that Walmart hasn’t opened a new Supercenter in about two years. He added that since the end of Fiscal Year 2020, the discounter has shuttered 140 locations, including 101 stores in Fiscal year 2023 through the end of the third quarter. Recent closures were in urban areas of Chicago and Portland. According to Tarlowe, the “opening of new stores will help Walmart’s growth prospects ahead, while the company also invests in profit-generating efficiencies across the enterprise.”', 'Historically, the discounter has gone through periods where it has accelerated store openings, such as from 1999-2001 and 2012-2015, and years when it has not, particularly from 2004-2007 and 2016-2017. Tarlowe described the current plans as a “net positive.”', 'On Tuesday, Walmart revealed its stock will split 3-for-1, with shares to be issued after the market closes on Feb. 24. The last stock split was a 2-for-1 in March 1999. Talowe said Walmart’s outstanding shares will grow from 2.7 billion to 8.1 billion. Separately, in addition to the stock split, Walmart also said that store managers will be eligible for up to $20,000 of stock grants annually.', 'Both the new and remodeled stores will reflect the discounter’s Store of the Future concept. That means the locations will have improved layouts, expanded product selections and innovative technology to help store associates better assist customers. “Customers love this concept in the places we’ve already rolled it out, and we’re excited to transition more and more of our fleet,” Furner said. In addition, the new stores will be designed with sustainability in mind, such as more energy-efficient equipment and lighting. And locations are expected to include electric vehicle fast-charging stations for the convenience of shoppers and store employees.', '“These new and remodeled stores will better enable us to meet and exceed customer expectations whether in a store, online at Walmart.com, or through one of our mobile apps,” Furner added.', 'A research note from Tarlowe last August indicated that the new remodel of a Supercenter he toured included digital displays, wider aisles, mannequins and updated fixtures. Remodeled stores also include additional curbside capacity.', 'Separately, Walmart has been looking at other ways to make shopping more convenient for customers. In its third-quarter earnings report, the retailer said it was able to cut “store-to-home” delivery costs by 15 percent, a move that helps it with margins. It also partnered with supply chain management firm Bamboo Rose to develop and implement an enterprise sourcing platform to improve how the discounter does business with tens of thousands of suppliers around the world, with a single platform expected to enable buyers to make more informed decisions based on volume and cost. And, in an example on its big bets on fulfillment, it installed in 40 stores in-store parcel stations—turning stores into mini post offices—to expedite last-mile delivery just in time for the holiday season.']"

Parrell', ""Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 results and the outlook for 2024. I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance in 2024 operating expectations and followed by Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, will give some color on our capital allocation activities in the transactions markets, and then finally, Bob Garechana, our CFO, will review our 2024 guidance and our balance sheet, and then we'll take your questions. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance, which was in line with our October expectations. Our performance in 2023 was supported by a strong employment situation more than 2.7 million new jobs created. And while the 2024 outlook for overall jobs is more muted, we should benefit from a continued low unemployment rate for the college educated which currently sits around 2.1% as well as continued good real wage growth. We will also benefit in 2024, having low exposure to new supply in the vast majority of our markets, particularly when compared to the Sunbelt markets as well as the customer comfortably able to pay our rents with current rent to income levels at about 20%. Overall, with low unemployment and rising real wages, our target renter demographic remains in good shape. They are likely to rent with us longer as the prospect of homeownership in the near term seems less likely. With scarce inventory and relatively high mortgage rates, and 8% of our residents who moved out they bought home as a reason to depart in 2023, which is the lowest we have seen since we started tracking the number. And over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across our country sets us up for good long-term demand. Drilling down on the West Coast, we do see clear signs of improvement in quality of life and energy in the street in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. We continue to believe a recovery in rental rates in the downtown submarkets of these metros is coming and expect our shareholders will benefit from catch-up rental growth in these places where rents are still at or a fair bit below 2019 levels and where incomes, both on a nominal and real basis have risen substantially since 2019. So while we have not baked the material improvement in Seattle and San Francisco performance in our 2024 guidance expectations, we do note that other urban centers damaged by the pandemic and other negative trends, for example, New York City, reignited quickly and sharply off of depressed rent levels once quality of life and employment conditions improved. Switching to the cost side of the equation, our consistent ability to grow expenses and overhead more slowly than our competitors will preserve cash flow for our shareholders as rent growth slows across the country and positions us well once growth picks back up. As it relates to capital allocation, before Alex goes through the details of our recent transaction activities and our view of forward market conditions, I do want to highlight that we bought back some of our stock in the fourth quarter for the first time in many years. We bought back a little more than 864,000 EQR common shares for a total of about $49 million spent at about $57 per share. We funded this repurchase activity with proceeds from sales during January of less desirable assets that were on average 40 years old and were sold at a 5.6% disposition yield and believe that at this stock price and funded with these disposition proceeds, buying our shares makes a very good investment, especially given the lack of available assets to acquire at reasonable prices. Before I turn the call over, I want to thank our teams across the company for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and producing strong results for our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis."", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Thanks, Mark. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter 2023 operating performance and our outlook for 2024. We produced same-store revenue growth of 3.9% and same-store expense growth of only 1.3% in the fourth quarter, both of which were in line with our expectations. On the expense side, our low growth in the quarter and full year 4.3% growth were helped by modest property tax cost as well as the savings produced as we continue to roll out initiatives focused on creating operating efficiencies and a seamless customer experience. On the revenue side, the momentum in December was a little better than we thought as sequentially, we grew revenue in the fourth quarter by holding on to more occupancy while maintaining positive blended rate growth. This set us up for a good start in 2024. Demand was solid across our markets and consistent with seasonal expectations. We finished the year with same-store physical occupancy at 96% as we focused on building up occupancy in the slower part of our leasing cycle. Today, the portfolio is above 96%. As expected, we saw new lease rates go negative in the quarter as they typically do. Meanwhile, renewal rates for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which was slightly above our expectations. Together, this resulted in a fourth quarter blended rate growth of positive 80 basis points. These healthy fundamentals led to outstanding revenue growth in our East Coast markets and good growth in Southern California. As has been the case all year, the East Coast markets outperformed the West Coast and by and large, will likely continue to do so in 2024. As you saw in our earnings release, we have provided 2024 same-store revenue guidance range of up 2% to 3%. The building blocks for this growth starts with embedded growth of 1.4% and a midpoint assumption that both physical occupancy and cash concessions remain consistent with that of 2023. We expect the year to follow the traditional pre-COVID historical patterns with rent growth sequentially picking up in the spring and likely peaking in August. Our midpoint assumes renewals for the year averaged just over 4%, new lease change is relatively flat, which together produces blended rate growth of about 2%. This is more modest growth than the 2023 full year blended rate growth of 3.1% and is reflective of a slowing job growth environment, offset by a mostly positive supply situation in our coastal markets where we have about 95% of our NOI. As you can see from the stats in the release, January is starting out the way we would expect, with new lease change improving, a strong percent of residents renewing and a renewal rate achieved that is healthy, albeit moderating a bit. While still early, all of these January trends support our outlook for the year, which includes a view that resident retention remains very good as a result of both the benefits of a centralized renewal process, our enhanced data and analytics insights, and the high cost and low availability of owned housing in our markets. Turnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen in the history of our company, and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. Orange County, San Diego, Boston and Washington, D.C. will lead the pack with expected revenue growth of approximately 4%. New York and L.A. will follow closely behind. At the moment, we expect slightly positive same-store revenue growth in San Francisco and Seattle. And in our expansion markets, which reflect only about 5.5% of the total company NOI, we expect to produce negative same-store revenue growth given the unprecedented levels of supply being delivered. As we look to the individual markets, starting with Boston, with high occupancy and limited new competitive supply, this market should continue to perform well in 2024. The market is supported by a strong employment base and finance, tech, life science, health and education. New supply deliveries will be about the same this year as they were in 2023 and this is a market where our urban assets have outperformed suburban ones lately, and we expect that trend to continue in '24. New York should continue to perform well this year, but won't reach the high rate growth achieved over the last few years. Occupancies remain high and competitive new supply is limited, which led to record high market rents causing some rate fatigue to be observed in late in '23. New supply deliveries will be similar to last year with very little being delivered in Manhattan, where a large part of our portfolio is located. Washington, D.C. continues to outperform our expectations despite the delivery of a good amount of new supply. The market delivered over 13,000 units in 2023 and saw the great majority of those units absorbed. This year, the market will see a similar amount of deliveries, but demand has been strong, and we expect this good performance to continue. We are starting the year with occupancies above 97%, which is a great position to be in. In Los Angeles, we expect a tailwind to growth as we work through the delinquency and bad debt issues that have been concentrated here. We continue to make progress, although the court system remains slow taking at least 6 months from our court filing to being able to get the unit back. Bob will give some more color on the impact of bad debt net on our 2024 earnings expectations. New supply deliveries will be slightly higher this year with our Mid-Wilshire Koreatown and San Fernando Valley portfolios seeing the largest impact from this new supply. Strong retention and solid demand will continue to aid our ability to fill vacant units with paying residents in this market. Rounding out Southern California, San Diego and Orange County should be some of our highest growth markets this year, driven by high occupancies and a general lack of housing. High homeownership costs make renting in these markets a more attractive option. San Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year. In San Francisco and Seattle, we had little to no pricing power throughout 2023, and our base case expectations for this year assume that situation continues. We have seen periods of stability and in pullbacks. Concession use in both markets is widespread, we have strong physical occupancy with both markets being above 96%, which tells us there is demand, although it is very price sensitive. As Mark mentioned, the downtown areas of both markets continue to see improvement in the quality of life but are still lacking the catalyst of return to office and/or job growth. New supply in San Francisco this year will be up from last year levels, mostly due to an increase in the South Bay, although continued healthy demand in this submarket should aid the absorption. Seattle is likely to be the most impacted of any of our established markets when it comes to new supply deliveries with increases in both the city of Seattle and the East side. The lack of expected job growth combined with this new supply have driven our low expectations in Seattle for 2024. Both Seattle and San Francisco continued to see less than normal inbound migration. Seattle in the fourth quarter, however, did see some relative improvement with new residents coming to us from out of state. This positive trend is something that we will keep an eye on as we move through the spring leasing season. Drawing new residents back to the MSAs in both Seattle and San Francisco would be a catalyst for these markets to outperform our expectations. In the expansion markets, our long-term outlook remains positive. That said, high levels of new supply are already pressuring rents and is likely to continue throughout 2024. At present, we are operating from a defensive position and starting the year with occupancies that are 2 to 3 percentage points above the market averages. Denver has demonstrated the most stability despite having limited pricing power in the portfolio and we expect the market to produce slightly positive same-store revenue growth in 2024. Currently, Atlanta is using the least amount of concessions, but we expect a few of our assets to be very challenged due to the sheer number of lease-ups in close proximity, which will likely lead to negative revenue growth for the year. In Texas, Dallas and Austin have widespread concession use, and we expect all of our assets to experience direct pressure from new deliveries all year long, resulting in negative same-store revenue growth in these markets. So putting all of these factors together, our overall same-store revenue outlook for 2024 right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets and Southern California, which collectively is almost 70% of our NOI. We expect our coastal existing markets to outperform our expansion markets where unprecedented supply will impact operations near term. On the initiative side, in 2024, we will continue to focus on producing operating efficiencies and driving other income with projects tied to flexible living options, parking, renters insurance and monetizing technology deployed for the benefits of our residents. We are almost complete with the rollout of smart home technology across our portfolio, which will create further opportunities to share teams across properties and enable additional self-service options for residents. This, along with other ancillary income should lead to total other income growth of 30 basis points, excluding bad debt. As we sit here today, we like our positioning and look forward to capturing the opportunities the spring leasing season brings, which will help frame pricing power for the full year. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results. With that, I will turn the call over to Alex to walk through our capital allocation activities and the transaction market."", 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""Thank you, Michael. Despite an unsettled transactions market, we remain steadfast in our efforts to continue to reposition our portfolio by increasing our presence in markets like Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Austin and Denver, and expect to see more opportunity to do so as the year progresses. As we underwrite potential acquisitions, we are always mindful of heightened levels of supply pressuring rents in our expansion markets and reflect tempered rent growth and concessions as needed in our projections. Currently, the transaction market remains unusually choppy, with volumes down 60% to 70% compared to 2022 and down 40% to 50% compared to a more typical year like 2019. Nonetheless, pressures on sellers to transact continued to mount as does the volume of new developments being delivered in these markets. New developments in particular, are often not capitalized to be held for the long term. And even with rates decreasing over the last few months, carry costs are high. Owners of stabilized assets will also see pressure to transact as loans mature and extensions that were agreed to with lenders last year expire. Despite the short-term operating challenges in our expansion markets, we remain committed to broadening our footprint in markets that will see strong job growth and household formations over time and lower regulatory risks. As regards to our own transactions activity, we didn't acquire any assets in the fourth quarter, but we did sell three, a small property in Seattle, one in the Bay Area and one in L.A. On average, the properties were 40 years old and total sales proceeds were $185 million at an average 5.8% disposition yield. While transaction volume overall is very light, we are seeing some opportunities to lighten the load of noncore older assets, primarily in our West Coast markets. Since the beginning of 2024, we've sold two additional properties, one in Southern California and a small deal in Boston for a total of $189 million at an average of 5.6% disposition yield. We've allocated a portion of the capital from these sales to the share buyback activity Mark just mentioned. With ample access to capital either through asset sales or debt issuance and a property management presence in our expansion markets, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. In terms of anticipated volume, our guidance for 2024 is $1 billion for both acquisitions and dispositions but market conditions will dictate whether we can hit or even exceed these goals. Turning to development. In 2024, we'll complete six new apartment properties with a total cost expected to be $624 million and consisting of 1,982 units with lease-ups commencing for two of those projects in Q1 and four in Q2. Three of those lease-ups all through our joint venture program with Toll Brothers are in Dallas, while the remaining three, two in Denver and one in suburban New York City are JVs with other developers. Given the timing for completion and lease up, we don't expect meaningful contribution to NFFO growth in 2024, but would expect these projects to contribute more to 2025 growth. While our suburban New York project will see limited competition from new supply, not unexpectedly, our lease ups in Dallas and Denver will see substantial new competition. We acknowledge that the competition may be challenging and anticipate that as we may have to adjust pricing and concessions to meet the market, our projected stabilized yields, which at initial underwriting, will on average a mid-6, maybe closer to 6. We believe these lease-ups, once stabilized and past the current supply glut will provide good cash flow growth and be solid long-term investments. Beyond these deliveries, we will be very selective about starting any new projects with a primary focus on locations where it's hard to buy such as suburban Boston. I'll now turn the call over to Bob."", 'Robert A. Garechana', ""Thanks, Alex. As Michael and Mark mentioned, 2023 ended up right in line with our forecast last quarter. So let's get right to guidance. Michael gave you most of the building blocks for same-store revenue, but I'll finish up with bad debt, walk through drivers of same-store expenses and normalized FFO and conclude with the balance sheet. In 2023, we were able to reduce bad debt significantly once the regulatory environment became more constructive. While we continue to work with nonpaying residents as we have during and after the pandemic, ultimately, we still ended up processing a high volume of skips and evicts. In fact, about 1.5x pre-pandemic activity levels, which, coupled with not adding significant amounts of new nonpaying residents, helped us reduce bad debt as a percentage of same-store revenue from well over 2% to just under 1.5%. So great progress overall, but still a long way from the 50 basis points we were accustomed to pre-pandemic. Much like last year, we expect 2024 to continue to show improvement. We also expect the pace of this improvement to be dependent on the speed of the court systems, primarily in Southern California, where delinquency remains highest to quickly process evictions, which is a hard thing to predict. As a result, our guidance assumes that 2024 remains another transition year for bad debt and that we don't get all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, our guidance midpoint assumes that full year bad debt as a percentage of same-store residential revenue is slightly above 1% or a 30 basis point contribution to 2024 growth overall. If that plays out by the end of 2024, we would expect to be a little under 2x pre-pandemic levels. Turning to expenses. Expense management is a core strength at Equity Residential as evidenced by the historical performance Mark referenced. Our same-store expense guidance of 4% is also reflective of that discipline. This year, the individual drivers of growth are a little different than those from 2023. So let me give you a high-level assessment, and we can get into more detail in Q&A if required. In 2024, we expect real estate taxes and utilities to grow faster than they did in 2023, in part due to some 421a step-ups and commodity prices, while payroll and repairs and maintenance should be slower due to various initiatives and an expected normalization of inflationary pressures. Insurance, a small category at less than 5% of total expenses, but a topic often discussed should grow more slowly than last year but remain above the long-term trend with growth in the low double digits. Turning to normalized FFO. Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. As is typical same-store NOI performance is the primary driver of growth but let me provide some color on transaction activity. We are assuming $1 billion in both acquisitions and dispositions for 2024 with limited dilution yet we show a $0.03 reduction in normalized FFO growth there. This is due to our assumption that our acquisition activity mostly occurs later in the year than our dispositions. This is also partly offset in interest expense and interest income as disposition proceeds are used to pay down debt or invested in interest-bearing 1031 accounts while we await acquisitions. Now a very brief comment on the balance sheet because we're in really great shape here. We have no debt maturities until the middle of 2025, modest outstanding balances on our commercial paper program and less than 10% floating rate debt. So we're very well positioned. In fact, over 50% of our existing debt doesn't mature until after 2030. The work we've done over the last number of years has reduced our interest rate exposure and allows us for ample debt capacity to run and grow our business. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question is going to come from Steve Sakwa from Evercore.', 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Great. I guess I wanted to just maybe go through some of the building blocks of growth in '24, either for Michael or Bob. But as you kind of look through the moving pieces here. It seemed like maybe the new rate growth at kind of flattish might be one that could pose maybe a bit more of a challenge here of job growth slow. So just curious how you sort of sized all up those components? And how did you think about the new lease component with the fact that you kept occupancy flat, I guess, within the guidance?"", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Steve, this is Michael. I'll start. Maybe Bob can come over the top. So I think when you look at the building blocks for the guidance, you need to realize, one, we're giving you a range. And there's a lot of different ways you can get there, but it's really the top level themes that underline and pin those midpoint assumptions. So when we thought about new lease change, we started with the fact that we know the job growth is moderating this year. And therefore, we would expect market rents or asking rents just to be kind of less than normal across the large majority of our markets. So we kind of model a normal seasonal slope for our kind of rent trend to build and then we plug that in and we say, okay, what does that equate to? And right now, across our market, it's balancing out to basically be about flat on new lease change for the full year. Some of our markets are still positive. Some of our markets are still positive theme and some of the markets are still coming in at a negative growth through the year. But I think when you start to pull on any one of those, you need to go back to the top level themes and ask yourself okay, what's really changing. So if there's a material shift in job growth, sure. I think we would experience more pressure than we underlined and at the midpoint of our range. But again, it's when does that happen in the year? And where are we? Because today, I'll tell you, we have taken a defensive position. We're starting the year with pretty strong occupancy that really gives us some confidence heading into the spring leasing season, and we'll just see kind of what pricing power emerges from that."", 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Great. And then just maybe one question on the transaction market. I know it's not been terribly robust. But maybe, Alex, can you just speak to where you think maybe IRR hurdles are today, the 10-year sort of plus or minus 4% come down, way off the high, I realize NOI and rent growth is slowing. But where do you think investment hurdles are today, either for EQR for the market, broadly speaking?"", 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""Steve, it is Al. Thanks for the question. As you state, it's a pretty choppy market right now. And there aren't a whole lot of data points. As you know, the NMHC conference is going on in San Diego right now. So I have some pretty current time information, which is really a reiteration of what we've been experiencing in the last few months, which is a standoff between buyers and sellers. Buyers generally looking for a 5.5-ish cap and sellers generally looking for something closer to 5. So not an insurmountable gap at some point, but right now, it's hard to peg things. But assuming things kind of land somewhere in between there at a 5.25, I think most people are shooting for an 8-ish IRR. And obviously, it depends on the rent growth assumptions and the residual cap rate, but somewhere in that end, maybe a little bit less if they're going to be more aggressive."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is going to come from Eric Wolfe from Citi.', 'Nicholas Gregory Joseph', ""It's Nick here with Eric. Maybe just following up on that, so 8-ish or so IRR. I guess more specifically, you talked about obviously the Sunbelt supply and the impact that has on your underwriting on those deals, at least initially. So when you're underwriting deals both on the buy and sell side today, what are you underwriting for IRRs in the Sunbelt? And then what are the IRRs look like for the assets you're planning to sell more coastal."", 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""So I'm sorry, it's not Eric. It's Nick, sorry. It's Alex. And the IRRs don't end up being that different if you assume that sure, there's a glut of apartments in the Sunbelt right now. So the next couple of years are going to be tough. But after that, the starts already down a lot. The demand story hasn't changed. I think there's still these cities that we're interested in, that some of which are Sunbelt cities like Dallas, like Atlanta, like Denver and Austin, still are great job growth generators, still have a great long-term demand side story. So I think you see a couple of years that are tough, but then you have a pretty good few years after that. And I think you run that through your pro forma and you're roughly the same. The difference we're seeing on a lot of the things that we're selling right now and why the IRR for us is lower in terms of the hold scenario and why we choose to sell is a lot of it's older stuff. You saw that we're selling 40 years old property and they have very high capital needs. And some of that has their ROI on it. Some of it is just preserving the asset. And there may be a buyer that sees things differently, sees a little more upside. But in our case, we think the capital is better used elsewhere. So in our eyes, it's probably a 7-ish something or other. And we think that money can be redeployed better elsewhere."", 'Eric Wolfe', ""It's Eric. Sorry to keep switching people on you. But maybe just talking about coastal rent growth for a second. You talked about supply being in check, homeownership very unaffordable, solid real wage growth, job growth, okay, maybe getting a little slower. But I guess the question is, why aren't we seeing stronger rent growth today just given all of those positive dynamics? And is there anything that you think in the future would turn it around that you see that sort of more than 3% type rent growth in those coastal markets."", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""Eric, it's Mark. Just to start, and the others can contribute. I mean you look at the numbers in D.C. and Boston and New York last year were outstanding. So we're being thoughtful. We're being a little cautious going into a volatile year. But your restatement of the setup is correct. I mean those Northeast markets have steady demand by and large, minimal supply or in DC's case, strong absorption characteristics. I mean we're optimistic those markets can continue to do well. In some cases, like New York and Michael alluded to that, they're coming off really big rent growth years. In some cases, there's a little bit of a pause to catch our breath and let resident incomes grow to catch up to rental growth. But I mean, we're -- if you didn't get that message we're super optimistic about the Northeast markets, and I think they will do very well. It's just trying to handicap all the various cross currents in the economy that are challenging for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is going to come from Jeff Spector from Bank of America.', 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', 'Great. Thank you. My first question is a follow-up. I heard a comment and I think it was on the Sunbelt, ""it could be a couple of tough years."" I guess, can you expand on that? And then maybe most important is talk about when you expect supply pressure to peak, let\'s say, in Seattle. And I know again, Sunbelt is smaller markets for you, but if you have a view on the Sunbelt, it would be appreciated. Thank you.', 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Jeff, this is Michael. So I'll start. And just specific to the Seattle and the supply that we see, it is back-half loaded for us in the market with basically a lot of concentration in Redmond as well as the city of Seattle. So for us, like the peak is what we expect to experience is going to be somewhere in that back half of this year. And you could already see the starts coming way down. So I think the level of competitive pressure that we face in '25 in Seattle will be less than what we're facing in '24. Relative to the Sunbelt, I mean, this is a great question because it's going to take a while to absorb the units that are coming to this market. And the supply that we look at is fairly constant across many of the Sunbelt markets all year long by quarter, which tells us that and what I said in the prepared remarks that we expect to feel this pressure at our assets all year long. I think as you turn the corner and you get into '25 you're going to start to see that supply number slow down, but you are still going to have a little bit of the overhang of the pressure from the units that were delivered to the market in '24."", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""Yes. I'm just going to add a little bit to that. If you look at '25 expected deliveries and some stuff from '24 will definitely slip. I mean, it's about as big as '23's delivery. So it's not like '25 is an incredible decline. So what we really see, Jeff, as we look at this is still good demand in those markets. That's why we like Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver, Austin and Atlanta. But the supply picture in our experience will spend this whole year with declining new lease rates, occupancy pressure, all of those things. And you as an investor and an analyst may start to see improvement in that so-called second derivative of rent growth late this year, beginning of '25, but same-store revenue growth in our experience will be worse than '25, not in '24 because all those leases that are being rewritten will go through the rent roll and so you may be more optimistic in '25, but your numbers actually likely will be worse. So that's what we've seen with supply in our history across our markets. And then we don't really see why it'd be any different here. And I think the wildcard is if you have incredible job growth in these markets, you may be able to absorb some of the supply more efficiently and get through it more quickly. But the idea that '24 is the only oversupplied year is kind of a tough one for us to accept."", 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', ""That's very helpful. And is that why you're assuming acquisitions in the second half? Or is that just conservative approach, I guess, to the guidance on acquisitions or to your point, are you really expecting these opportunities to arise more second half '25 in your expansion markets."", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""Well, the guidance is just to help you model. If Alex can buy things and his team earlier at good prices, we'll buy them earlier. The relationship, I think you're going to see here is that prices now seem okay, maybe not quite good enough, but the discount to basis, the replacement cost, pardon me, is very good. It's the cap rate. And when you look at like 2 years of declining rental growth, you buy in Dallas, your year 2 number might be lower your cap rate than your year 1. But on the other hand, later this year, you'll be past some of that and your year 2 number will look a little better, but you're likely paying a higher price. So that's what you're going to see us navigate. We like these markets long term. We think owning the four markets that we've tabbed as our expansion markets, say, 25% of the company will create more balance and drive growth better and reduce volatility over time, Jeff. But getting into them is a little bit of an art. There's going to be a little bit that we probably do sooner, a little bit we do later. And you may feel better about the price in one and not as good about the revenue growth in the other and vice versa. But we're prepared to do that. And again, the number you see there is just sort of the guidance assumption. We'd be happy to do more if we can find more."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is to come from Robyn Luu from Green Street.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Good morning. I just want to touch on taxes. From your conversations with cities, are you hearing any markets where lower values are starting to flow through to tax assessments?', 'Robert A. Garechana', ""Robyn, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We are seeing lower values in some markets. In fact, we've gotten some assessed values actually back already as we look at 2024. And on the margin, you are seeing some decreases. So for instance, in Washington state, we saw about a 1% decrease, and we've got most of the values back there, and we're seeing it in other places. Obviously, the income -- as assessors look at values, the income production in 2023 was really quite good. But the offset there was really the cap rate change just given risk-free rates and other things. And so we are seeing some acknowledgment by assessors that values are in fact lower than what they had initially assessed at. The open item, as you think about real estate taxes for 2024 will be where rate comes. And we have rates in some places, and we'll see where they fall out in others."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""So the magnitude of where values have fallen in, let's call it, the last couple of years haven't really fully been baked in yet. They're still sort of trickling into tax assessment. Is that how I can conclude correctly?"", 'Robert A. Garechana', 'You are correct, and that makes for an excellent appeal activity for our real estate tax team as we challenge values.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""I'm glad I could help. Just on the second question, I did obviously noticed that you did some stock repurchases in the market after a long period of a pause, with, I guess, a little lesser spend in development and no near-term debt maturities, are you expecting -- or how does buybacks ran against other capital uses this year, particularly on the way that you've -- the cadence between dispositions and acquisitions for '24?"", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""Robyn, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. Our primary capital allocation goal is going to remain building out the portfolio in the way I just described in these expansion markets and lowering exposure in Washington, D.C., New York and California. Again, we believe that portfolio will create the highest returns over time, the lowest volatility and that, that will make the shareholders the most money in the long haul. All that said, we're going to continue to consider these share buybacks especially when you get this big value dislocation and when you can fund it with assets that are the least desirable among the least desirable in the portfolio against the portfolio that we think is really top notch. And we're -- there isn't a lot to buy. That's an important other ingredient. There wasn't a lot of opportunity cost here. There wasn't a lot else available to buy at prices that made sense. And all those capital structure considerations have to be thought about too, we've talked about on these calls, things like does it create a lot of tax gain, that's hard for a REIT to manage. That worked out okay for us. Bob has done a great job and his team on the balance sheet. So I don't have to worry about debt maturities that we need to kind of husband our capital. And another thing I want to introduce is you got to be careful about platform scaling, if you sell too many assets, you can really increase your overhead as a percentage of revenue. But all that said, the Board and the management team remain open to buybacks. And for us, it's hard for you to give you a formula. We're just going to kind of see what market conditions are, where the stock goes, what's out there to buy and keep our mind open to doing more stock buybacks."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is going to come from Michael Goldsmith from UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', ""My first question kind of dovetails off of Jeff's one. And if you kind of slice your portfolio between kind of core coastal San Francisco and Seattle and then expansion markets. You talked quite a bit about just the -- when you're expecting to see the second derivative and basically how long it's going to take for the expansion markets to recover. Can you put some more context around San Francisco and Seattle, how that time line compares? And if you're starting to see some of that second derivative recovery now or expect to see it in the near future."", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""Michael, it's Mark. And I think Michael Manelis may have something to add here. So we talked a lot about San Francisco on the call, the last one and why we like the market long term, feel the same way. The management team thinks there's going to be elongated recovery in that market. Conditions on the ground are a lot better. The mayor put out some information about crime reductions. They have the biggest class of police cadets at the Police Academy in San Francisco they've had since before the pandemic. So there's some good things going on. But until as Michael said, we get a little more tech job growth which talking to the team and talking to others in the Bay Area and in the city of San Francisco is probably a more later '24, '25 thing. That's probably where you get rent to take off. But the thing I want you to think about is you've had spectacular growth in incomes in the Bay Area since 2019, over 30% nominal and 12% or 13% on a real basis, yet our rents are down in the city of San Francisco, 20% since 2019 and kind of flattish to up marginally in the Bay Area. So this is a market that, like New York can really take off once you get some job growth because there isn't a lot of new supply, housing costs are pretty high. So the management team is optimistic about the recovery, the timing is kind of tough. I don't know, Michael, if you've got anything you want to add?"", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Yes. I mean I think we expect these markets to be volatile this year. And just starting off the year right now, I got both markets at 96%. We issued a lot of concessions in the fourth quarter to get there. But the fact that we got there shows us there is demand in the marketplace. And as we think about even like the new lease change. So both of those markets reported in December about a negative 8% new lease change. When you look at the January results, they're now both at about a negative 3.5%. So it's a pretty material shift. So the setup heading into the spring leasing season is really good. But we've been there before, and we've seen those markets kind of hit a pause and then kind of retrench a little bit. So that's why we're just being a little cautious. We're going to wait until we see probably a couple of consecutive quarters of improving fundamentals before we kind of change some of our long-term kind of modeling on those markets. The other thing I would just add besides the value proposition at San Francisco is Seattle benefits from having like the lowest rent-to-income ratios out of all of our coastal markets. So we just see this opportunity and the fundamentals for those markets to recover. It's just like Mark said, it's hard to pinpoint when."", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""Yes. I forgot to mention something on Seattle, I just want to throw out there. Seattle's nominal wage growth since 2019 is 40%, right? Yet our rents in that market are up 7% and downtown, they're flat. So again, these markets have the ability to pay more for great quality housing. And again, Seattle is a supply push this year. But after that, it gets a lot lighter. So that's about 1/3 of our portfolio, Seattle and San Francisco, and I hope, Michael, we're talking about that second derivative towards the end of this year for you, but we haven't embedded that into our guidance."", 'Michael Goldsmith', ""Got it. Very helpful, guys. And then my second question is just related to bad debt as a percentage of revenue, it was flat sequentially. I think there's an expectation that it could be choppy, but continue to trend down. So what's assumed in guidance for 2024? And do you expect a continued slow and steady pace of improvement? Or should we expect that to kind of to get better in a specific quarter or just any sort of visibility around the piecing of improvement?"", 'Robert A. Garechana', ""Yes. I'll grab that. Michael, it's Bob. So to start with what's assumed in guidance, we do assume that we will get -- we will improve. So we ended the year at, call it, 1.4% of bad debt as a percentage of same-store revenue. I think I said in my remarks, we expect to get to 1% -- a little over 1% for the full year. That means that by the fourth quarter, we're assuming that we're sub 1%. You're correct in the kind of 3Q to 4Q in 2023 being flattish. And what I would caution and is that it is -- this is a thing that is very hard to predict because of the court systems. It has puts and takes. It is more of a step function than a linear kind of improvement function associated with it. So our expectations and guidance is that Q1, which we're in right now is more flattish and that you started seeing improvement later in Q2, Q3 and Q4, because of that kind of pace of the court system and because there's always been a little bit of seasonality in this number. As you think about like post holidays, bad debt in the first quarter is always -- are typically a little bit higher anyways. So expect a little bit of a choppy step function, but expect improvement overall."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is going to come from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo.', 'James Colin Feldman', ""Great. So I guess just thinking about your comments on Sunbelt versus coastal. You think about the assets you bought last quarter 1 year old, selling assets that are 40 years old. How much of your view on those markets is tied to just the types of assets you own? Are these -- if they're newer assets, are they in lease-up, where it means you have more concessions, more challenging to get leased up. Is there some of that bias in the numbers you're putting out? Or would you say your view of what you're seeing in coastal is truly viewed across the markets?"", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""Yes. Thanks for that question, Jamie. I guess I attack in another way by certainly lease-ups are different. But remember, the numbers we're telling you are same-store numbers, so they won't include lease-up conversations. But I would say we have relatively small portfolios in those markets. So if one property is being hit hard, it could be one out of eight of our same-store assets in Denver. So I think that is it. I think different people, obviously, different parts of the market feel it differently. So that would be my comment. We have relatively small portfolios. I mean, Austin, we have three same-store assets. So..."", 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""And Jamie, this is Alex. I would just add that when you're in a market, though, that's got so much supply, and these are historic amounts where concession levels start to get more than 2 months or really excessive I think everyone gets impacted, whether you're a B property or an A property. I can't see how you're immune from some of that pressure."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. That's very helpful. And then as we think about the investment market, I mean, clearly, the debt markets are coming back pretty quickly. We've now seen some real estate M&A. So I assume competition is going to get harder for the types of assets you'd like to acquire in '24 and beyond. How do you think about the importance of just transitioning the portfolio as soon as you can versus really hitting that right number? Do you think maybe your underwriting assumptions have to loosen up a little bit, just so you can achieve some of your strategic goals over the next couple of years if the market gets more competitive?"", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""We're -- we'd love to move more quickly in completing our repositioning. I don't feel any need to do that by selling assets cheap. I think you'll continue to see us, pardon me, sell assets that are a little bit less desirable from our point of view. It's more about the difference, Jamie, between the sale and the buy. If we can sell things well, we can pay up a little bit on the buy side. And again, we're creating that diversification, we value. So it's a little bit about if we're doing trading like that, it's going to depend on both the sale price and the buy price. The extent we try and expand the company through debt activities, then the interest rate that Bob is borrowing at is going to become more relevant. So I think right now would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% for 10-year money. So well, that's helpful, but we'd like to move faster. We point out that since 2019, when we started this, we've moved billions of dollars of capital into those markets, but the transaction markets have been closed for half of the last 4.5 years because of COVID and because of the Fed. So we're hopeful that in a wide open year, I mean we did, I think, $1.7 billion back in '22. We're capable of doing $2 billion plus a year for sure. if the opportunities present themselves and we push the gas hard, it's got to make some sense. De minimis dilution is one thing. Wholesale dilution would require some sort of justification that we could get on this call, and you all would feel was compelling."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. So it sounds like it's more about the dilution than it is the absolute cap rate or the absolute IRR."", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""We would accept some dilution to complete our strategic repositioning. The IRR matters. I mean these deals got to make sense. We like owning newer assets because we'll have less capital. At the end of the day, the portfolios we will own in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and Austin will be the youngest portfolios of our REIT competitors. We think that's beneficial to our shareholders on the IRR CapEx side, not just on the NOI side. So yes, we want to push the gas on this. We want to move this along. The IRR matters, the cap rate matters, dilution matters, but getting it done matters a lot."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is going to come from Brad Heffern from RBC.', 'Bradley Barrett Heffern', 'In the prepared comments, you mentioned some increased price sensitivity in New York late in the year. Can you add some color on that and talk about what gives you confidence to rank that market relatively high for 2024.', 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Brad, this is Michael. So I think in the prepared remarks, I was saying we saw just that the overall market level, there was what I would describe as just like rent fatigue, where you started to see certain types of units, one bedrooms all of a sudden hit a price point at like $4,000. And it's just kind of the activity level slowed, the renewal conversations became a little bit more challenging. So I would say we still expect pretty good growth out of New York in 2024. We're just saying we're tempering those expectations a little bit. The fundamentals there would all suggest that you have pretty good pricing power all year long because you have almost little to no competitive supply in Manhattan. You've got good demand drivers in those markets. But I just think we're realistic that we've had two really good years of rent growth of rate growth that we're just kind of saying, okay, let's just take a pause on that. And let's wait until the spring leasing season shows us exactly what the market is willing to absorb."", 'Bradley Barrett Heffern', ""Okay. Got it. And as a follow on to your earlier comments about wage growth on the West Coast versus where rent has gone, I guess, how much of that opens up an opportunity for future rent growth versus how much of that just reflects that those markets have become unaffordable before the downturn, and they've been semi-permanently repriced."", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""I guess we'll see. Our sense, again, from all our comments on San Francisco and Seattle is that they still are appealing places for our demographic to live that people will want to live in the center of those cities and the whole market. And that I don't know about some sort of wholesale repricing. You saw New York recover smartly on the rent side, and there's some deals going on in the investment sales market that would support New York trading at a lower cap rate as it historically has than the national average. So I think the story is yet to be told on the West Coast markets because there's just no one selling in the urban centers, but I don't think there's an answer to that. But I think the appeal of those centers is true and obvious and will come, and we've kind of given you our view of that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is going to come from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Yes. So two questions here. First, on the renewals. In addition to jobs, I guess, renewals also seem to be a wildcard. I realize there's a frictional cost to moving, especially in urban assets. But can you just walk through your views on renewal activity for this year. And it seems like you guys think it will hold up much better than new rents. And I'm sort of curious I would think those same existing residents would see the new rates that newcomers are getting in would want a rent reduction, not a rent increase."", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Yes, Alex, this is Michael. So I think it's a great question. And what I could tell you right now is that the quotes for the next 90 days have already been issued. We do expect to continue to renew about 55% to 60% of our residents and achieve approximately anywhere between a 4% and 4.5% growth, off of about 6% quotes that are out in the marketplace. You got to remember, in the last couple of years, I mean, we put a lot of effort into this renewal process. We've centralized our renewal negotiations that's really helped us navigate the negotiation conversations with residents. We're leveraging all new processes in both the quote generation as well as the negotiations. We're layering in data science to help enhance some of these results. And right now, we do expect renewal performance to be fairly stable but we have modeled for further deceleration like later in the year. So the full year is expected to come in just over 4%, which is still a pretty solid growth, but we do expect to see some deceleration. And I think when you look at the spreads right now that you see in the markets with new lease change or market pricing and renewals, sure, there's more stickiness when it comes to the renewals. And we have a lot of great, rich history and data going all the way back to like 2006 that shows us that even when markets are dislocating, and I could use a San Francisco back in like 2016, where it was just getting a lot of new supply right on top of us, that market held up pretty well from the renewal standpoint and landed somewhere in that back half of the year with about 2% averages. So it's not uncommon to see these spreads in the marketplaces. And the other thing, I guess, I would point out is we start getting into '24, our concession use was elevated back in '23. So I can renew a lot of these residents flat in some of these expansion markets or Seattle and San Francisco and still walk away with a 6%, 8% increase on renewals. So it kind of takes away some of the spread that you're looking at and why we have so much confidence in that renewal number being right around 4%."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Okay. The second question sort of dovetails on the rent fatigue comments. It seems, I mean, using New York as an example, no new supply. People want to be back in the city. And we don't really hear stories anymore about doubling up or even moving to New Jersey, it's still an expensive proposition. So from a pricing perspective, do you feel more comfortable today sort of across your portfolio, especially in markets like New York, in pushing pricing versus years ago when renters -- and I'm not just talking about new supply, but we're doubling up or maybe moving to New Jersey or outer boroughs was something was more of an option. Do you feel like you have more pricing power today to push rents more than historically?"", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Yes, Alex, this is Michael. I'll start. Maybe some of you can layer on top of that. I think this is really a market and submarket kind of look. So it really just depends what is the spread? How much is Brooklyn's rents compared to Manhattan? What is that trade-off decision to happen? So I don't know that I'd say I have more pricing powers today than I have had historically. I would say we have really good processes in place today that help us navigate through these situations. And each market is going to deliver different rate growth based on a whole lot of factors that go into the strengths of markets. And as we look for 2024, all I can say is that the setup feels pretty good. It's like normal. The rents are doing what they seasonally should be doing sequentially building each week. Our application volume is sequentially building each week. I think we need to see that momentum in that early part of the spring leasing season to really be able to answer that question and tell you, do I feel like I got more pricing power or less than historical times."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is going to come from Rich Anderson from Wedbush.', 'Richard Charles Anderson', 'So on the topic of expansion markets, is it absolutely a fee simple type of investment? Or would you be open given the sort of the complexities of all the lending environment and all that sort of stuff and some distressed balance sheet distress and whatnot. Would you be willing to invest in different areas of the capital stack with an intention to ultimately own? Or are you going to have enough opportunity to keep it simple and just go through equity channels?', 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""Rich, it's Alex. Well, we prefer simple, if it's available, but if there's a good opportunity, that would require us to participate elsewhere in the capital stack that would lead to us likely owning the property, we're wide open for that as well. So I do think there's going to be a lot of fee simple stuff out there though. So we'll balance that out. But we're happy to talk to anyone that owns a well-located apartment in the expansion markets about any structures they have."", 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""Okay. Great. And then if I could just sort of ask the sort of a different question about what you said, Mark earlier about 2025 being a tougher year in the Sunbelt versus 2024. But then you said something like -- but the second derivative might be thought to be better. I didn't quite understand that, so maybe you can clarify that. But would you say, generally speaking, that the Sunbelt sort of recovery process is maybe a year behind San Francisco and Seattle. Is that like -- does that sort of help define the condition that you see it today?"", 'Mark J. Parrell', 'Yes. What I\'m going to say is just how we\'ve seen things play out in our markets. So the first thing that you see as you start to see a decline in occupancy when you get all of this, when you get a lot of supply or a big demand drop or both. So the markets you\'ve seen competitors in the RealPage numbers sort of show declines in occupancy. That pressures owners to give concessions and lower face rate. And then that, in turn, eventually affects same-store revenue. which is, of course, the interplay between occupancy rate renewals and the whole 9 yards. And so when it reverses, the exact opposite happens. First, you start to see on building my occupancy a little as Michael spoke to Seattle and San Francisco, that gives you a little bit of confidence. So now you\'re going to take away some of your concessions and you\'re going to try to move rate up a little, especially in the spring leasing season, you\'re going to test that. As that improves and eventually that will flow through to your same-store revenue number. So that\'s what I mean by that comment. So that this year, same-store revenue might hold up better in a heavily supplied market or a demand-challenged market because you\'re looking at a situation where your rents, you haven\'t rewritten every lease down yet. But over the course of 2 years, you will. And in that process, that second year same-store revenue number is often lower but we\'re often telling you, ""Hey, you know what, your lease is going up. We\'re feeling better in a market"". And that\'s what I\'m sort of expecting. We\'ll see how it goes, but my expectation is sometime in \'25, folks will be talking about an improvement in some of those, I call it, second derivative, but new lease rates, street rent numbers. And it isn\'t going to be dramatic right away, but it\'s sort of some solidification of that that\'s really built on occupancy starting to improve. So again, you got all this supply, our experience is it compounds. It gets worse before it gets better. And it just takes a little while to run through the entire P&L. Is that helpful, Rich?', 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""Yes, that's really helpful. And then would you then sort of characterize Sunbelt as being x money months behind San Francisco, Seattle, would you -- is it a year in your mind if you were to sort of simplify it?"", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""I don't have a prediction on that. We told you we didn't put San Francisco and Seattle in this year's improvement bucket. I have high hopes, but it feels like because of supply in Seattle and just job conditions in San Francisco, it could take a little longer. And I think the Sunbelt is just starting its challenges. So I think both areas will be a little challenged in '24."", 'Operator', 'And our next caller is going to be John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.', 'John P. Kim', ""On your blended lease growth improvement in January, can you comment on how you think these trends for the remainder of the quarter? I realize you expect it to improve in the second quarter. And if there's any discrepancies in the market performance versus what you had in the fourth quarter as shown in Page 17 of resettlement?"", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""John, this is Michael. I could start with that. So I mean, I think as you look at this, and I've cited before, just the improvement that we saw in San Francisco and Seattle coming off of December and into January with the new lease trends going from like a minus 8 in December, down to like the minus 3.5. The portfolio itself was at minus 5.7 for new lease change in December and is now in January that we put in the release at a minus 3.7. The expectations clearly is that you could see with sequential rents improving each week, that number is going to continue to drop as you work your way through the quarter. So on the renewal side, it's a little bit of the opposite story. You saw renewals were a 5.2 in the month of December. And in the release, we have January at the 4.9, the quotes are out there, but we do expect this renewal number to keep trending down as we work our way through, somewhere in that 4% to 4.5% range is what we expect to achieve off the quotes that are in the marketplace. So I think you're going to see the interplay between these two shifted a little bit where you're going to have strength because you're going to have new lease change starting to recover. And hopefully turning positive as we start off the spring leasing season. We'll see if we keep this kind of momentum in place to do that, and you'll see the moderation of renewals, but still at a really strong number if we come in anywhere between that 4% and 4.5% growth."", 'John P. Kim', ""Okay. And my second question is on your development yields. Like you said, we're trending closer to 6%, given higher concessions. Can you comment on the level of concessions that you're providing today? And is this really driven by your Texas and Denver developments? Or is this broad-based?"", 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""John, it's Alex. Well, we are literally just starting up our lease-ups right now. So we don't have a lot of data yet. We are assuming a month right now, but that could be flexible over time. And those lease-ups are three in Texas, one in suburban New York, which we'll probably see very little of that kind of concessions and then two in Denver."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is going to come from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley.', 'Adam Kramer', ""Maybe a little bit more of a conceptual question, and I guess, also kind of in line with Alex Goldfarb's question earlier. But just looking at kind of the new lease change by market, comparing that to the renewal change by market. It's kind of interesting, a new lease can vary pretty significantly by some of these markets, but renewals are in a pretty tight band, call it, 200 basis point band, give or take. And so I guess the question is kind of twofold, right? Is there an ability to maybe push renewals even more in, say, a market like D.C. where new leases holding in a lot better versus kind of expansion markets, right, or San Francisco where I guess I'm kind of surprised by that historically why it's wide spread between the new and the renewal rate? And should I be maybe a little bit worried about renewals kind of falling a little bit, getting closer to that kind of deeply negative or somewhat negative new lease change. Again, a little bit more of a conceptual question, so apologies, but hopefully, hopefully, that makes sense."", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Adam, it's Michael. So I mean I think there's just more stickiness into the renewal stats that you look at this. And you're also coming off of a period of time which is low transactions. So there is a little bit of that in these numbers. I think as we think about this, I mean, like I said, we have this data going all the way back in time. It's just not uncommon in the fourth quarter to see new lease change goes negative. Even in a pretty good year with rate growth happening in the marketplace, that new lease change goes negative and renewals stay positive. So it is a really uncommon situation for our renewal growth to go flat or even think that it's going to be negative. And like I said, we've just put so much into our processes. We have so much good information and insights to it. We've got a high degree of confidence. That being said, if there's a big dislocation in the market, right? Even the deceleration that I mentioned before, could be more robust than what we modeled."", 'Adam Kramer', ""Great. That's really helpful. And I appreciate that color and all kind of the building blocks earlier on the call, too. So maybe on concession use. I know you've talked about it a little bit on the call thus far. Maybe just if you don't mind some of your expansion market. Kind of the level of concessions in terms of number of weeks that are being offered?"", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Yes. So I think I would just start by just saying that the concession use right now remains concentrated in the Seattle and San Francisco portfolio for us with about 70% of all the concessions being issued. When you drill into the expansion markets, I mean, it's such a small percent of the absolute portfolio. But right now, when you go across them, it's running between like 30% and 45% of applications receiving about a month. I'd say Dallas right now is the one market where we're up closer to about 6 weeks' worth of concessions being issued. And like I said, we would expect that to kind of continue at that level in those expansion markets and we're watching what's going to be happening with the new lease-ups and how competitive are they so that we know where we need to play. The fact that these markets are now like 96% or even some of them over 96% with that concession use that we did in the fourth quarter is really a good sign because the last thing you want to do is turn on concessions, do leasing and still land in an occupancy like where you started with? That would not be a good situation. So we feel like the setup right now is defensive. These occupancies are 2% to 3% above. We expect to issue 30% to 40% of our applications receiving concessions of 1 month to 1.5 months in those markets."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is going to come from Haendel St. Juste.', 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""I guess, good morning out there to you guys. Mark, I guess the first question for you, following up on Rich's question earlier about your potential interest in stepping in and participating in other parts of the capital stack. Seems a bit of a departure from how you've responded to mezz investments in the past. So I guess, first, is that fair? And why the change of heart? I'm assuming perhaps is reflective of the opportunities. But second, I'm assuming -- or is it fair to assume that you'd be solely focused on the Sunbelt? And then third, what level of return or premium acquisition cap rate would you seek there?"", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""Okay. I'm going to start with some of that and then Alex may answer parts of it as well, Haendel. But on the mezz investment side, I think the part that Alex emphasized was the path to ownership. So what we've been more hesitant to participate in is to just create a book where we are consistently making mezzanine loans or preferred equity investments in deals where it's improbable that we would end up being the owner. When we're working with the lender and the owner and we get in the capital structure and there's a good chance we're going to end up with the deal, that to us is very different. That is stuff we did do back in '08 or '09 through 2010. So that is a familiar thing for me and Alex and a lot of folks on the team to do. So that's how I would distinguish the two of those. I don't know if there was anything else in that question you wanted to answer, Alex, no."", 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""No, I think we're good. I mean we will be opportunistic. That's the history of our company, and we'll keep looking for chances to buy great real estate."", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""I guess I will -- you asked about acquiring assets in one form or another in our established coastal markets. We're certainly open to that. We've got some development deals we're likely to start in some of those established markets that are in areas really hard to build. But the primary focus is to get into these expansion markets and add capital there."", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""Got you. Got you. That's helpful. But a follow-up. What level of return potentially would you -- or premium to acquisitions, would you seek were you to get involved in some of these mezz or pact ownership type opportunities."", 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""Haendel, it's Alex. It's really impossible to peg that without knowing the specifics of the deal and the circumstances around it. But obviously, we're very focused on getting compensated for any risk we would take beyond a typical transaction."", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""Okay. Fair enough. One more on the expense side. I was hoping for a bit more detail on the key components. I appreciate the overall high-level thoughts you provided there earlier, but maybe some specifics on the key components like what you're embedding in your guide for specifically taxes, insurance, R&M and also for the ongoing tech initiatives. I think last year, you outlined $10 million or so of savings via that. Just curious what level perhaps we could see from tech initiative savings this year."", 'Robert A. Garechana', ""Yes. Haendel, it's Bob. I'll start with some detail on the expenses and then maybe pass it to Michael on the initiatives. I will caveat on the initiative side. Most of our initiatives, as Michael mentioned, are more revenue focused this year than expense focused, but he can touch on initiatives if I don't cover something. So on specifics related to some of the categories we are expecting, as I kind of mentioned, utilities and real estate tax to grow higher than what they did in 2023. That implies or means that at the midpoint, we'd have real estate taxes around, call it, 3% and utilities more around a 6% growth rate relative to what were lower growth rates in '23. On the other side of the equation on the big categories, you have R&M, which experienced a lot of inflationary pressure in 2023. We expect that to normalize. So we expect R&M to grow something more like 4%. That is where we are realizing some of the opportunities and work that we've done on the initiative front to reduce our dependency on contract labor and places where there's wage pressure. So that's helping us get to that 4% anticipated growth. And payroll, we think we're not anticipating as much challenges on the medical benefit side, and we're just yielding some of the payroll optimization we did was back-end loaded in '23. So we'll realize more of that benefit in 2024. Does that help you on the color side? Is there any categories I missed?"", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""No, that's helpful. But in relation to -- I believe it was $10 million that you outlined last year from tech-driven efficiencies first, is that accurate? And second, do you have a comparable figure expectation for this year?"", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Yes. Hi, Haendel, it's Michael. So let me just start by saying that really, the entire company has been focused around these innovation initiatives for the last several years. And we now have created this foundation that really is going to deliver long-term value creation to the portfolio for many years to come. With the materials that we put in that November investor presentation highlights this technology evolution of this platform really has been focused on creating the mobility and efficiency in the operating model while this seamless experience to our customer improves. All in, we've identified about $60 million in NOI improvements with about $35 million of that already achieved over the past several years. The early stages of this was clearly more expense focused, and that shows up in our numbers when you look at the low expense growth. And that's mostly in the payroll and some of the R&M accounts over the last couple of years. Going forward, we've identified and we expect about another $25 million. In 2023, we delivered about $10 million in NOI improvement, and about 2/3 of that was on the expense categories, primarily in the payroll accounts and a couple of million dollars of that was in the revenue front. Specific to 2024, we've layered in another $10 million included in guidance with about $7.5 million in other income accounts. And this is realized growth as the annualized number from all of these initiatives is greater because some of these are back half loaded, meaning I only get about half of the benefit this year. So overall, I guess I would just say is this operating foundation is almost in place. and you really should expect that the future years are going to continue to have more revenue enhancement opportunities. But the reality is, I mean, we're never really done with this pursuit of operational excellence. It's something that's wired into the DNA of our company. And I'm sure as this year goes on, we're going to identify new things for future years as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is going to come from Rob Stevenson from Janney.', 'Robert Chapman Stevenson', 'Alex, can you talk about how robust the market is for dispositions in quality of life areas like Urban Seattle, San Francisco or markets with ongoing bad debt issues like LA are things trading and where are they pricing versus a few years ago if they are?', 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""Yes. Thanks, Rob, it's Alex. There's almost no activity in the markets you listed. I mean, we test from time to time, not saying we wouldn't sell something, but right now, I don't -- I couldn't tell you what market cap rates are because they just haven't been freed. So it is really frozen there. So frankly, we've concentrated our efforts elsewhere."", 'Robert Chapman Stevenson', ""And I mean is that just hold on for a couple of years, hope that the cities get their act together? Or is there something else just simply by lower priced capital that will allow that to sort of come back? Or are there -- you're anticipating some sort of level of permanent impairment on some of those markets and submarkets."", 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""No. I think all of the things that you mentioned are likely to happen. There's a tremendous amount of capital on the sidelines. These cities are still great cities. The cities themselves are doing a lot. Particularly in San Francisco and Seattle to improve the quality of life. I mean they're making some really serious headways. And as Mark talked about, we expect them to recover as the jobs recover, but even absent that, we're at 96% occupancy. It's just investor sentiment is really negative right now, and we think that there are better opportunities elsewhere, and we're frankly a buyer of what it sounds like people would transact right now."", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""And Rob, just to add to that, I mean, these markets, Seattle and San Francisco, particularly though, you could think about downtown L.A. too. We may have powerful drivers. For us, it's like we talked about New York, when everyone was down on New York City, and we were positive on it still. That recovery has been vibrant. I think it's the same pattern here. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. And I think these markets will recover greatly on the rental side over the next few years. What we shied away from on this call is excessive enthusiasm too early in the year when you're not really into the leasing season yet in markets that do have volatility associated with them. So I don't feel any sense of permanent impairment in these markets at all. I think that you're going to have great rental growth, you're going to have a recovery that's pretty strong in these markets. And you are likely but not certain to follow a pattern like in New York, where, again, the investment sales market has some deals in it in New York, and they're trading really well. And so I'm not sure why in a few years San Francisco and Seattle wouldn't trade very well as well. But it's just going to take some time. And again, our hesitancy here is really around the time line for this, not the occurrence of it. And I think it's a catalyst for our investors. I think having a portion of the portfolio in unrecovered markets with rents lower than they were in '19 and income is a lot higher is a huge potential piece of kindling wood to our earnings in future years."", 'Robert Chapman Stevenson', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly for me, Bob, what's the $0.06 difference between day REIT normalized FFO guidance? Is that one or two large items that you're expecting or a bunch of small ones given what you know today?"", 'Robert A. Garechana', ""Yes. There's one larger contributor, which I'll talk about, which is advocacy costs. So we are forecasting higher levels of advocacy costs in 2024, given that it's an election year and some of the balance sheet -- ballot initiatives, sorry, that we are facing, which is not atypical as another election years. And then the remaining pieces are typical forecast for pursuit costs and other items."", 'Robert Chapman Stevenson', 'Is that advocacy in California? Or is there other markets as well? Or is that entire spend out there?', 'Robert A. Garechana', ""It's predominantly California."", 'Robert Chapman Stevenson', ""Okay. And is there anything, I guess, related to that, that you're especially worried about this cycle? I mean, I know that a lot of this stuff keeps being put on every other ballot or every ballot. But I mean, is there anything that's looking like this year or '24 is the chance that it really passes, it would wind up being a negative for you guys?"", 'Mark J. Parrell', ""Rob, it's Mark. I mean, there's negatives and there's positives in the regulatory area. The ballot measure is by far the biggest point of focus in the industry. And just to remind everyone, this has been on the ballot twice before, the citizens of California rejected it by 20 percentage points each time. The industry is well organized. We're going to make the same good arguments about supply being the solution, more rental voucher funding being the solution. And to be honest, the Governor Newsom and the legislature have done a lot of supply things with the accessory dwelling unit legislation, with some of the zoning reforms. And so to be honest, when I turn to the positive on the regulatory side, people hear us. They hear the industry's point about supply, about zoning reform, Governor DeSantis obviously couldn't be more different than Governor Newsom. He has done some great things in Florida as it relates to housing policy as well and zoning reform to allow more affordable housing to be built. Governor Hochul in New York was trying the same thing and got a lot of resistance, but we hope that is still in place. So California is, to answer your question, the focal point of us and the industry at large this year. But markets like New York and Massachusetts and Colorado, there's always dialogue going on in those markets. but we're well organized to have that conversation. And I think policymakers by and large understand that supply is the answer, not rental regulation. That's what I think is the positive here. You hear about that a lot more in our conversations and the reaction to rent control is something that we talk through and you get a lot of people calling the other direction after they've heard the arguments."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Anthony Powell.', 'Anthony Franklin Powell', ""A question on new and renewal lease spreads and the leases. I'm curious what's the absolute, I guess, rent, these two customer groups are paying in terms of both gross and net effective? I'm trying to understand better about what the actual numbers are for these two customer groups."", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Anthony, this is Michael. Can you ask that again? I'm not sure I'm following. The absolute rent part of the equation."", 'Anthony Franklin Powell', ""So in terms of this new and renewal leases on absolute rent. Is there a big difference between the two? Are customers paying lower or higher on renewing or new leases? I'm trying to get a sense of the absolute pricing difference between the two groups of customers."", 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Yes. I think when you look at it on the new lease side, because of the concessions that we're offering in some of them, I think it lowers like the net effective rate when you look at the absolute average of all the leases that we wrote versus the renewals."", 'Robert A. Garechana', ""And one thing to keep in mind too, Anthony, is when you're looking at the spread, so if you're starting with market rate rents, right, and looking at market and that's kind of your pricing trend or whatever, spreads can vary materially depending on who is in the mix of moving in and moving out. So if I have lived in a unit for 1 year and got a big concession as Michael used an example in an expansion market. And I happen to be the one renewing, then that spread can be very different than the absolute. So just keep that in mind as you look at any of these spreads. And then particularly, keep it in mind as you think about seasonal periods like the first quarter and the fourth quarter, where transaction activity is really low, you can have even more volatility in the number."", 'Anthony Franklin Powell', 'Thank you. And maybe one more on transaction activity. Do you expect to see any portfolio deals later this year? Or do you expect your deal activity to be more single asset as it had been recently.', 'Alexander Brackenridge', ""Anthony, it's Alex. I don't know if I expect to. I certainly hope to, and I think we probably will, but it remains to be seen. But there are some things out there that we've heard about that might be interesting, and we'll certainly be very actively pursuing them."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is going to come from Linda Tsai from Jefferies.', 'Linda Tsai', 'Just one question. In your prepared comments, you highlighted seeing stability in pullback in Seattle and San Francisco. Could you discuss that dynamic more? Is this volatility associated with job loss and return to work mandates? Or maybe just provide some examples of what drives this push and pull.', 'Michael L. Manelis', ""Yes. Linda, this is Michael. So I think clearly, job growth is one of the catalysts that does that. The migration patterns also influence that. So where you see a lot more of your move-ins coming to from within the MSA that's usually deal seekers. Those are people that are responding to seeing the concessions and either breaking their lease where they were to move into it. So it's just -- you just haven't seen like the sustained momentum that you would expect based on seasonal trends. I think last year, you saw some of those layoff announcements, you saw a lot of ambiguity around return to office where people were just waiting to see what their employer was going to do before they decided to make any kind of relocation decisions to get nearer into where their offices were. I still think some of that exists in the marketplace today. But what we did see and what we see right now is that the setup in both of those markets has positioned us with good occupancy. We are starting to pull back concessions, the marketplace still have concessions in them and we'll just watch and see that build as we get in towards March and April to see what pricing power really looks like. But there's a lot of factors that are going into why a market all of the sudden kind of stalls out and whether or not it shows you sustained momentum more in line with seasonal trends."", 'Operator', ""I have no further questions left in the queue. I'll turn it back over to Mark Parrell for closing comments."", 'Mark J. Parrell', 'Thank you all for hanging in there on this long call. We appreciate your interest and your time today. Good day.', 'Operator', ""And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", ""In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", ' See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', ""If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. To the delight of shareholders, Microchip Technology has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 56%, compound, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Microchip Technology is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.7 percentage points to 39%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image."", ""In investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Microchip Technology's forecast profits?"", ""We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$47b company like Microchip Technology. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$968m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!"", ""Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Microchip Technology for a spot on your watchlist. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Microchip Technology (1 is a bit concerning!) that you need to be mindful of."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The following stocks have been growing their dividend payments for 25 years or longer and pay above-average yields. Here's why Realty Income (NYSE: O) and Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST) are solid choices for retirement savers."", 'Concerns over consumer spending and a possible recession have sent shares of Realty Income down 18% over the past year. But the stock rallied through the end of 2023 as investors began to appreciate the stellar dividend record and quality tenant portfolio of this top real estate investment trust (REIT). Realty Income has a diversified portfolio of over 13,000 tenants that are under long-term net lease agreements with commercial clients, which provides high visibility into future dividend payments.', ""Realty Income has grown its monthly dividend for 31 consecutive years. As a REIT, it is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. The stock's current dividend yield is 5.60%, which is higher than the real estate industry average."", ""Realty Income's tenants include large retailers like Walmart, FedEx, Walgreens, and other well-known brands, and retail locations make up 82% of its property portfolio. Holding the stock is almost like earning a royalty on the retail sector, but the best part about owning this REIT is that investors don't have to worry about a rough patch in consumer spending. These companies are not going to shutter locations just because of a bad year."", ""Management's strategy is to maintain a healthy mix of strong companies that will stand the test of time. This is why Realty Income has paid a dividend for over 54 years and will likely continue paying one for decades to come."", ""Fastenal is a well-managed business that has a shareholder-friendly dividend payout. It's a leading distributor of construction supplies, including fasteners and other parts, and it has delivered market-beating returns to investors for decades while paying out a percentage of earnings in dividends."", ""The company has increased the quarterly dividend for 25 years and currently offers a yield of 2.27%, which is higher than the S&P 500's 1.47% yield."", 'Fastener distribution requires exceptional supply chain management and a sophisticated distribution network, which is a key competitive advantage for the company. Over the last 10 years, its revenue grew 8% per year, while earnings per share increased 10% annually.', ""The company's strategy to get closer to customers, with over 3,400 on-site and retail locations, and tight control of operating costs has driven excellent returns for investors. The stock has more than doubled over the last five years and hit another high to start 2024."", 'Fastenal still has a long runway of growth. It is just starting to gain traction internationally, where sales crossed the $1 billion mark in 2022 compared to $6 billion in the U.S.', 'If you need dependable growth to go along with the income, look no further. A $10,000 investment in Fastenal stock 10 years ago would already be worth $40,000 with dividends reinvested. With the company starting to expand internationally, investors could see similar returns over the next decade.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

Comprised of more than 45 million people in the U.S., Black communities have historically had a complicated, and often painful, relationship with the healthcare system. The BDO Black Community Trust Study uncovers how Black individuals think about trust and their health and identifies ways pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations can best partner with Black community members to meet their needs. The study findings were unveiled to healthcare leaders at the Community Voices in Health Equity Summit, hosted by BDO in collaboration with USA TODAY, Omnicom Health Group (OHG) and Omnicom Public Relations Group (OPRG), including Ketchum.', 'The study, which surveyed more than 500 Black individuals within the BDO community, found that more than 80 percent of respondents say honesty and transparency are defining elements of trust in health (83%). A majority also agree that trust requires healthcare providers to see and treat patients as whole people vs. just their symptoms (77%) and believe them when they describe how they are feeling (68%). In a signal to companies that one-time efforts are not effective in building trust, 58 percent of respondents say their trust is dependent on organizations demonstrating a long-term commitment to their community.', 'The study also explores what pharma and healthcare companies can do to earn trust and improve the health of Black community members. When asked what steps companies should take to earn their trust, 40 percent said hiring more Black employees would help earn their trust, indicating a growing desire for companies to reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. The survey data also highlight a desire for pharma companies to facilitate racial bias and empathy training for healthcare providers and make it easier to access patient navigators.', 'Clarity and transparency also rose to the top as key elements of establishing trust. More than half (54 percent) see pharma companies playing a role in making health information easier to understand, and 34 percent say using simpler language would go a long way in earning their trust. This desire for jargon-free, plain language is gaining greater prominence among physicians and healthcare organizations according to Ketchum, a global communications consultancy with deep health equity expertise and part of Omnicom PR Group (OPRG). More and more, they say, the conversation is shifting away from patient health literacy to the need for more equitable and inclusive language.', 'The Community Voices in Health Equity Summit held at the USA TODAY office in New York City brought together more than 70 leaders from top pharma and healthcare organizations to engage in much needed dialogue around health equity and community engagement. Panels during the full-day event covered topics such as medical gaslighting, early detection of cancer among Black men and clinical trial diversity.', 'Clinical trial diversity was also highlighted in the study. When asked what they need help with to live their healthiest life, many respondents indicated a need for greater access to health information. Half (50%) want more information on new, innovative treatments, and 36 percent are seeking more information on clinical trials.', '""Trust remains the number one gap we must overcome to achieve clinical trial diversity and health equity, and we are committed to walking hand-in-hand with pharma to get it right and move quickly,"" said BlackDoctor.org CEO Reggie Ware. ""Trust is the foundation for health equity strategies, and reaching Blacks in a trustworthy manner, in places they trust, by people they trust must be the lens.""', 'BDO Chief Marketing Officer Derrick Lane also underscored the organization\'s commitment to normalizing Black participation in clinical trials, leading with trust and educating BDO\'s 20 million audience reach on Facebook and six million monthly visitors to its website. ""We are entering new territory to meet diversity in clinical trials standards,"" he said. ""Awareness and collaboration are paramount to improve health and set up our legacy in good health.""', 'In 2024, BlackDoctor.org intends to work closely with pharma companies, community health workers and local influencers to bring awareness to its Clinical Trial Resource Center (CTRC) and engage in important conversations around health equity for measurable impact and improved health outcomes.', 'Valarie Clark, MPA Senior Vice President of Health Equity at Ketchum, says the Community Voices summit is just the beginning of the health equity partnership with BDO. ""Being able to effectively communicate with patients and communities can actually save lives – we saw this happen throughout the pandemic. Clear, simple and concise messages are most effective, but equally important is who is communicating – a valued member of the community can help establish more trust and engagement. Everyone involved in the healthcare system has a responsibility to make the complex simple to ensure patients get the care they need. Achieving better outcomes really requires all of us to communicate differently, and our summit was a great step forward in advancing that communication.""', 'About BDO Black Community Trust StudyData was compiled by BlackDoctor.org. There is a Black population size of 45 million in the U.S. The SurveyMonkey® was completed online by 500 people within the BlackDoctor.org community, with a confidence level of 90 percent and margin of error of four percent.', 'About BlackDoctor.org (BDO)BlackDoctor.org (BDO) is the leading and most trusted health platform for Black consumers, reaching a total audience of 20 million people, with six million monthly website visitors.

The high court determined the appeals court erred on a technicality when it unfroze Randazzo’s property."", ""It's just the latest development in the yearslong fight over property belonging to Randazzo, a one-time chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Federal prosecutors last month charged Randazzo with 11 counts in connection with an admission by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. that it paid him a $4.3 million bribe in exchange for favorable treatment. Randazzo has pleaded not guilty."", ""Writing for the majority, Justice Pat DeWine said the three-judge panel was wrong when it unfroze Randazzo's assets in December 2022 — a decision that had been on hold amid the ongoing litigation. The panel reversed a lower court, finding that the state had not proven it would suffer “irreparable injury” if Randazzo were given control of his property."", '“The problem is that the irreparable injury showing was not appealable,” DeWine wrote.', ""Instead, when Randazzo wanted to object to a Franklin County judge’s unilateral decision from August 2021 granting Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost's request to freeze his assets, the appropriate remedy would have been a full hearing before the trial court, the high court said.

If you wish to skip our detailed overview of Kacher’s history, investment philosophy and hedge fund performance, go directly to Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 5 Picks.', 'Glen Kacher is the founder and chief investment officer at the hedge fund Light Street Capital. He attended University of Virginia where he graduated with B.S. Commerce at the McIntire School of Commerce. He obtained his MBA from Stanford University.', 'Kacher is among the famous figures in the hedge fund industry. The hedge fund boss, who chose to base his operations in Silicon Valley rather than Wall Street, learned investing from some of the industry’s greatest.\xa0\xa0', 'Prior to starting Light Street Capital in 2010, Kacher worked as managing director at the hedge fund Integral Capital Partners under industry titan Roger McNamee. During his time at Integral, which started in 1998, Kacher oversaw investments in the technology sector. His investment areas of focus included software, internet services and media.', 'Before he joined Integral, Kacher worked for the hedge fund Tiger Management under Julian Robertson – a pioneering figure in the hedge fund industry. Kacher went to work for the billionaire legendary hedge fund manager Robertson’s fund after he graduated college with a bachelor’s degree in commerce in 1993 and remained there until 1997.', 'At Tiger, Kacher initially worked as a full-time research analyst. At some point, Kacher transitioned to the role of a part-time investment consultant for the hedge fund. During his tenure at Tiger, he focused on investments in hardware, software and networking industries', 'Kacher came to launch Light Street Capital armed with a graduate business degree, years of experience in investing in the technology space and lessons from some of the industry’s best. Kacher’s Light Street Capital is one of the Tiger cubs – hedge funds whose founders had worked at Tiger Management.', 'Light Street Capital is a tech-focused hedge fund headquartered in Silicon Valley – the global epicenter of technology innovation. The firm has $680 million in assets under management. Light Street invests by applying long and short investment strategies.', 'Being based in Silicon Valley, Kacher has had a vantage view of the technology space, allowing him to better understand industry trends and spot opportunities ahead of others. In Silicon Valley, the Light Street Capital founder rubs shoulders with technology innovators, startup founders, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.', '""What I learned at business school was that Silicon Valley was the center of the creation of the internet industry… It seemed crazy to go back to New York."" Kacher once told Forbes.', 'The Silicon Valley insights help guide Kacher’s long and short investment strategies. For example, he takes long positions in industry disruptors and shorts the incumbents. After learning that business travelers preferred ride-hailing services like Uber to traditional rental car services, Kacher went about shorting rental car stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) and made good money out of it.', 'Also, Kacher shorts auto parts stocks because he believes that the rise of ride-sharing and electric cars will reduce consumer demand for auto parts.', 'As with all other hedge funds, Kacher’s Light Street Capital has had its hits and misses. There are years that it has delivered outstanding returns and years when it has suffered overwhelming losses.', 'From 2010 through 2017, Light Street’s annualized net returns stood at 19.8%. In 2017, the fund delivered returns of 38.6%. In 2018, its returns improved to 53% in the first 10 months of the year.', 'But 2021 and 2022 turned out to be punishing years for Kacher. His hedge fund lost 26% in 2021 and things only got worse in 2022 when the fund lost 54%. In 2022, soaring inflation, Russia’s war with Ukraine and rising interest rates combined to hurt technology companies. That dealt a heavy blow to tech-focused hedge funds such as Light Street Capital.', 'Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital', 'But the fund made a strong comeback in 2023, returning 46%. In 2023, tech stocks benefited from AI excitement, which led to the blockbuster returns at Light Street Capital.', 'The AI theme is expected to continue impacting tech stocks in 2024. In a recent interview with CNBC, Glen Kacher spoke about AI being a multi-decade opportunity.', 'While there will no doubt be ups and downs, the hedge fund boss noted that AI presents a huge tailwind and opportunity for investors. He sees the AI impact on technology companies being as massive as the previous major technology shifts, such as the shift from PCs to networks or SaaS software.', 'Kacher believes that AI presents a massive opportunity for the leaders in the technology sector and that AI is an incredible opportunity for investors to deploy their capital behind.', 'As to the best way for investors to get exposure to AI opportunities, Kacher believes that semiconductor stocks present a good opportunity. He notes that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the chip companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI.', 'Software companies are also great opportunities, according to Kacher. The hedge fund boss said that Magnificent Seven companies are best-positioned to ride the AI trend. He noted that these are companies with customers, massive data and massive amounts of capital.', 'AI is going to be a big deal for the tech industry in 2024. In Davos, industry experts spoke about 2024 being a potentially big year for AI. They noted that 2023 was the year of discovery when AI proved its ability and that 2024 will be the year when focus will be on improving the technology’s reliability so that those adopting it can be more comfortable with it.', 'Apart from AI continuing to attract more money to the technology stocks, the economic outlook also looks promising for tech companies. The Fed appears to have succeeded in cooling off inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Technology companies tend to thrive in an environment of low interest rates as borrowing becomes cheap and obtaining capital becomes easy.', 'Amid the continuing AI excitement and growing optimism over economic outlook as inflation cools and the Fed contemplates rate cuts, stocks are soaring in 2024 with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in January.', 'In its latest 13F filing, Light Street Capital revealed large stakes in semiconductor stocks that are expected to benefit from AI-fueled demand. The filing also shows that the fund remains heavily invested in software companies that develop AI tools or stand to benefit from integrating AI systems into their operations.', 'With these details in mind, let’s take a look at the top 15 stocks in Glen Kacher’s Light Street Capital portfolio.', 'Our Methodology ', 'Light Street Capital bounced back in 2023 after the rout of technology companies in 2022 wiped out some 70% of the firm’s assets. The hedge fund benefited from its long positions in some extensive tech stocks that exploded amid the artificial intelligence frenzy.

As indie steadily ramps new product and design wins into production, we are confident the company will achieve its targeted model of profitability by year end, while effectively doubling revenues as it delivers on its $4.3 billion and growing strategic backlog.

Solving many crimes without their tools is inconceivable. They are mission critical. One of the best indicators of business quality is pricing power. The ability to raise price only comes with attributes such as high switching costs and a limited competitive landscape. Cellebrite benefits from both, but has not aggressively flexed their pricing power to date. After being acquired by private equity, the company’s competitor, Grayshift, has reportedly been raising prices by more than 30% on select products. Cellebrite is taking more of a velvet glove approach, offering newer products with more functionality at higher prices, e.g., their “Premium” offering, which offers additional features and is, in fact, “premium” but is also 40-50% more expensive. The combination of raising prices, introducing new products, and cross-selling analytics products should fuel growth for the next several years. Extracting data from devices and making sense of it is not going to get easier nor is it going to become less mission-critical. Law enforcement needs tools to fight crime, and Cellebrite is the leading “arms dealer” to collect and review data from mobile phones.', 'Over the course of the quarter, Cellebrite hired an Executive Chairman from the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners. It will be interesting to see if he can apply any of the “Vista playbook” to Cellebrite operations, and if he can help put some of the $230M+ in cash that Cellebrite has on its books to work via acquisitions.

Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy.

But bankruptcy is not the only consequence of the rising tide of wildfire litigation. Insurance companies,\xa0PG&E spokesman Paul Doherty said, are also reconsidering how — and in some cases whether — they will extend liability coverage to utilities in wildfire-prone areas."", ""“At PG&E, we've experienced a varied response by insurance companies in the commercial markets,” Doherty said in an email. “From some carriers opting to no longer offer wildfire liability policies, to sub-limits of insurance for wildfire-related losses, to higher deductibles and increasing premium costs for policies covering wildfire risk.”"", ""Insurance analysts say the growing risk of severe wildfires due to climate change, and a shifting legal landscape that increasingly holds utilities accountable for the damages caused by these conflagrations, has indeed changed the calculus that goes into a utility's liability insurance policy. But they're split on what that means for the long-term. Some analysts believe that the growing need for wildfire-related liability insurance will spark ingenuity, bringing new insurance products to market."", 'Others, however, believe the government may need to intervene in order to quite literally keep the lights on in some parts of the U.S.', ""“I can't say whether there will or won't be insurance, or whether utilities will have problems with coverage,”\xa0Finity Consulting Principal Rade Musulin said. “But what I will say is many of the prerequisites for an insurance market that can deliver stable and affordable prices are not met in this space.”"", 'For insurance to work, Musulin said, actuaries need to be able to do two things. They need to be able to calculate the losses associated with a potential incident, and then they need to calculate the likelihood that the incident will occur. This allows them to estimate what it will cost an insurance company to insure its clients against a given risk — and to estimate a premium that would cover those potential costs.', ""Most of the time, actuaries incorporate historical data in their estimates of potential risk and losses, Musulin said. And this is the problem insurance companies have with covering modern threats like terrorism, cyberattacks and climate change — historical data isn't representative of today's risk environment."", ""When it comes to wildfire and climate change, Musulin said the insurance industry is relatively comfortable with its grasp of the scientific issues. They have most of what they need to know about changing incidence of drought and severe winds, and how these issues could contribute to more frequent and more severe wildfires in the future. What isn't known —\xa0and what's currently creating the greatest angst for insurers — is how infrastructure designed for the climate conditions of yesteryear will perform under future unprecedented conditions."", '“The scientific [evidence] is in reasonably good shape. The question is, what happens when that climate hits something. How likely is it that thing will become damaged?” Musulin said.', ""And you can't just assume, Musulin said, that if you increase the speed of the wind during a severe storm by 10%, that the damage caused by the storm will increase by a corresponding 10%. Most structures are designed to withstand extreme conditions up to a certain point — and after that point, they fail, he said."", '“There might be very little damage up to winds of 100 miles per hour,” he said, “but at 110 the building will fall over.”', ""Wildfire risk is also impacted by a shifting legal landscape, Musulin said. It's not just that our social expectations surrounding climate, and the responsibility of industry for climate-related disasters like wildfire have shifted, he said. In the past, it was relatively difficult to determine who or what was responsible for starting a wildfire. But it's much easier if there's a camera pointed at a power line. And today, cameras are everywhere."", ""Add inflation and rising property values into the mix, Musulin said, and you're starting to raise some real questions about whether insurance — or anyone — can absorb the cost of losses that could be associated with wildfires in the years to come."", ""Alp Can, an actuary for USI Insurance Services and chair of the Climate Index Task Force that produces the Actuary's Climate Index,\xa0takes a more optimistic view of the future of commercial insurance for utilities. It's not that he intends to downplay the significance of the liability risk posed to utilities by wildfires — it's difficult to understate the potential magnitude of liabilities in the tens of billions of dollars — but Can believes the problem can be managed. What's more, he and other industry observers believe wildfire risk could spur innovation in commercial insurance that could ultimately prove beneficial to utility companies."", 'Historically, utility insurance policies have focused more on the risks associated with power generation, and less with transmission.', ""“That will need to change,” Can said, “because the risk of wildfire isn't simply a function of climate change. It's also a function of how utilities have managed their transmission lines.”"", 'This has led actuaries to work with other industry experts to develop models capable of assigning insurance premiums based on factors such as whether a utility has buried its power lines or has programs to keep vegetation from coming into contact with above-ground lines.', '“These are going to be taken into consideration, and insurers are going to make use of improvements in catastrophe modeling and location tools such as satellite space monitoring to pinpoint the level of risk involved with individual assets and locations,” Can said.', ""Insurers are also looking at contractual innovations such as parametric insurance, Can said. Parametric insurance is conditional coverage based on a specific parameter, such as, in the case of a wildfire, the total acreage burned by a single event. With this kind of insurance, the policy would kick in and cover a utility's liabilities in the event that a wildfire reached a certain catastrophic size. Wildfire lends itself well to this kind of coverage because of its binary nature, Can said.\xa0An insured property will either remain out of the path of the event, or it will be caught in the wildfire’s sprawl, in which case it will usually burn to the ground, presenting a total loss."", '“With these kinds of tools and approaches available, I would say we are equipped to handle this particular risk,” Can said. “Insurers are going to start becoming much more discerning about the potential for billions of dollars of losses, but with all the mitigation efforts taken into consideration, I believe coverage will be viable.”', ""This all strikes Mike Doyle, a senior equity analyst for Edward Jones who covers Xcel Energy, as rather good news. Insurance costs are going up, and insurance isn't something you love to see a company spending too much money on, Doyle said. But it also creates a financial need for transmission upgrades and grid hardening, and that's going to trigger a need for capital that will open opportunities for investors."", ""“It's a common theme for utilities that when a problem is identified, they find a solution. And usually that solution is going to cost money,” Doyle said. “And if regulators think it is important to fix that problem, they invest money and earn a return.”"", 'By raising the costs incurred by utilities due to poor grid maintenance, insurers could also help utilities convince regulators — and investors — of the need to perform grid hardening, Musulin said. In the long-term, he believes this will prompt the industry to invest in future-proofing the grid, which will drive down the risk and cost of catastrophic wildfires.\xa0Electrification and the growth of renewable energy will require major grid investment in the coming years, providing an opportunity to address wildfire mitigation at the same time, he said.', ""But that's the long-term view, Musulin said. It will take years to rebuild the grid, and in the meantime, he said, the government may need to step in to literally keep the lights on in some wildfire-prone areas. Because if utilities face massive liabilities in the event of a wildfire and rising insurance premiums, they may decide the most financially prudent solution is to simply shut down the grid when the risk of fire is greatest — a phenomenon that is already sufficiently common that claims against Hawaiian Electric have argued its failure to de-energize the grid makes it responsible for the damages on Maui."", 'PG&E, similarly, states on its website that it may implement a Public Safety Power Shutoff during conditions such as low humidity, high winds or dry vegetation near power lines.', 'But this isn’t the only strategy PG&E has adopted to address the rising cost of insurance and the diminished availability of suitable insurance policies.\xa0Doherty said PG&E has opted in late 2023 to move to a 100% self-insurance model in pursuit of a more cost-effective solution to wildfire risk — meaning that the company has discontinued third-party insurance and plans to use its own funds to cover future wildfire liabilities.', 'PG&E also has access to the California Wildfire Fund, which reimburses participating utilities for legal claims that result from a wildfire. The program is funded via an electric bill surcharge and administered by the California Earthquake Authority, a publicly-managed, privately funded insurance company created by the state legislature. PG&E expects that these programs will save customers up to $1.8 billion over the next four years, according to Doherty.', 'The public-private approach, Doherty said, “has been an innovative solution to protecting utilities and supporting the continued investment in safe, clean, and reliable power for California at a reasonable cost to customers.”', 'Correction:\xa0A previous version of this story erred in its description of Hawaiian Electric\'s SEC filing language.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, Systems, Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q4 financial performance and comment on our views for 2024. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. I'm pleased to report fourth quarter results with better-than-expected revenues and earnings. As of the end of Q4, we achieved several major milestones, including 17 million Invisalign patients treated, including 4.7 million teens, plus 4 million Vivera Retainer cases and over 100,000 iTero scanners sold. And for the full year -- fiscal year 2023, total revenues exceeded our prior outlook, and we delivered fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating margin above 21%. For Q4, total revenues were up 6.1% year-over-year, reflecting increased Systems and Services revenues. Strength in Clear Aligner volumes for teens and international doctors as well as continued growth from Invisalign touch-up cases, under our Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP. Our Q4 Systems and Services revenues were up year-over-year, primarily due to increased services, CAD/CAM and nonsystems revenues, including scanner leasing and rental programs and certified preowned scanner sales. Q4 total Clear Aligner shipments were slightly lower year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner volumes were down for the Americas and EMEA regions and were up for the APAC region. For Q4, Clear Aligner shipments include approximately 20,000 Invisalign DSP touch-up cases, primarily in North America, an increase of more than 60% year-over-year from Q4 '22. DSP continues to be well received by our customers and is currently available in the U.S. and Canada, Iberia and Nordics and most recently, the U.K. We're excited that DSP is proving helpful to doctors and their patients as we continue to expand the program. For fiscal 2023, total Invisalign DSP touch-up cases shipped were 73,000, up 85% year-over-year. For non-case revenues, Q4 was up 13.3% year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth from Vivera Retainers along with Invisalign DSP retainer revenues. On a sequential basis, Q4 total revenues were down slightly, 0.4%, primarily reflecting anticipated seasonally lower teens case starts, especially in the U.S. ortho channel and unfavorable foreign exchange offset somewhat by increased revenues from System and Services as well as an increase in Clear Aligner volume for adults and noncomprehensive cases and stronger volumes from Canada and the EMEA region. Q4 total Aligner shipments were slightly lower sequentially. On a sequential basis, Clear Aligner volumes were down for the Americas and APAC regions and were up sequentially for the EMEA region. The December gauge practice analysis tool that collects and consolidates data from approximately 1,000 orthodontic practices across the U.S. and Canada reported year-over-year decline for new patients, total exams and total starts, particularly among teens and kids. It also shows a year-over-year decline for wires and brackets and total Clear Aligner starts with Invisalign case starts better than the Clear Aligner brand. And the teen segment for Q4, a 197,000 teens and younger patients started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligner Systems, up 6% year-over-year and were a record number of teen cases shipped compared to prior fourth quarters. Q4 teens starts were down sequentially, consistent with historical seasonality, primarily in China as well as seasonally fewer teen starts in North America compared to Q3. For fiscal 2023, total Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and younger patients reached a total of 809,000 cases, up 8% compared to the prior year and made up 34% of total Clear Aligner shipments. During Q4, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the Invisalign Palatal Expander System, we call it IPE, Invisalign Palatal Expander for commercial availability in the United States. The FDA 510(k) clearance is for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens and adults. Full early intervention treatments such as Phase I or early interceptive treatment, makes up about 20% of the orthodontic case starts each year and is growing. Together with Invisalign First Aligners, IPEs provide doctors with a solution set to treat the most common skeletal, dental malocclusions in growing children. The addition of mandibular advancement features to Invisalign aligners also provides doctors with more options for treating skeletal, dental joint balances and bite correction and for their growing patients during their teenage years. Essentially, we now have an Invisalign digital treatment solution for every phase of treatment. IPE is currently available on a limited basis in Canada and the United States, and we recently received regulatory clearance in Australia and New Zealand where we anticipate commercialization in Q2. We expect IPE to be available in other markets pending future applicable regulatory approvals. We're also launching ClinCheck smile video, the next generation of In-Face digitalization with AI-assisted video that is expected to be available to all doctors who use the Invisalign Practice App and ClinCheck treatment planning software. This new tool is designed to help improve patients' understanding and of the confidence in Invisalign treatment and is based on iTero Intraoral Scanner and doctors ClinCheck plan for Invisalign treatment. ClinCheck smile video simulates the doctor's ClinCheck treatment plan with a short video of a patient's face, and they talk and smile, which helps patients visualize their potential new smile and can lead to a higher patient treatment acceptance. We expect to roll out ClinCheck smile video in Q1 '24 in North America and EMEA, followed by APAC later in the year. Before I turn the call over to John for our fourth quarter financial review, I want to share one more exciting news. Today, we introduced the latest innovation in the iTero family of inter-oral scanners. The iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner designed to meet the needs of doctors and their patients by offering smaller wand with unparalleled data capture capabilities for effortlessly scanning by clinical members. The iTero Lumina Inter-oral scanner is a breakthrough technology. With 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller wand that delivers faster scanning, higher accuracy and superior visualization for greater practice efficiency. iTero Lumina quickly, easily and accurately captures more data while delivering exceptionally scanned quality and photorealistic images that eliminate the need for inter-oral photos altogether. Doctors can now scan at twice the speed with a wide field of capture, multi-angled scanning and large capture distance, meaning they can capture more dentition in greater detail throughout the scanning process. To date, Align has filed over 30 patent applications covering technology related to the iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner. I believe iTero Lumina has the potential to set a new standard of care for dental practices by simplifying the scanning of complex oral regions while offering superior chairside visualization and more comfortable experience for patients, especially kids.Initial doctor feedback has been very positive, noting that iTero Lumina scanner is much faster, clear, less invasive for their patients and the imaging and visualization translates to better communications and patient experience. The iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner is available now with orthodontic workflows and will be available in the second half of 2024 restorative workflows, although we expect that GP practices can benefit now from the new scanning technology. A global broadcast to unveil iTero Lumina and provide attendees with insights and detailed information from our iTero team and early customer users is planned for February 15. Registration will open on February 1 and the link has been provided in our financial slides as well as in today's press release.With that, I'll turn the call over to John."", 'John F. Morici', ""Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $956.7 million, down 0.4% from the prior quarter and up 6.1% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q4 '23 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $12.8 million or approximately 1.3% sequentially and were favorably impacted by approximately $13.8 million year-over-year or approximately 1.5%. For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of $781.9 million were down 1.6% sequentially, primarily from lower volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were up 6.9% and primarily due to higher ASPs and non-case revenues slightly offset by lower volumes. For Q4, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and up year-over-year.On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, higher sales credits and higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, price increases and favorable impact from foreign exchange partially offset by higher discounts in product mix to lower ASP products. For Q4, ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflect the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher net revenue deferrals, partially offset by price increases and lower discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in ASPs reflect price increases, the impact from favorable foreign exchange and higher additional aligners, partially offset by a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher discounts.Last quarter, we announced about a 5% global price increase for some Invisalign products across most markets effective January 1, 2024. Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product is available in North America and certain markets in EMEA and APAC, most recently launching in China, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product and anticipate it will continue to increase, providing doctors the flexibility they want and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.Q4 '23 Clear Aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $10.7 million or approximately 1.4% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $12 million or approximately 1.6%. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $14.9 million or 1.2% sequentially and $74.6 million or up 6.1% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q4 '23 Systems and Services revenues of $174.8 million were up 5.8% sequentially primarily due to higher ASPs and an increase in CAD/CAM and services revenue, partially offset by lower volumes and were up 2.9% year-over-year, primarily due to higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and increased nonsystem revenues related to our CPO and leasing rental programs mostly offset by lower ASPs and scanner volume. CAD/CAM and services revenues for Q4 represent approximately 50% of our Systems and Services business. Q4 '23 Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.1 million or approximately 1.2% sequential. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenue were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.9 million or approximately 1.1%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet were down $4.3 million or 1.6% sequentially and down $13.1 million or 4.8% year-over-year, primarily due to the recognition of services revenue which is recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins and purchase certified preowned scanners in certain markets. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 70%, up 0.9 points sequentially and up 1.5 points year-over-year. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 70.5% up 0.9 points sequentially and up 1.2 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.4 points sequentially and favorably impacted by approximately 0.4 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.1% up 0.4 points sequentially primarily due to lower manufacturing spend, partially offset by higher freight costs. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 0.3 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher manufacturing spend and freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.8%, up 3.8 points sequentially due to higher ASPs, partially offset by higher service and freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 6 points year-over-year due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower ASPs.Before I go into the details, I want to note that during Q4 '23, we incurred a total of $14 million of restructuring and other charges, primarily related to post-employment benefits. Q4 operating expenses were $498 million, roughly flat sequentially and down 1.4 points year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly due -- primarily due to restructuring and other charges, offset by lower employee compensation. Year-over-year operating expenses decreased by $7.1 million primarily due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs, partially offset by employee-related costs and slightly higher restructuring charges. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $446.7 million, down 2.5% sequentially and down 2.8% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating income of $171.5 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.9%, up 0.6 points sequentially and up 5.4 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.6 points sequentially primarily due to foreign exchange. The year-over-year increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage and proactively managing our costs as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.6 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, the amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisition, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 23.8%, up 2 points sequentially and up 5.5 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was an income of $1.3 million compared to a loss of $4.2 million in the third quarter and income of $2.7 million in Q4 2022, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.3%, higher than the third quarter effective tax rate of 25.1% and lower than the fourth quarter effective tax rate of 63.8% in the prior year. The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to onetime benefit related to tax guidance issued in Q3, partially offset by lower U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in Q4. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Fourth quarter net income per share was $1.64, up sequentially $0.06 and up $1.10 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.07 on a sequential basis and favorably impacted by $0.08 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.42 for the fourth quarter up $0.28 sequentially and up $0.69 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities were $980.8 million, down sequentially $321.2 million and down $60.8 million year-over-year. Of our $980.8 million balance, $196.1 million was held in the U.S. and $784.7 million was held by our international entities. In October 2023, we purchased approximately 1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $190.56 per share through a $250 million Accelerated Share Repurchase. And in November and December 2023, we purchased approximately 466,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $214.81 per share through a $100 million open market purchase, both under Align's current $1 billion stock repurchase program. We have $650 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock under this stock repurchase program. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $903.4 million, slightly down sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, flat sequentially and year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $46.9 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $33.4 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $13.5 million. Now turning to our outlook. Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, we provide the following framework for Q1 and fiscal 2024. For Q1 2024, we expect our worldwide revenues to be in the range of $960 million to $980 million, up slightly from Q4 of 2023. We expect Clear Aligner volume and ASPs to be up slightly sequentially. We expect Systems and Services revenue to be down slightly sequentially, although less than the historical seasonal decline, given the launch of the iTero Lumina for ortho workflows in Q1 2024. We expect our Q1 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above Q1 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. For full year, we expect fiscal 2024 total revenues to be up mid-single digits over 2023. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner and Systems and Services revenues to grow year-over-year in the same approximate range as our 2024 total revenues. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner ASPs to be up slightly year-over-year primarily due to price increases and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a higher mix of noncomprehensive products, which have lower ASPs. We expect fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above the 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. We expect our investments in capital expenditures for the fiscal 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued expansion. In summary, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results, and I am especially proud of our continued focused execution of our product road map and innovation pipeline. We are committed to delivering on our strategic growth drivers of international expansion, patient demand, orthodontist utilization and GP dentist treatment to extend our leadership in digital orthodontics and dentistry. I believe that the next wave of innovation that we are introducing into the market will further differentiate Align and allow us to continue to increase our share of the large untapped market opportunity of 22 million annual orthodontic case starts as well as an additional 600 million consumers who could benefit from a healthy, beautiful smile using Invisalign Clear Aligners. With that, I'll turn it back to Joe for final comments. Joe?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Thanks, John. In closing, while I'm pleased with our better-than-expected fourth quarter results and start to the year, I'm even more excited about Align innovation in 2024 and our next wave of growth drivers. When I spoke to you about a year ago, I discussed the innovations that we are planning to bring to market that we continue to revolutionize the orthodontic and dental industry and scanning software and direct 3D printing. We are delivering on that promise. With the introduction of iTero Lumina powered by Multi-Direct Capture technology, we are pushing the boundaries of what inter-oral scanners can do. iTero Lumina is a combination of years of research and development to offer visualization capabilities that support doctors, clinical decisions while also enhancing their patients' comfort and overall treatment experiences. Building on more than 20 years of expertise in revolutionizing imaging technologies, the iTero Lumina scanner elevates the standard in digital scanning to achieve exceptional clinical outcomes and increased practice efficiency. The iTero scanner is at the forefront of digital dentistry. With the closing of our acquisition of Cubicure, a pioneer of direct 3D printing solutions for polymer additive manufacturing, we will enable the next generation of 3D printed products, helping to create more unique configurations for aligners that are more sustainable and also efficient solutions. We also expect it to extend and scale our printing materials and manufacturing capabilities for our 3D printed product portfolio, which now includes the Invisalign Palate Expander System. And with the introduction of IPE, we have expanded the clinical applicability of the Invisalign system to nearly 100% of the orthodontic case starts. The ability to direct 3D print, IPE will eventually lead to other direct printed products with the goal of direct 3D printed Invisalign Clear Aligners, which we hope to achieve in the next couple of years. As a company, Align has multifaceted competitive advantage, technology innovation, where we invest up to $300 million in R&D per year to bring in some of the most disruptive products in digital dentistry and orthodontics to the market in a highly regulated industry. A direct sales force that consists of 5,000 highly trained specialists, a doctor-centered model because we understand the importance of doctor-directed care, a $1 billion brand trusted by over 17 million patients worldwide and global scale and manufacturing to deliver millions of customized Clear Aligner parts every day. We are extremely pleased with our latest innovations and commercialization of products to better serve our doctors, customers and their patients. Our belief in the future business overall is unwavering. Before we turn the call over to the operator, I want to address an important matter regarding DTC or direct to consumer Clear Aligners in our industry. Align has always believed that a doctor-centered model for orthodontic treatment is the safest for patients, and we're always looking for new and better ways to support doctors as they work to create better smiles for their patients. Recent news regarding the bankruptcy of a DTC clear aligner company has led many consumers to reach out to Invisalign providers to address their unmet needs, including helping those DTC patients with incomplete treatments. To support these former DTC patients who are seeking help from Invisalign providers and practices, in Q4 we introduced a program in the U.S. and select other markets, offering up to a 50% off Invisalign case submission in Vivera Retention to help offset any additional cost to finish their treatment. We want to help everyone achieve a healthy beautiful smile and strongly recommend that individuals who are impacted by this matter seek the advice of a licensed orthodontist or dentist. Our concierge team is always available to answer questions and help connect consumers with Invisalign practices. With that, I'll thank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.', 'Elizabeth Hammell Anderson', ""Congrats on the quarter. I was wondering if you could walk us through the components of the mid-single-digit guide. I got -- for 2024. I understand what you said that like Systems and Services and Clear Aligners would be in the same range. I guess I'm just sort of thinking about like how to think about that. It seems like maybe it's like low single-digit ASP improvement and then sort of low to mid-single-digit case growth. Is that the right way to think about it? Like what else can you -- is there anything else you can sort of clarify on that? And sort of how do you expect at least currently, the sort of pacing of the year to progress."", 'John F. Morici', ""Yes. Elizabeth, this is John. You haven't framed the right way. We're looking at the segments up mid-single digits and then ASPs because of the price increase. We have some offset due to some of the lower-stage products that we have, including the DSP touch-ups and so on, that you would expect then a little bit lower of ASP impact year-over-year."", 'Elizabeth Hammell Anderson', 'Got it. That makes sense. And then separately, how has the volume in sort of market in China been progressing across the fourth quarter and maybe into the first quarter so far as you can comment.', 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Elizabeth, it's Joe. We felt good about China last year. But remember, we had year-over-year comparisons that were really favorable because of the COVID shuts down over there last year. But overall, as we exited the year, we felt good about our performance there, and we feel good about as we move into 2024 about our competitive position there in -- a China market that I think is a little more predictable because it's not the overhead that we've seen with COVID over the last, really, several years."", 'Elizabeth Hammell Anderson', 'Got it. And sorry, maybe one last one for me. Can you just remind us the sort of 1Q dip in the operating margins and then how it sort of steps up across the year. I understand the guidance you gave for the first quarter of the year, but just why that first quarter has a sort of different perspective than the rest of the year?', 'John F. Morici', ""Yes. So we wanted to give to prior year because in that prior year, when you start the year, you have certain expenses that you incur right at the beginning, payroll, taxes and other things that you incur initially some of the investments that you make that you then get leverage on as you go through the year. So it's similar to how we position things from last year in 2023."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.', 'Jeffrey D. Johnson', 'Can you hear me out there?', 'Shirley Stacy', 'Yes. We hear you fine.', 'Jeffrey D. Johnson', ""John, maybe I want to -- I'll follow up on Elizabeth's margin question there beyond just the 1Q. Let's say, you hit your guidance this year on operating margin is up nominally from 2023 level. It'd be 3 years in a row kind of in that low to mid-21% range. I think pre-COVID you were up in the 25% range or so. What's it going to take to get those margins moving back towards those pre-COVID. You've taken price increases 2 years in a row. It feels like your R&D should be coming down a little bit. Obviously, with Cubicure and that, I know you're continuing to invest aggressively, but IPE is out, Lumina now out, things like that. So just help us understand when could we start to see a path back towards getting those margins maybe up a few points from where they've settled in the last few years?"", 'John F. Morici', ""Yes, Jeff, this is John. Really, when you start to get some of that volume leverage, we're positioned as having our manufacturing and the organization that we have that's really set to drive more growth. And once we get some of that volume leverage, we should see that benefit showing up in our numbers. And it's really what we saw as we went through the quarters last year where you see some of that volume benefit. You get that benefit as well when you go through the year, but really looking to try to drive as much volume as we can and you'll start to see some of that leverage that shows up in our numbers."", 'Jeffrey D. Johnson', ""All right. Fair enough. And then, Joe, I think we've talked for many years now how iTero is carved out such a commanding, strong competitive position. You've sold a ton of iTeros over the last 5, 6 years or so. They're all probably getting, I don't know, close to their end of their useful life or so. Lumina for the first time feels like that kind of product with a better form factor, especially things like that, that could really cause some of these docs to say, I got to get rid of this big iTero and go back down to this much smaller one, and things like that, just things that would actually matter to the docs, and I'm sure the technology does this, too, I don't want to just put it on the size. But just thinking there, is this the kind of product that can finally kick off that multiyear upgrade strategy or path in iTero that we've kind of been waiting to see?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Jeff, the easy answer and the quick answer is yes. I mean it's just a brand-new platform. Now we set up -- I mentioned in my script about we have 100,000 units out there that we've sold so far. About 1/3 of those are 5D pluses, which are upgradable by just wand switch out. This is the way we've designed Lumina. And so that part's easy. Also, we've been really aggressively upgrading our installed base between E1 and E2 out there too to better position it for this kind of a move. So as we develop Lumina, we had exactly in mind what you just questioned, and we think we're in a good position to do that."", 'Jeffrey D. Johnson', ""And if you switch out that wand from the 5 to the Lumina, there is a fee there, right? It's not like, hey, you bought this knowing that you could always upgrade at no charge to Lumina?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""There's no charity here at Align. There will be a charge."", 'Jeffrey D. Johnson', 'I like to hear that. God bless capitalism.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.', 'Jonathan David Block', ""So Joe, maybe this one's for you. Video 1Q '24 IPE some markets today, but more in the common IPE should have longer term with team, docs might take a little bit of a wait-and-see approach. You talked about the new scanner. In your opinion, like is innovation are we seeing that in the '24 guide? Or is that more of like a ramp in the '25? And maybe even to take that a step further, John, for you, is there a way to sort of quantify out of that mid-single-digit revenue growth, what can you attribute to these new products coming on board in '24? I'm just trying to think about the impact of '24, is this more the ramp or the slope in the '25 for the innovation hitting?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Jon, I like the way you set that up. It's a ramp, it really is. But we feel good that we can play offense with these product lines. Now we still have to scale IPE. We have a great team that knows how to scale, and we'll get through that. Obviously, Lumina is a completely different set of outside of the computer itself. The wand itself is we feel good about the scale part of that as we sell through the marketplace. But overall, I think the way you described it is a ramp of this new technology really beginning in 2024 is a good foundation for that kind of thought process."", 'Jonathan David Block', ""And any way to quantify what's in there from the current guide or no? Is that just too difficult to tease out?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', 'It really is just too...', 'Jonathan David Block', 'Okay. Okay. So second one is maybe a multipart. But just first on the CapEx, $100 million. I mean I was really surprised on how low that number was for this year. It\'s $400 million in \'21, $300 million in \'22 million, and I was maybe even more surprised when I think about the direct fabrication initiatives. So I know the slides say hoping to print Invisalign Clear Aligner ""next couple of years"". Do we still think retainers 2H \'24, 1H \'25? When do we feel like you proved it out, so to say? And do we start to see gross margin benefits from this as early as next year, turning accretive in 2025. And then admittedly just a jump to another question. For the guidance, can you just help us what\'s embedded in there? And I bring that up because we\'ve seen this big move in U.S. consumer confidence. Europe still seems very choppy. So when we tie back to your guidance for the year, what are you extrapolating out, if you would, for the current macro?', 'John F. Morici', ""I'll start with that, Jon, in terms of the current guidance. Look, we're looking at the environment that we're all in. It's not a great economy, most places, but it is more stable, and we're building off of that. And then as Joe said, we're doing things to play offense. New products that we have with Lumina and IPE and so on, which we think, can help us grow in this environment."", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Jon, your question about the ramp up, the margin piece or part of that, what's that mean in 2025 or whatever. Look, we feel confident, and as you know from our discussions and our analyst presentation last year is 3D printing is foundationally, it can be less expensive as we scale. And so I mean, we'll start to see that come through as we scale that. But we need time to scale this. No one's ever had this polymer before that has a scale. No one's ever used the Cubicure system to the degree that we need to use it. Now we did this with 3D systems years ago because we basically scaled those systems through our team and team knows how to do that. I just can't tell you specifically within those in the next 1 to 3 years, with this being the first year, exactly when that really hits that hyperbolic side."", 'John F. Morici', ""And just to close on the CapEx, those prior years, that was -- a lot of that was -- it was equipment. Of course, we are always adding capacity, but a lot of that was very much unique for buildings, adding buildings for our locations, manufacturing and so on. And when we add some of the capacity that we're adding for our manufacturing, it will go in existing buildings. So we don't have to add another building in most cases for this. So that's why the CapEx is where it is."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.', 'Brandon Vazquez', ""On the guidance, maybe one other way I wanted to ask you and see if I could tease out a little bit of color on what's assumed here. If I kind of go back to some old sequentials in the teen side, assuming that's a little less susceptible to macro headwinds, you can probably kind of get to a low single-digit volume growth, I think, for the entire Clear Aligner business already, but probably not even including some DSP. So is that -- am I thinking about this correctly that really out of adults on a year-over-year basis for full year '24, you're really assuming kind of flattish, maybe even down depending on how teens and some of the DSP cases are doing?"", 'John F. Morici', ""I would characterize it, Brandon, this is John, that both teen and adult are positive on a year-over-year basis, expect maybe adults to grow faster as we've seen compared to -- teens grow faster than adults as we've seen in the past, but I would expect both of them to be up and show our numbers that way."", 'Brandon Vazquez', ""Okay. And then can you just reiterate maybe both for IPE and for Lumina exciting. It seems like they're going to ramp over the coming quarters. Are there any like key quarters and catalysts that we should think about that might take that up. You're talking about a ramp, but we get to the next level on the ramp on any of those when they go from maybe a limited launch to full market relief, anything like that?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Brandon, Joe again. On the Lumina side, remember, our restorative scanner for GPs comes out in the third quarter. But as like John indicated, we indicated, we feel we can sell that into the market now with the capabilities it has, but that will ramp in -- that will probably be more hinged to the regulatory approvals we have to get around the world. Right now, as I mentioned, we only have the United States and Canada and ANZ. Secondly, on IPE, it's the same thing is we're regulatory constrained. We still have to go through Europe. And as I mentioned, IPE will come out in the second quarter in Australia and also. And as we gave that, obviously, we'll be scaling IPE too and understanding the dynamics around that. So it's more of a ramp, as I mentioned a few calls ago than anything."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler.', 'Jason M. Bednar', ""I'm going to pile on here on the guidance, just to focus there first. You mentioned noncomprehensive mix as being an offsetting factor to ASPs. I know you've got that DSP factor. I had thought maybe originally you were signaling adults growing better than teens, but doesn't seem like that's the case just given your comments there to Brandon. But I guess, regardless on adults, are you seeing this market getting its footing back, it sounds like it, but if you are, what's giving you the confidence? Or what are you seeing that kind of the day-to-day or month-to-month that's showing adults are coming back into the office for treatment. And then sorry to load a few in here, but should we expect this faster noncomprehensive mix also to have gross margin benefits for the year as well? I think it typically does, but I don't think we've gotten kind of a gross margin cadence outlook for '24."", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Jason, I'll take the first part of your question and hand the rest off to John, is we feel we're on a more stable, I'd call it, economic platform than last year. And so the adult and teen question that you had is we expect that to carry through in 2024, as we indicated with our guidance, too. So when I look back, everybody has a clear vision backwards than forward, we look back to last year, a pretty unstable platform that we experienced for the year and the third quarter was a tough one in that sense. But I think we all see it right now, we have more confidence that at least we're dealing with stability from an economic standpoint in most parts of the world from what we see."", 'John F. Morici', ""And on the noncomprehensive and gross margin questions and related to that. Look, as we have the mix that shifts through and you might have an ASP lower on some of the non-comp DSP and others that fall into that. Those are our highest gross margin products from a rate standpoint. So they're helpful for us as a business. It's really what that customer wants for him or her to run their practice and that's how we balance things out. But overall, we expect that we would see benefits in gross margin just like we're talking about op margin year-over-year benefits, we should see a benefit as well in gross margin."", 'Jason M. Bednar', ""All right. That's helpful. And then for the follow-up here, I'll ask on teens. It does look like you're back to gaining share against brackets and wires. It looks like the kind of the second consecutive quarter of that. I'm curious if you could talk maybe bigger picture, what's changed to what you think has changed over the last 3 to 6 months versus maybe the 12-plus months that preceded that. But do you think the share gains you're seeing versus brackets and wires, does that have to do with changes you made to that Teen Guarantee program middle part of last year? Or are there other items at the practice level or associated with your go-to-market activities that are driving that shift?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""You can always say that at Align, there's no single variable equations. And this is another one. The Teen Guarantee, we think is some of it, obviously, our portfolio and how we put that together, our DSP programs, the uniqueness of Invisalign First. All those things really help. And from an adult standpoint, with the firmer economic platform I talked about, I just think there's more confidence out there that we're starting to see lead through."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.', 'Michael Leonidovich Ryskin', ""I want to start with DSP kind of where you left off really successful, obviously, and you had great growth year-over-year for the whole year. But it's kind of moved in sort of like a step function. If I just look at the numbers, 6,000, 7,000, 9,000 and then you're kind of like an 11,000, 12,000 range. Now you're in the 18,000, 19,000, 20,000 range. Is there another step function coming next year? Is there -- could you dig into a little bit into what's driving that? And just sort of where do you see that going over the next couple of years?"", 'John F. Morici', ""Michael, this is John. I would say as we look to expand this out, it's been successful, every place that we've done, we've seen, as you said, North America starts with this. So you see some doctors start and then we have more and more doctors that sign up for the program. And then as the doctors sign up for the program, then they end up doing more and more volume with us. We've taken that same approach to other countries, and now we've introduced this in EMEA and other places. And the same thing happens. More and more doctors sign up for it. They start to see the benefits of it, and then they utilize it more. So it's really just a matter of now scaling this to other parts of the world because we find that this is really a nice way to supplement how a doctor wants to run their practice."", 'Michael Leonidovich Ryskin', ""Okay. And then maybe a follow-up on a few questions that were asked on Cubicure and Direct 3D printing earlier. Really exciting technology that you unveiled late last year, and definitely see the opportunity. But could you help walk us through the road map a little bit sort of like what should we be looking for as sort of goal post 6 months out, a year out, 2 years out, just to sort of track progress and see how it -- see how it's progressing?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Michael, it's Joe again. I think the best way to describe it to you, it's -- like I said in my script, it's a 1- to 3-year journey. And obviously, we'll -- we know how to make these aligners now. We understand how to do it. It's just a scalability of resin in the Cubicure process and that takes time. And we'll obviously report on it quarter by quarter. So you really understand where we're going and what the hurdles are and what the opportunities are."", 'Michael Leonidovich Ryskin', ""Okay. Maybe if I could just tweak that a little bit. Is there -- just help us understand, is there anything in terms of -- when you talk about scalability of the resin and the polymer, if you're looking at comprehensive, noncomprehensive, you talked about retainers and being able to put those. Is there anything in terms of your portfolio that makes some products more amenable or would be amenable earlier than others? Or is this just going to be all or nothing?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""I mean obviously, the scale, you look at retainers first because units of one. And that's why you'd end up with comprehensive full cases in some way. And that's basically how we'll ramp."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.', 'Nathan Allen Rich', ""I wanted to ask on the Systems and Services revenue guidance for 2024. This looks low to me just given -- I think growth in '23 was basically flat, up slightly. With the Lumina launch, we thought it would maybe be up more than it was in 2023. So I don't know if you could just maybe elaborate on what you're expecting for that segment?"", 'John F. Morici', ""Nate, this is John. We're looking at, like we said, this year, you're kind of in that mid-single digits. We do have Lumina, which helps, but there's also unknowns about the macro economy. We were very pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter with doctors buying and actually doing better than what we had really guided to. So we're pleased with the performance of Q4, but we just want to make sure that as we ramp up Lumina that we're properly positioned there, and we'll update as we go along."", 'Nathan Allen Rich', 'Okay. Great. And then just going back to the margin cadence, I guess are there any either upfront or onetime costs associated with either the launches of Lumina or IPE that impact the margin in the early part of the year just as we think about cadence and sort of what the right baseline is.', 'John F. Morici', ""There is some of that in Q1. We're ramping that up. So it's not a big, huge splash where there's a lot of expenses and kind of hits all in 1 quarter. But there is some ramp up, but that's factored into our guidance. So when we say that we expect the year-over-year in the first quarter to be slightly up, it's factored in -- those expenses are factored in."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ann Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""You mentioned at the end of the call, some of the DTC customers that you are tailoring some of the offerings to. I guess, was this material at all in the quarter? Maybe it's not large enough at this point, but any sort of contributions in 2024 as we think about picking up some of that business? And then also, DSO relationships, has there been any changes there in terms of the relationships on that front? How would you characterize those at this point? Are you seeing any greater traction there? Do some of these new products really move the needle on some of those relationships or conversations you're having?"", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Ann, on the DTC customers, we've always argued that, that wasn't our marketplace in the sense of the price point and all. But I mean, obviously, these patients will pursue treatment. Now probably more so for doctors than DTC. And we're just doing what we can in order to support those customers going forward. But again, as I was clear in my script, we're a doctor-focused client company, and we'll keep it that way. But we do see this as being a certain opportunity. It's just hard for us to quantify right now.On the DSO relationships, I'd say this has gotten stronger all around the globe. Two to call out would be Heartland and (inaudible) being more new ortho side and Heartland being more on the GP side. But we have really good relationships and we leverage our portfolio well with them to help them grow and we grow with them. So I feel good about our position with DSOs, and we have good strong relationships out there with them."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.', 'Brandon Couillard', ""Joe, given the positive macro shift we've seen in the last few months with consumer confidence coming back, any chance you can comment on what you've seen in case starts in January an inflection? And then with respect to the '24 growth outlook. Any chance you could break that out between Americas and International."", 'Joseph M. Hogan', ""Yes. I can't -- I really wouldn't break it out between Americas and International because we felt good about the geographies in general as you went across the world for especially latter half of the fourth quarter of last year. As we go into this year, as I talk about, we're looking at, I think, a stable economic platform. Some of the data that you cited would support that overall. And we feel good about our new products. We think we can play offense. And that's what we're focused on right now."", 'Brandon Couillard', 'Okay. And then one housekeeping one for you, John. The fourth quarter operating cash flow was pretty weak. Can you just unpack any of the moving parts that might have been onetime in the quarter. It looks like there was a spike in prepaid expenses on the balance sheet. But anything you would call out?', 'John F. Morici', ""Things that related to like tax payments and things. It's just some timing as things go through the year. But we feel great. I mean, it's a great model. It generates a lot of cash. It gives us a lot of flexibility, and we were able to use that cash, that $350 million buyback that we did last quarter."", 'Operator', 'And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Shirley Stacy for closing remarks.', 'Shirley Stacy', 'Thank you, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at upcoming financial conferences and at industry meetings such as Chicago Midwinter.

John will provide more detail on our Q4 financial performance and comment on our views for 2024."", ""Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. I'm pleased to report fourth-quarter results with better-than-expected revenues and earnings. As of the end of Q4, we achieved several major milestones, including 17 million Invisalign patients treated, including 4.7 million teens, plus 4 million Vivera Retainer cases and over 100,000 iTero scanners sold. And for the full year -- fiscal year 2023, total revenues exceeded our prior outlook, and we delivered fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating margin above 21%."", 'For Q4, total revenues were up 6.1% year over year, reflecting increased Systems and Services revenues. Strength in Clear Aligner volumes for teens and international doctors as well as continued growth from Invisalign touch-up cases, under our Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP. Our Q4 Systems and Services revenues were up year over year primarily due to increased services, CAD/CAM and nonsystems revenues, including scanner leasing and rental programs and certified preowned scanner sales. Q4 total Clear Aligner shipments were slightly lower year over year.', ""On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner volumes were down for the Americas and EMEA regions and were up for the APAC region. For Q4, Clear Aligner shipments include approximately 20,000 Invisalign DSP touch-up cases, primarily in North America, an increase of more than 60% year over year from Q4 '22. DSP continues to be well received by our customers and is currently available in the U.S. and Canada, Iberia, and Nordics and most recently, the U.K."", ""We're excited that DSP is proving helpful to doctors and their patients as we continue to expand the program. For fiscal 2023, total Invisalign DSP touch-up cases shipped were 73,000, up 85% year over year. For non-case revenues, Q4 was up 13.3% year over year primarily due to continued growth from Vivera Retainers along with Invisalign DSP retainer revenues. On a sequential basis, Q4 total revenues were down slightly, 0.4%, primarily reflecting anticipated seasonally lower teens case starts, especially in the U.S."", 'ortho channel and unfavorable foreign exchange offset somewhat by increased revenues from System and Services as well as an increase in Clear Aligner volume for adults and noncomprehensive cases and stronger volumes from Canada and the EMEA region. Q4 total Aligner shipments were slightly lower sequentially. On a sequential basis, Clear Aligner volumes were down for the Americas and APAC regions and were up sequentially for the EMEA region. The December gauge practice analysis tool that collects and consolidates data from approximately 1,000 orthodontic practices across the U.S.', 'and Canada reported year-over-year decline for new patients, total exams, and total starts, particularly among teens and kids. It also shows a year-over-year decline for wires and brackets and total Clear Aligner starts with Invisalign case starts better than the Clear Aligner brand. And the teen segment for Q4, a 197,000 teens and younger patients started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligner Systems, up 6% year over year and were a record number of teen cases shipped compared to prior fourth quarters. Q4 teens starts were down sequentially, consistent with historical seasonality, primarily in China as well as seasonally fewer teen starts in North America compared to Q3.', 'For fiscal 2023, total Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and younger patients reached a total of 809,000 cases, up 8% compared to the prior year and made up 34% of total Clear Aligner shipments. During Q4, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the Invisalign Palatal Expander System, we call it IPE, Invisalign Palatal Expander for commercial availability in the United States. The FDA 510(k) clearance is for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens, and adults.', 'Full early intervention treatments such as Phase I or early interceptive treatment, makes up about 20% of the orthodontic case starts each year and is growing. Together with Invisalign First Aligners, IPEs provide doctors with a solution set to treat the most common skeletal, dental malocclusions in growing children. The addition of mandibular advancement features to Invisalign aligners also provides doctors with more options for treating skeletal, dental joint balances and bite correction and for their growing patients during their teenage years. Essentially, we now have an Invisalign digital treatment solution for every phase of treatment.', ""IPE is currently available on a limited basis in Canada and the United States, and we recently received regulatory clearance in Australia and New Zealand where we anticipate commercialization in Q2. We expect IPE to be available in other markets pending future applicable regulatory approvals. We're also launching ClinCheck smile video, the next generation of in-face visualization with AI-assisted video that is expected to be available to all doctors who use the Invisalign Practice App and ClinCheck treatment planning software. This new tool is designed to help improve patients' understanding and the confidence in Invisalign treatment and is based on iTero Intraoral Scanner and doctors ClinCheck plan for Invisalign treatment."", ""ClinCheck smile video simulates the doctor's ClinCheck treatment plan with a short video of a patient's face, and they talk and smile, which helps patients visualize their potential new smile and can lead to a higher patient treatment acceptance. We expect to roll out ClinCheck smile video in Q1 '24 in North America and EMEA, followed by APAC later in the year. Before I turn the call over to John for our fourth quarter financial review, I want to share one more exciting news. Today, we introduced the latest innovation in the iTero family of intraoral scanners."", 'The iTero Lumina intraoral scanner is designed to meet the needs of doctors and their patients by offering smaller wand with unparalleled data capture capabilities for effortlessly scanning by clinical members. The iTero Lumina Intraoral scanner is a breakthrough technology. With 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller wand that delivers faster scanning, higher accuracy, and superior visualization for greater practice efficiency. iTero Lumina quickly, easily, and accurately captures more data while delivering exceptionally scanned quality and photorealistic images that eliminate the need for intraoral photos altogether.', 'Doctors can now scan at twice the speed with a wide field of capture, multi-angled scanning, and large capture distance, meaning they can capture more dentition in greater detail throughout the scanning process. To date, Align has filed over 30 patent applications covering technology related to the iTero Lumina intraoral scanner. I believe iTero Lumina has the potential to set a new standard of care for dental practices by simplifying the scanning of complex oral regions while offering superior chairside visualization and more comfortable experience for patients, especially kids. Initial doctor feedback has been very positive, noting that iTero Lumina scanner is much faster, clear, less invasive for their patients and the imaging and visualization translates to better communications and patient experience.', ""The iTero Lumina intraoral scanner is available now with orthodontic workflows and will be available in the second half of 2024 restorative workflows, although we expect that GP practices can benefit now from the new scanning technology. A global broadcast to unveil iTero Lumina and provide attendees with insights and detailed information from our iTero team and early customer users is planned for February 15. Registration will open on February 1 and the link has been provided in our financial slides as well as in today's press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to John."", 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Joe. Now, for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $956.7 million, down 0.4% from the prior quarter and up 6.1% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q4 '23 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $12.8 million or approximately 1.3% sequentially and were favorably impacted by approximately $13.8 million year over year or approximately 1.5%."", 'For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of $781.9 million were down 1.6% sequentially, primarily from lower volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were up 6.9% and primarily due to higher ASPs and non-case revenues slightly offset by lower volumes. For Q4, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and up year over year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, higher sales credits and higher discounts.', 'On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, price increases and favorable impact from foreign exchange partially offset by higher discounts in product mix to lower ASP products. For Q4, ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year over year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflect the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher net revenue deferrals, partially offset by price increases and lower discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in ASPs reflect price increases, the impact from favorable foreign exchange and higher additional aligners, partially offset by a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher discounts.', ""Last quarter, we announced about a 5% global price increase for some Invisalign products across most markets effective January 1, 2024. Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product is available in North America and certain markets in EMEA and APAC, most recently launching in China, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product and anticipate it will continue to increase, providing doctors the flexibility they want and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product. Q4 '23 Clear Aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $10.7 million or approximately 1.4% sequentially."", ""On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $12 million or approximately 1.6%. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $14.9 million or 1.2% sequentially and $74.6 million or up 6.1% year over year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q4 '23 Systems and Services revenues of $174.8 million were up 5.8% sequentially primarily due to higher ASPs and an increase in CAD/CAM and services revenue, partially offset by lower volumes and were up 2.9% year over year primarily due to higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and increased nonsystem revenues related to our CPO and leasing rental programs mostly offset by lower ASPs and scanner volume. CAD/CAM and services revenues for Q4 represent approximately 50% of our Systems and Services business."", ""Q4 '23 Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.1 million or approximately 1.2% sequential. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenue were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.9 million or approximately 1.1%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet were down $4.3 million or 1.6% sequentially and down $13.1 million or 4.8% year over year primarily due to the recognition of services revenue which is recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins and purchase certified preowned scanners in certain markets."", 'Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 70%, up 0.9 points sequentially and up 1.5 points year over year. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 70.5% up 0.9 points sequentially and up 1.2 points year over year.', 'Overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.4 points sequentially and favorably impacted by approximately 0.4 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.1% up 0.4 points sequentially primarily due to lower manufacturing spend, partially offset by higher freight costs. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 0.3 points year over year primarily due to higher ASPs and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher manufacturing spend and freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.8%, up 3.8 points sequentially due to higher ASPs, partially offset by higher service and freight costs.', ""Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was up six points year over year due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower ASPs. Before I go into the details, I want to note that during Q4 '23, we incurred a total of $14 million of restructuring and other charges, primarily related to post-employment benefits. Q4 operating expenses were $498 million, roughly flat sequentially and down 1.4 points year over year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly due -- primarily due to restructuring and other charges, offset by lower employee compensation."", 'Year-over-year operating expenses decreased by $7.1 million primarily due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs, partially offset by employee-related costs and slightly higher restructuring charges. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $446.7 million, down 2.5% sequentially and down 2.8% year over year. Our fourth-quarter operating income of $171.5 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.9%, up 0.6 points sequentially and up 5.4 points year over year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.6 points sequentially primarily due to foreign exchange.', 'The year-over-year increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage and proactively managing our costs as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.6 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, the amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisition, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 23.8%, up two points sequentially and up 5.5 points year over year. Interest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was an income of $1.3 million compared to a loss of $4.2 million in the third quarter and income of $2.7 million in Q4 2022, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.3%, higher than the third quarter effective tax rate of 25.1% and lower than the fourth quarter effective tax rate of 63.8% in the prior year.', 'The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to one-time benefit related to tax guidance issued in Q3, partially offset by lower U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in Q4. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology.', 'Fourth-quarter net income per share was $1.64, up sequentially $0.06 and up $1.10 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.07 on a sequential basis and favorably impacted by $0.08 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.42 for the fourth quarter, up $0.28 sequentially and up $0.69 year over year. Moving on to the balance sheet.', 'As of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term marketable securities were $980.8 million, down sequentially $321.2 million and down $60.8 million year over year. Of our $980.8 million balance, $196.1 million was held in the U.S. and $784.7 million was held by our international entities. In October 2023, we purchased approximately 1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $190.56 per share through a $250 million Accelerated Share Repurchase.', ""And in November and December 2023, we purchased approximately 466,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $214.81 per share through a $100 million open market purchase, both under Align's current $1 billion stock repurchase program. We have $650 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock under this stock repurchase program. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $903.4 million, slightly down sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, flat sequentially and year over year."", 'Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $46.9 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $33.4 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $13.5 million. Now, turning to our outlook.', 'Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, we provide the following framework for Q1 and fiscal 2024. For Q1 2024, we expect our worldwide revenues to be in the range of $960 million to $980 million, up slightly from Q4 of 2023. We expect Clear Aligner volume and ASPs to be up slightly sequentially. We expect Systems and Services revenue to be down slightly sequentially, although less than the historical seasonal decline, given the launch of the iTero Lumina for ortho workflows in Q1 2024.', 'We expect our Q1 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above Q1 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. For full year, we expect fiscal 2024 total revenues to be up mid-single digits over 2023. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner and Systems and Services revenues to grow year over year in the same approximate range as our 2024 total revenues. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner ASPs to be up slightly year over year primarily due to price increases and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a higher mix of noncomprehensive products, which have lower ASPs.', 'We expect fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above the 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. We expect our investments in capital expenditures for the fiscal 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued expansion. In summary, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results, and I am especially proud of our continued focused execution of our product road map and innovation pipeline.', ""We are committed to delivering on our strategic growth drivers of international expansion, patient demand, orthodontist utilization and GP dentist treatment to extend our leadership in digital orthodontics and dentistry. I believe that the next wave of innovation that we are introducing into the market will further differentiate Align and allow us to continue to increase our share of the large untapped market opportunity of 22 million annual orthodontic case starts as well as an additional 600 million consumers who could benefit from a healthy, beautiful smile using Invisalign Clear Aligners. With that, I'll turn it back to Joe for final comments. Joe?"", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, John. In closing, while I'm pleased with our better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and start to the year, I'm even more excited about Align innovation in 2024 and our next wave of growth drivers. When I spoke to you about a year ago, I discussed the innovations that we are planning to bring to market that we continue to revolutionize the orthodontic and dental industry and scanning software and direct 3D printing. We are delivering on that promise."", ""With the introduction of iTero Lumina powered by Multi-Direct Capture technology, we are pushing the boundaries of what intraoral scanners can do. iTero Lumina is a combination of years of research and development to offer visualization capabilities that support doctors, clinical decisions while also enhancing their patients' comfort and overall treatment experiences. Building on more than 20 years of expertise in revolutionizing imaging technologies, the iTero Lumina scanner elevates the standard in digital scanning to achieve exceptional clinical outcomes and increased practice efficiency. The iTero scanner is at the forefront of digital dentistry."", 'With the closing of our acquisition of Cubicure, a pioneer of direct 3D printing solutions for polymer additive manufacturing, we will enable the next generation of 3D printed products, helping to create more unique configurations for aligners that are more sustainable and also efficient solutions. We also expect it to extend and scale our printing materials and manufacturing capabilities for our 3D printed product portfolio, which now includes the Invisalign Palate Expander System. And with the introduction of IPE, we have expanded the clinical applicability of the Invisalign system to nearly 100% of the orthodontic case starts. The ability to direct 3D print, IPE will eventually lead to other direct printed products with the goal of direct 3D printed Invisalign Clear Aligners, which we hope to achieve in the next couple of years.', 'As a company, Align has multifaceted competitive advantage, technology innovation, where we invest up to $300 million in R&D per year to bring in some of the most disruptive products in digital dentistry and orthodontics to the market in a highly regulated industry. A direct sales force that consists of 5,000 highly trained specialists, a doctor-centered model because we understand the importance of doctor-directed care, a $1 billion brand trusted by over 17 million patients worldwide and global scale and manufacturing to deliver millions of customized Clear Aligner parts every day. We are extremely pleased with our latest innovations and commercialization of products to better serve our doctors, customers, and their patients. Our belief in the future business overall is unwavering.', ""Before we turn the call over to the operator, I want to address an important matter regarding DTC or direct-to-consumer Clear Aligners in our industry. Align has always believed that a doctor-centered model for orthodontic treatment is the safest for patients, and we're always looking for new and better ways to support doctors as they work to create better smiles for their patients. Recent news regarding the bankruptcy of a DTC clear aligner company has led many consumers to reach out to Invisalign providers to address their unmet needs, including helping those DTC patients with incomplete treatments. To support these former DTC patients who are seeking help from Invisalign providers and practices, in Q4 we introduced a program in the U.S."", ""and select other markets, offering up to a 50% off Invisalign case submission in Vivera Retention to help offset any additional cost to finish their treatment. We want to help everyone achieve a healthy beautiful smile and strongly recommend that individuals who are impacted by this matter seek the advice of a licensed orthodontist or dentist. Our concierge team is always available to answer questions and help connect consumers with Invisalign practices. With that, I'll thank you for your time today."", ""We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?"", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.', 'Elizabeth Anderson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could walk us through the components of the mid-single-digit guide.', ""I got -- for 2024. I understand what you said that like Systems and Services and Clear Aligners would be in the same range. I guess I'm just sort of thinking about like how to think about that. It seems like maybe it's like low single-digit ASP improvement and then sort of low to mid-single-digit case growth."", 'Is that the right way to think about it? Like what else can you -- is there anything else you can sort of clarify on that? And sort of how do you expect, at least currently, the sort of pacing of the year to progress?', 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Elizabeth, this is John. You haven't framed it the right way. We're looking at the segments up mid-single digits and then ASPs because of the price increase."", 'We have some offset due to some of the lower-stage products that we have, including the DSP touch-ups and so on, that you would expect then a little bit lower of ASP impact year over year.', 'Elizabeth Anderson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Got it. That makes sense. And then separately, how has the volume in sort of market in China been progressing across the fourth quarter and maybe into the first quarter so far as you can comment?', 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Elizabeth, it's Joe. We felt good about China last year. But remember, we had year-over-year comparisons that were really favorable because of the COVID shutdowns over there last year. But overall, as we exited the year, we felt good about our performance there, and we feel good about as we move into 2024 about our competitive position there in -- a China market that I think is a little more predictable because it's not the overhead that we've seen with COVID over the last, really, several years."", 'Elizabeth Anderson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Got it. And sorry, maybe one last one for me. Can you just remind us the sort of 1Q dip in the operating margins and then how it sort of steps up across the year? I understand the guidance you gave for the first quarter of the year, but just why that first quarter has a sort of different perspective than the rest of the year. Thanks.', 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, we wanted to give to prior year because, in that prior year, when you start the year, you have certain expenses that you incur right at the beginning, payroll, taxes, and other things that you incur initially some of the investments that you make that you then get leverage on as you go through the year. So, it's similar to how we position things from last year in 2023."", 'Elizabeth Anderson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. You may proceed.', 'Jeff Johnson -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, can you hear me OK?', 'Shirley Stacy', 'Yes. We hear you fine.', 'Jeff Johnson -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', ""All right. Great. John, maybe I want to -- I'll follow up on Elizabeth's margin question there beyond just the 1Q. Let's say, you hit your guidance this year on operating margin is up nominally from 2023 level."", ""It'd be three years in a row kind of in that low to mid-21% range. I think pre-COVID you were up in the 25% range or so. What's it going to take to get those margins moving back toward those pre COVID. You've taken price increases two years in a row."", ""It feels like your R&D should be coming down a little bit. Obviously, with Cubicure and that, I know you're continuing to invest aggressively, but IPE is out, Lumina now out, things like that. So, just help us understand when could we start to see a path back toward getting those margins maybe up a few points from where they've settled in the last few years?"", 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Jeff, this is John. Really, when you start to get some of that volume leverage, we're positioned as having our manufacturing and the organization that we have that's really set to drive more growth. And once we get some of that volume leverage, we should see that benefit showing up in our numbers."", ""And it's really what we saw as we went through the quarters last year where you see some of that volume benefit. You get that benefit as well when you go through the year, but really looking to try to drive as much volume as we can and you'll start to see some of that leverage that shows up in our numbers."", 'Jeff Johnson -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', ""All right. Fair enough. And then, Joe, you know, I think we've talked for many years now how iTero is carved out such a commanding, strong competitive position. You've sold a ton of iTeros over the last five, six years or so."", ""They're all probably getting, I don't know, close to their end of their useful life or so. Lumina for the first time feels like that kind of product with a better form factor, especially things like that that could really cause some of these docs to say, I got to get rid of this big iTero and go back down to this much smaller one, and things like that, just things that would actually matter to the docs, and I'm sure the technology does this, too, I don't want to just put it on the size. But just thinking there, is this the kind of product that can finally kick off that multiyear upgrade strategy or path in iTero that we've kind of been waiting to see?"", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""You know, Jeff, the easy answer and the quick answer is yes. I mean, it's just a brand-new platform. Now, we set up -- I mentioned in my script about we have 100,000 units out there that we've sold so far. About a third of those are 5D pluses, which are upgradable by just wand switch out."", ""This is the way we've designed Lumina. And so, that part's easy. Also, we've been really aggressively upgrading our installed base between E1 and E2 out there, too, to better position it for this kind of a move. So, as we develop Lumina, we had exactly in mind what you just questioned, and we think we're in a good position to do that."", 'Jeff Johnson -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', ""And if you switch out that wand from the five to the Lumina, there is a fee there, right? It's not like, hey, you bought this knowing that you could always upgrade at no charge to Lumina."", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""There's no charity here at Align. There will be a charge."", 'Jeff Johnson -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'I like to hear that. God bless capitalism. Thanks, Joe.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. You may proceed.', 'Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, Joe, maybe this one's for you. Video 1Q '24 IPE some markets today, but more in the common IPE should have longer term with team, docs might take a little bit of a wait-and-see approach."", ""You talked about the new scanner. In your opinion, like is innovation are we seeing that in the '24 guide? Or is that more of like a ramp in the '25? And maybe even to take that a step further, John, for you, is there a way to sort of quantify out of that mid-single-digit revenue growth, what can you attribute to these new products coming on board in '24? I'm just trying to think about the impact of '24, is this more the ramp or the slope in the '25 for the innovation hitting?"", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Jon, I like the way you set that up. It's a ramp, it really is. But we feel good that we can play offense with these product lines. Now, we still have to scale IPE."", ""We have a great team that knows how to scale, and we'll get through that. Obviously, Lumina is a completely different set outside of the computer itself. The wand itself is we feel good about the scale part of that as we sell through the marketplace. But overall, I think the way you described it is a ramp of this new technology really beginning in 2024 is a good foundation for that kind of thought process."", 'Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""And any way to quantify what's in there from the current guide or no? Is that just too difficult to tease out?"", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'It really is just too --', 'Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', 'OK. OK. So, second one is maybe a multipart. But just first on the capex, $100 million.', 'I mean, I was really surprised on how low that number was for this year. It\'s $400 million in \'21, $300 million in \'22 million, and I was maybe even more surprised when I think about the direct fabrication initiatives. So, I know the slides say hoping to print Invisalign Clear Aligner ""next couple of years."" Do we still think retainers 2H \'24, 1H \'25? When do we feel like you proved it out, so to say? And do we start to see gross margin benefits from this as early as next year, turning accretive in 2025? And then admittedly just a jump to another question. For the guidance, can you just help us what\'s embedded in there? And I bring that up because we\'ve seen this big move in U.S.', 'consumer confidence. Europe still seems very choppy. So, when we tie back to your guidance for the year, what are you extrapolating out, if you would, for the current macro? Thanks, guys.', 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""You know, I'll start with that, Jon, in terms of the current guidance. Look, we're looking at the environment that we're all in. It's not a great economy, most places, but it is more stable, and we're building off of that. And then as Joe said, we're doing things to play offense."", 'New products that we have with Lumina and IPE and so on, which we think, can help us grow in this environment.', 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Jon, your question about the ramp-up, the margin piece or part of that, what's that mean in 2025 or whatever? Look, we feel confident, and as you know from our discussions and our analyst presentation last year is 3D printing is -- foundationally, it can be less expensive as we scale. And so, I mean, we'll start to see that come through as we scale that. But we need time to scale this. No one's ever had this polymer before that has a scale."", ""No one's ever used the Cubicure system to the degree that we need to use it. Now, we did this with 3D systems years ago because we basically scaled those systems through our team and team knows how to do that. I just can't tell you specifically within those in the next one to three years, with this being the first year, exactly when that really hits that hyperbolic side."", 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""And just to close on the capex, those prior years, that was -- a lot of that was -- it was equipment. Of course, we are always adding capacity, but a lot of that was very much unique for buildings, adding buildings for our locations, manufacturing and so on. And when we add some of the capacity that we're adding for our manufacturing, it will go in existing buildings. So, we don't have to add another building in most cases for this."", ""So, that's why the capex is where it is."", 'Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', 'All good. Thanks for the color, guys.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. You may proceed.', 'Brandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', ""Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. On the guidance, maybe one other way I wanted to ask you and see if I could tease out a little bit of color on what's assumed here. If I kind of go back to some old sequentials in the teen side, assuming that's a little less susceptible to macro headwinds, you can probably kind of get to a low single-digit volume growth, I think, for the entire Clear Aligner business already, but probably not even including some DSP."", ""So, is that -- am I thinking about this correctly that really out of adults on a year-over-year basis for full year '24, you're really assuming kind of flattish, maybe even down depending on how teens and some of the DSP cases are doing?"", 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I would characterize it, Brandon, this is John, that both teen and adult are positive on a year-over-year basis, expect maybe adults to grow faster as we've seen compared to -- teens grow faster than adults as we've seen in the past, but I would expect both of them to be up and show our numbers that way."", 'Brandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. And then can you just reiterate maybe both for IPE and for Lumina? Exciting. It seems like they're going to ramp over the coming quarters. Are there any like key quarters and catalysts that we should think about that might take that up? You're talking about a ramp, but we get to the next level on the ramp on any of those when they go from maybe a limited launch to full market relief, anything like that? Thanks."", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, Brandon, Joe again. On the Lumina side, remember, our restorative scanner for GPs comes out in the third quarter. But as like John indicated, we indicated, we feel we can sell that into the market now with the capabilities it has, but that will ramp in -- that will probably be more hinged to the regulatory approvals we have to get around the world. Right now, as I mentioned, we only have the United States and Canada and ANZ.', ""Secondly, on IPE, it's the same thing is we're regulatory constrained. We still have to go through Europe. And as I mentioned, IPE will come out in the second quarter in Australia and also. And as we gave that, obviously, we'll be scaling IPE too and understanding the dynamics around that."", ""So, it's more of a ramp, as I mentioned a few calls ago than anything."", 'Brandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks, everyone.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.', 'Jason Bednar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""Hey there. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm going to pile on here on the guidance, just to focus there first. You mentioned noncomprehensive mix as being an offsetting factor to ASPs."", ""I know you've got that DSP factor. I had thought maybe originally you were signaling adults growing better than teens but doesn't seem like that's the case just given your comments there to Brandon. But I guess regardless on adults, are you seeing this market getting its footing back, it sounds like it, but if you are, what's giving you the confidence? Or what are you seeing that kind of the day-to-day or month-to-month that's showing adults are coming back into the office for treatment? And then sorry to load a few in here, but should we expect this faster noncomprehensive mix also to have gross margin benefits for the year as well? I think it typically does, but I don't think we've gotten kind of a gross margin cadence outlook for '24."", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Jason, I'll take the first part of your question and hand the rest off to John. We feel we're on a more stable, I'd call it, economic platform than last year. And so, the adult and teen question that you had is we expect that to carry through in 2024, as we indicated with our guidance, too. So, when I look back, everybody has a clear vision backwards than forward, we look back to last year, a pretty unstable platform that we experienced for the year and the third quarter was a tough one in that sense."", ""But I think we all see it right now. We have more confidence that at least we're dealing with stability from an economic standpoint in most parts of the world from what we see."", 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""And on the noncomprehensive and gross margin questions and related to that, look, as we have the mix that shifts through and you might have an ASP lower on some of the non-comp DSP and others that fall into that. Those are our highest gross margin products from a rate standpoint. So, they're helpful for us as a business. It's really what that customer wants for him or her to run their practice and that's how we balance things out."", ""But overall, we expect that we would see benefits in gross margin just like we're talking about op margin year-over-year benefits, we should see a benefit as well in gross margin."", 'Jason Bednar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""All right. That's helpful. Thank you. And then for the follow-up here, I'll ask on teens."", ""It does look like you're back to gaining share against brackets and wires. It looks like the kind of the second consecutive quarter of that. I'm curious if you could talk maybe bigger picture, what's changed to what you think has changed over the last three to six months versus maybe the 12-plus months that preceded that. But do you think the share gains you're seeing versus brackets and wires, does that have to do with changes you made to that Teen Guarantee program middle part of last year? Or are there other items at the practice level or associated with your go-to-market activities that are driving that shift?"", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""You can always say that at Align, there's no single-variable equations. And this is another one. The Teen Guarantee, we think is some of it, obviously, our portfolio and how we put that together, our DSP programs, the uniqueness of Invisalign First. All those things really help."", ""And from an adult standpoint, with the firmer economic platform I talked about, I just think there's more confidence out there that we're starting to see bleed through."", 'Jason Bednar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'OK. Helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. You may proceed.', 'Michael Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I want to start with DSP kind of where you left off really successful, obviously, and you had great growth year over year for the whole year. But it's kind of moved in sort of like a step function."", ""If I just look at the numbers, 6,000, 7,000, 9,000 and then you're kind of like an 11,000, 12,000 range. Now, you're in the 18,000, 19,000, 20,000 range. Is there another step function coming next year? Is there -- could you dig into a little bit into what's driving that? And just sort of where do you see that going over the next couple of years?"", 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Michael, this is John. I would say as we look to expand this out, it's been successful, every place that we've done, we've seen, as you said, North America starts with this. So, you see some doctors start and then we have more and more doctors that sign up for the program."", ""And then as the doctors sign up for the program, they end up doing more and more volume with us. We've taken that same approach to other countries, and now we've introduced this in EMEA and other places. And the same thing happens. More and more doctors sign up for it."", ""They start to see the benefits of it, and then they utilize it more. So, it's really just a matter of now scaling this to other parts of the world because we find that this is really a nice way to supplement how a doctor wants to run their practice."", 'Michael Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""OK. And then maybe a follow-up on a few questions that were asked on Cubicure and Direct 3D printing earlier. Really exciting technology that you unveiled late last year, and definitely see the opportunity. But could you help walk us through the road map a little bit sort of like what should we be looking for as sort of goal post six months out, a year out, two years out, just to sort of track progress and see how it -- see how it's progressing?"", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Michael, it's Joe again. I think the best way to describe it to you, it's -- like I said in my script, it's a one- to three-year journey. And obviously, we'll -- we know how to make these aligners now. We understand how to do it."", ""It's just a scalability of resin in the Cubicure process and that takes time. And we'll obviously report on it quarter by quarter. So, you really understand where we're going and what the hurdles are and what the opportunities are."", 'Michael Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""OK. Maybe if I could just tweak that a little bit. Is there -- just help us understand, is there anything in terms of -- when you talk about scalability of the resin and the polymer, if you're looking at comprehensive, noncomprehensive, you talked about retainers and being able to put those. Is there anything in terms of your portfolio that makes some products more amenable or would be amenable earlier than others? Or is this just going to be all or nothing?"", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I mean, obviously, the scale, you look at retainers first because units of one. And that's why you'd end up with comprehensive full cases in some way. And that's basically how we'll ramp."", 'Michael Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'OK. Great. Thanks, guys.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.', 'Nathan Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the Systems and Services revenue guidance for 2024. This looks low to me just given -- I think growth in '23 was basically flat, up slightly."", ""With the Lumina launch, we thought it would maybe be up more than it was in 2023. So, I don't know if you could just maybe elaborate on what you're expecting for that segment."", 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Nate, this is John. We're looking at -- like we said, this year, you're kind of in that mid-single digits. We do have Lumina, which helps, but there's also unknowns about the macro economy. We were very pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter with doctors buying and actually doing better than what we had really guided to."", ""So, we're pleased with the performance of Q4, but we just want to make sure that as we ramp up Lumina that we're properly positioned there, and we'll update as we go along."", 'Nathan Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'OK. Great. And then just going back to the margin cadence, I guess are there any either upfront or one-time costs associated with either the launches of Lumina or IPE that impact the margin in the early part of the year just as we think about cadence and sort of what the right baseline is.', 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""There is some of that in Q1. We're ramping that up. So, it's not a big, huge splash where there's a lot of expenses and kind of hits all in one quarter. But there is some ramp-up, but that's factored into our guidance."", ""So, when we say that we expect the year over year in the first quarter to be slightly up, it's factored in -- those expenses are factored in."", 'Nathan Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.', 'Erin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Great. You mentioned at the end of the call, some of the DTC customers that you are tailoring some of the offerings to. I guess, was this material at all in the quarter? Maybe it's not large enough at this point, but any sort of contributions in 2024 as we think about picking up some of that business? And then also, DSO relationships, has there been any changes there in terms of the relationships on that front? How would you characterize those at this point? Are you seeing any greater traction there? Do some of these new products really move the needle on some of those relationships or conversations you're having? Thanks."", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""On the DTC customers, we've always argued that that wasn't our marketplace in the sense of the price point and all. But I mean, obviously, these patients will pursue treatment. Now, probably more so for doctors than DTC. And we're just doing what we can in order to support those customers going forward."", ""But again, as I was clear in my script, we're a doctor-focused client company, and we'll keep it that way. But we do see this as being a certain opportunity. It's just hard for us to quantify right now. On the DSO relationships, I'd say this has gotten stronger all around the globe."", 'Two to call out would be Heartland and Smile Docs, Smile Docs being more new ortho side and Heartland being more on the GP side. But we have really good relationships, and we leverage our portfolio well with them to help them grow and we grow with them. So, I feel good about our position with DSOs, and we have good strong relationships out there with them.', 'Erin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. You may proceed.', 'Brandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, given the positive macro shift we've seen in the last few months with consumer confidence coming back, any chance you can comment on what you've seen in case starts in January an inflection? And then with respect to the '24 growth outlook. Any chance you could break that out between Americas and International?"", 'Joe Hogan -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I can't -- I really wouldn't break it out between Americas and International because we felt good about the geographies in general as you went across the world for, especially, latter half of the fourth quarter of last year. As we go into this year, as I talk about, we're looking at, I think, a stable economic platform. Some of the data that you cited would support that overall."", ""And we feel good about our new products. We think we can play offense. And that's what we're focused on right now."", 'Brandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'OK. And then one housekeeping one for you, John. The fourth quarter operating cash flow was pretty weak. Can you just unpack any of the moving parts that might have been one-time in the quarter? It looks like there was a spike in prepaid expenses on the balance sheet.', 'But anything you would call out?', 'John Morici -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Things that related to like tax payments and things. It's just some timing as things go through the year. But we feel great. I mean, it's a great model."", 'It generates a lot of cash. It gives us a lot of flexibility, and we were able to use that cash, that $350 million buyback that we did last quarter.', 'Brandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Gotcha.

He managed George Soros' Quantum Fund at the time, and the pair reportedly pocketed a $1 billion profit on the transactions. Meanwhile, Druckenmiller ran his own hedge fund between 1981 and 2010, returning an average of 30% annually for clients."", 'Today, he manages his personal fortune through the Duquesne Family Office, which still makes a compelling case study. Druckenmiller had 39% of his $2.8 billion portfolio invested in just three stocks as of September: 14% in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), 13% in Coupang (NYSE: CPNG), and 12% in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). That level of asset allocation signals high conviction.', ""Here's what investors should know about those three stocks."", 'Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for data center accelerators, especially where artificial intelligence (AI) workloads are concerned. Analysts estimate the company accounts for 80% to 95% of chips used in AI computing. That positioning has been a substantial catalyst over the past year. Businesses are eager to experiment with generative AI, and Nvidia is ""best positioned"" to monetize the technology, according to KeyBanc analyst John Vinh.', 'However, what makes Nvidia truly formidable is its full-stack strategy. The company offers solutions at every layer of the AI stack: infrastructure, software, and services. In recent years, its data center hardware portfolio has expanded to include networking equipment and central processing units. The former is a $10 billion business, and the latter is ""ramping into a new multibillion-dollar product line next year,"" according to CEO Jensen Huang.', 'Additionally, Nvidia AI Enterprise is a suite of subscription software that streamlines the development of AI applications across various end markets, including manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and customer service. And DGX Cloud is a platform that brings together GPU-accelerated infrastructure, AI Enterprise software, and pre-trained machine learning models. With those tools, Nvidia democratizes AI for businesses of all sizes.', 'Argus analysts praised DGX Cloud, saying, ""Nvidia stands out, in our view, not only because it participates in so many parts of the dynamic AI economy, but because it has synthesized its offerings into a first-of-its-kind AI-as-a-service delivered through the cloud."" That affords the company an incredible competitive advantage.', 'Going forward, the market for AI hardware, software, and services is forecast to expand at 37% annually through 2030. Nvidia could theoretically achieve similar results during that period. In fact, Wall Street expects the company to grow revenue at 40% annually over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 33.9 times sales still seems a bit pricey. It may be prudent to keep this company on a watchlist for now. That said, investors set on owning shares should start with a very small position -- no more than 1% of their portfolios.', 'Coupang operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in South Korea, a region where Statista Market Insights estimates online retail sales will compound at 3% annually through 2028. To cement its leadership position, the company has introduced consumer-facing services like restaurant delivery (Coupang Eats), streaming content (Coupang Play), and fintech services (Coupang Pay). It has also added merchant-facing services for fulfillment, logistics, and advertising. Those adjacencies pull users into its ecosystem, strengthening the network effect.', 'Coupang hopes to replicate its success in Taiwan. The company launched its Rocket Delivery service in the Taiwanese market in late 2022, and it recently opened its second fulfillment center in the region. Management says its delivery service scaled quickly during its first year (more quickly than it did when it first launched in Korea). Additionally, as of the third quarter, management said Coupang was on pace to be the most downloaded app in the Taiwanese market in 2023.', 'Wall Street expects the company to increase sales by 12% annually over the next five years. There is undoubtedly risk baked into that figure, especially geopolitical tension in Taiwan and the capital requirements associated with operating a logistics network. But the stock trades at 1.1 times sales, a discount to the historical average of 2 times sales, and a reasonable price to pay for investors comfortable with the risks I just mentioned.', 'Microsoft has a prolific presence in enterprise software and cloud computing, so much so that its products and services can reasonably be described as the cornerstone of many organizations. Microsoft has twice as much software-as-a-service (SaaS) market share as its closest competitor, due in large part to strength in office productivity and enterprise resource planning software.', 'Additionally, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services behind Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, its market share has increased by four percentage points over the last three years to reach 23%, but AWS has remained flat at 32%. Microsoft could continue to gain share as investments in AI bear fruit.', 'Specifically, Azure has a partnership with OpenAI that positions Microsoft as the exclusive cloud provider to OpenAI and affords Azure customers exclusive access to the latest GPT large language models, the cognitive engines behind ChatGPT. Additionally, CEO Satya Nadella believes Azure offers the ""best AI infrastructure for both training and inference.""', 'Going forward, the enterprise SaaS and cloud computing markets are projected to compound at roughly 14% annually through 2030. That puts Microsoft on a glide path to double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade. In that context, its current valuation of 13.8 times sales is tolerable. Personally, I think other AI stocks offer more upside, but I would not fault investors for taking a small position in Microsoft today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

With more than 5 million programmers, India is emerging as one of the largest pools of AI talent for startups and global businesses — at a time when AI talent is often in short supply.

For both, the AI push could be career-defining. Pichai has termed the shift to AI as ""bigger than the internet"" and Nadella has described it as ""Microsoft\'s moment.”In a sign of India’s growing influence in AI, Ahmed Mazhari, president of Microsoft Asia, pointed to developer activity on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned platform for developers. “Today, one in four AI projects on GitHub comes from India,” Mazhari said in a statement. “By 2026, India will have eclipsed the US. India is very uniquely positioned to enable the adoption of AI at scale at home and in international markets.”Microsoft recently announced that it would train 100,000 developers in India on the latest AI technology and tools. Last year, India\'s technology industry trade body Nasscom counted nearly half a million developers specializing in AI and data sciences. “It\'s reasonable to expect a lot more top AI companies to head to India,” said Sangeeta Gupta, senior vice president of Nasscom. She said large technology services companies like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys are going full speed ahead on AI and training hundreds of thousands of engineers. “Enterprises want to adopt AI, and developers can speed up the transition,” she said.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Inside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong', 'Bloomberg New Economy Is Looking for World-Changing Leaders ', 'Is It Morning in Joe Biden’s America?', 'The Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

So you will see a shift in terms of how we promote."", ""- And going off of that more specifically what you're seeing in China because the larger the criticism, or at least what analysts have been pointing out, is the fact that you're up against competitors who are offering products that are much cheaper. So how do you then bridge that gap, because it's a very different pricing strategy than what is playing out right here in the US?"", ""RACHEL RUGGERI: Yeah. We look at that. That strategy is really around creating consumption. So getting trial and consumption. And we do believe that, over time, we will benefit from that. We continue to focus on being premium, and that means a premium experience. And we have distinct and competitive advantages to drive that including a very locally relevant coffee-forward innovation strategy with our beverages and our food. We saw some good success with that in this quarter and we'll continue that."", ""But we expect that, over time, you're going to start to see the per capita coffee consumption increase, which is a good thing and we'll benefit from that. But the market will start to mature, and we believe there will be a tiering and we're going to continue to strengthen our position in the premium market because we believe we're well positioned to lead. So that's how we're going to continue in the environment that we're in today.""]"

Sales at Chinese locations rose 10%, below Wall Street forecasts of 16% growth.', 'In addition, average ticket size in China dropped 9% year-over-year. Starbucks attributed the decline to shifting consumer patterns in China, where customers have become more value-conscious amid a weakening economy.', ""Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma breaks down the details."", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right. We're looking at Starbucks sales getting hit by slowing consumer demand and inflation. But China is leaving investors particularly worried, even with the beverage companies push into smaller cities. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma to discuss more. Hey, Brooke."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Good morning, Rachelle. Certainly, Starbucks results here didn't exactly alleviate Wall Street's concerns over its future growth plans in China. Same store sales did come in less than-- lower than expected, jumping 10% this past quarter in China, falling short of the 16% jump that Wall Street expected. And that was largely driven by a couple of key factors-- that slower sales of higher priced merchandise, in addition to a more cautious consumer that they're seeing in China."", 'Now, despite all of that, foot traffic did jump 21%, but that was largely due to a lapse in COVID-19 restrictions that happened last year. Check size, as you can see right there, dropped 9%. And this comes as local brands like Luckin Coffee and Cotti coffee are really coming in with pretty aggressive pricing strategies, particularly, low price strategies. But despite those low price competitors, Starbucks does plan to stay the course of this strategy. Starbucks CFO, Rachel Ruggeri, telling us more on that this morning.', ""RACHEL RUGGERI: We continue to focus on being premium, and that means a premium experience. And we have distinct and competitive advantages to drive that, including a very locally relevant coffee forward innovation strategy with our beverages and our food. We saw some good success with that in this quarter and we'll continue that. But we expect that over time. You're going to start to see the per capita coffee consumption increase, which is a good thing and will benefit from that."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: And on the call last night, Starbucks China CEO, Belinda Wong, made it very clear that there is a promotional environment that they're seeing in China, but they are not interested in entering a price war there. And they-- once again, they do plan to stay the course as a premium player. They do plan to grow rapidly to 9,000 stores in China by the year 2025. But, however, important to note here that they did lower their fiscal 2024 guidance, particularly for sales growth. And in China, they now expect same store sales growth to grow low single digits, and that's down from roughly 4% to 6% range that they had previously anticipated."", ""AKIKO FUJITA So Brooke, I mean, stay the course, no real promotions, and yet, you're talking about the competition from the likes of Luckin. How does Starbucks differentiate itself, or are they starting to see some of their strategy in China really take hold?"", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, Akiko. They're really doubling down saying that they believe that as time goes on, they're going to grow that coffee consumption among Chinese consumers. But they're sticking to that premium strategy, really trying to engage Chinese consumers there as they really grow and make that aggressive growth strategy there. One thing that they're doing is making a significant investment in technology. They now know, from being there in and growing rapidly in recent years, that these consumers tend to engage more on digital. We now know that digital channels accounted for a record 52% of sales there."", ""So they aim to inject-- rather invest in technology there. Other ways they plan to do it a bit untraditional-- maybe for this market-- is increasing engagement and social media, rather, traditional with influencers and partnerships. And interestingly enough, a lot of these low priced competitors, well, they aim to go to markets where they are. They say they're increasing the percentage of new stores opening in lower tier markets and new county cities. So really trying to target places they haven't been before maybe, and really trying to understand the consumer more as they continue to stay the course, look to grow there, but, they're not necessarily seeing the results that they may have expected."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: We'll continue to track that.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer staples sector, its performance, and outlook for 2024, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'In 2023, consumer staples companies experienced a decline in popularity as their revenue growth slowed down. Investors redirected their attention away from these companies and shifted towards mega-cap tech firms, which garnered greater interest and investment. The change in preference may be attributed to the perceived higher growth potential and innovation associated with the tech sector compared to the more stable but slower-growing consumer staples industry. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index found itself as the second weakest sector within the large-cap benchmark index. This particular index monitors companies within the S&P 500 classified under the GICS consumer staples sector. Throughout 2023, it experienced a decline of 2.4%, marking it as the second-worst performer, with only the utility sector exhibiting poorer results. Despite this setback, there is a more optimistic outlook for the consumer staples sector, suggesting that its future performance may not be as gloomy as indicated by its recent downturn.', 'Consumer staples companies specialize in producing or selling essential goods, such as toilet paper, bread, and toothpaste—items that people continue to purchase consistently, even in challenging economic circumstances or job loss. This consistent demand for essential products offers advantages for both consumer staples stocks and their investors. These benefits include reliable and predictable revenues, as well as resilience during economic downturns. When coupled with operational excellence, the top consumer staples stocks demonstrate a steady and gradual growth in earnings and cash flow over an extended period. Analysts are expressing optimism for the sector in 2024 due to these capabilities. Filippo Falorni, Vice President and Equity Research Analyst at Citi, shared with BNN Bloomberg his anticipation that consumer staple stocks, often regarded by investors as substitutes for bonds, will yield favorable returns throughout the current year. This expectation is rooted in the belief that these stocks will perform well amid a slowing U.S. economy. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“The consumer has been more resilient than expected … and as a result, sectors that are more offensive have performed better than staples, which tend to perform better when you have more concerns around the (macroeconomics). We’re starting to see a little bit of a slowdown in consumer spending … so I think staples, in general, can become more of a preferred sector as we head into particularly the second half of 2024.”', 'The onset of the pandemic has created new opportunities for the consumer staples sector, particularly with the surge in online shopping. The shift in consumer behavior towards digital platforms has become a notable avenue for growth within the sector. According to a recent report by Bloomberg Intelligence, digital commerce is projected to expand its share of total US retail sales significantly. Starting at 25% in 2022, the report forecasts that digital commerce will account for a third of all retail sales by the year 2027. This anticipated growth underscores the increasing prevalence and influence of online transactions in the retail landscape, highlighting a notable shift in consumer shopping habits over the coming years.', 'The digitalization of the consumer staples sector contributes to its defensive characteristics. While traditionally viewed as defensive due to the consistent demand for essential products, the integration of digital technologies adds an extra layer of resilience. The sector may not generate exceptionally high returns, but it also exhibits stability and is less prone to abrupt failures. Moreover, many of these stocks provide dividends, which can be viewed as a tangible return on investment even before substantial growth occurs. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent consumer staples stocks that pay regular dividends to shareholders. Given this, we will discuss the best consumer staples dividend stocks in this article.', 'A retail employee stocking shelves with consumer packaged goods/manufacturing products.', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we identified dividend-paying stocks from the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index with strong dividend growth track records. After that, we sorted these dividend stocks using Insider Monkey’s proprietary hedge fund sentiment data as of Q3 2023, which means that these stocks are the most popular dividend stocks among the elite hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

On January 24, the company declared a 3.4% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.22 per share.

The company provides products and related services from thousands of suppliers to over 725,000 customer locations including restaurants (~62% of sales), education and government facilities (~8%), travel and leisure establishments (~8%), healthcare facilities (~7%), and other foodservice customers (15%). Sysco possesses many business characteristics that FMI finds attractive. The company has a dominant market position in a large, growing, resilient industry. They sell necessary, consumable products. Economies of scale allow Sysco to provide a better offering than peers while also allowing them to operate with higher margins. These advantages have helped Sysco take market share over time and earn a return on capital that consistently exceeds its cost of capital. We believe that Sysco will continue to grow its market share in the large and fragmented foodservice distribution market and should be able to generate mid-single-digit EBIT growth over time. When combined with share repurchases and dividend yield, the company should generate a high-single-digit to low-double-digit total return to investors without multiple expansion.

The S&P 500 concluded the year with a substantial gain of over 24%, and the Dow ended close to its all-time high. The positive momentum was fueled by decreasing inflation, a robust economy, and the promise of lower interest rates. These factors boosted investor confidence, especially during the final two months of the year. Despite the overall strong performance of the stock market in 2023, dividend stocks didn't fare as well. In contrast to the previous year, when exchange-traded funds (ETFs) emphasizing dividend strategies attracted over $60 billion from cautious investors, 2023 saw a notable decline. Dividend-focused ETFs garnered only $1.5 billion throughout the year, marking one of the lowest collection figures on record. This lackluster outcome was primarily attributed to the fact that most of these funds didn't fully participate in the technology-driven market surge, resulting in underperformance compared to the broader S&P 500 index."", 'Despite the less-than-stellar performance of dividend stocks in the previous year, their significance for income investors remains intact.

Diana Wagner, an equity portfolio manager for Washington Mutual Investors Fund, shared insights on dividend stocks in the report and stated:', '“It is difficult to know when a cycle will turn, so investors may want to look for companies with growth potential\xa0as well as businesses that pay dividends, which can help mitigate market volatility.

Historical analysis further reinforces this viewpoint. Examining the average stock performance over an extended period offers a more detailed perspective. In the period from 1930 to 2022, the contribution of dividend income to the total return of the S&P 500 Index averaged 41%. However, savvy investors don't necessarily subscribe to the notion of long-term benefits from dividend stocks. Instead, they actively engage in short-term investments using a strategy known as Dividend Capture. This approach focuses on exploiting the periodic dividend payouts of stocks without committing to a long-term hold.

Investors redirected their attention away from these companies and shifted towards mega-cap tech firms, which garnered greater interest and investment. The change in preference may be attributed to the perceived higher growth potential and innovation associated with the tech sector compared to the more stable but slower-growing consumer staples industry. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index found itself as the second weakest sector within the large-cap benchmark index. This particular index monitors companies within the S&P 500 classified under the GICS consumer staples sector. Throughout 2023, it experienced a decline of 2.4%, marking it as the second-worst performer, with only the utility sector exhibiting poorer results. Despite this setback, there is a more optimistic outlook for the consumer staples sector, suggesting that its future performance may not be as gloomy as indicated by its recent downturn.', 'Consumer staples companies specialize in producing or selling essential goods, such as toilet paper, bread, and toothpaste—items that people continue to purchase consistently, even in challenging economic circumstances or job loss. This consistent demand for essential products offers advantages for both consumer staples stocks and their investors. These benefits include reliable and predictable revenues, as well as resilience during economic downturns. When coupled with operational excellence, the top consumer staples stocks demonstrate a steady and gradual growth in earnings and cash flow over an extended period. Analysts are expressing optimism for the sector in 2024 due to these capabilities. Filippo Falorni, Vice President and Equity Research Analyst at Citi, shared with BNN Bloomberg his anticipation that consumer staple stocks, often regarded by investors as substitutes for bonds, will yield favorable returns throughout the current year. This expectation is rooted in the belief that these stocks will perform well amid a slowing U.S. economy. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“The consumer has been more resilient than expected … and as a result, sectors that are more offensive have performed better than staples, which tend to perform better when you have more concerns around the (macroeconomics). We’re starting to see a little bit of a slowdown in consumer spending … so I think staples, in general, can become more of a preferred sector as we head into particularly the second half of 2024.”', 'The onset of the pandemic has created new opportunities for the consumer staples sector, particularly with the surge in online shopping. The shift in consumer behavior towards digital platforms has become a notable avenue for growth within the sector. According to a recent report by Bloomberg Intelligence, digital commerce is projected to expand its share of total US retail sales significantly. Starting at 25% in 2022, the report forecasts that digital commerce will account for a third of all retail sales by the year 2027. This anticipated growth underscores the increasing prevalence and influence of online transactions in the retail landscape, highlighting a notable shift in consumer shopping habits over the coming years.', 'The digitalization of the consumer staples sector contributes to its defensive characteristics. While traditionally viewed as defensive due to the consistent demand for essential products, the integration of digital technologies adds an extra layer of resilience. The sector may not generate exceptionally high returns, but it also exhibits stability and is less prone to abrupt failures. Moreover, many of these stocks provide dividends, which can be viewed as a tangible return on investment even before substantial growth occurs. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent consumer staples stocks that pay regular dividends to shareholders.

Sysco possesses many business characteristics that FMI finds attractive. The company has a dominant market position in a large, growing, resilient industry. They sell necessary, consumable products. Economies of scale allow Sysco to provide a better offering than peers while also allowing them to operate with higher margins. These advantages have helped Sysco take market share over time and earn a return on capital that consistently exceeds its cost of capital. We believe that Sysco will continue to grow its market share in the large and fragmented foodservice distribution market and should be able to generate mid-single-digit EBIT growth over time. When combined with share repurchases and dividend yield, the company should generate a high-single-digit to low-double-digit total return to investors without multiple expansion.

If you wish to skip our detailed overview of Kacher’s history, investment philosophy and hedge fund performance, go directly to Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 5 Picks.', 'Glen Kacher is the founder and chief investment officer at the hedge fund Light Street Capital. He attended University of Virginia where he graduated with B.S. Commerce at the McIntire School of Commerce. He obtained his MBA from Stanford University.', 'Kacher is among the famous figures in the hedge fund industry. The hedge fund boss, who chose to base his operations in Silicon Valley rather than Wall Street, learned investing from some of the industry’s greatest.\xa0\xa0', 'Prior to starting Light Street Capital in 2010, Kacher worked as managing director at the hedge fund Integral Capital Partners under industry titan Roger McNamee. During his time at Integral, which started in 1998, Kacher oversaw investments in the technology sector. His investment areas of focus included software, internet services and media.', 'Before he joined Integral, Kacher worked for the hedge fund Tiger Management under Julian Robertson – a pioneering figure in the hedge fund industry. Kacher went to work for the billionaire legendary hedge fund manager Robertson’s fund after he graduated college with a bachelor’s degree in commerce in 1993 and remained there until 1997.', 'At Tiger, Kacher initially worked as a full-time research analyst. At some point, Kacher transitioned to the role of a part-time investment consultant for the hedge fund. During his tenure at Tiger, he focused on investments in hardware, software and networking industries', 'Kacher came to launch Light Street Capital armed with a graduate business degree, years of experience in investing in the technology space and lessons from some of the industry’s best. Kacher’s Light Street Capital is one of the Tiger cubs – hedge funds whose founders had worked at Tiger Management.', 'Light Street Capital is a tech-focused hedge fund headquartered in Silicon Valley – the global epicenter of technology innovation. The firm has $680 million in assets under management. Light Street invests by applying long and short investment strategies.', 'Being based in Silicon Valley, Kacher has had a vantage view of the technology space, allowing him to better understand industry trends and spot opportunities ahead of others. In Silicon Valley, the Light Street Capital founder rubs shoulders with technology innovators, startup founders, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.', '""What I learned at business school was that Silicon Valley was the center of the creation of the internet industry… It seemed crazy to go back to New York."" Kacher once told Forbes.', 'The Silicon Valley insights help guide Kacher’s long and short investment strategies. For example, he takes long positions in industry disruptors and shorts the incumbents. After learning that business travelers preferred ride-hailing services like Uber to traditional rental car services, Kacher went about shorting rental car stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) and made good money out of it.', 'Also, Kacher shorts auto parts stocks because he believes that the rise of ride-sharing and electric cars will reduce consumer demand for auto parts.', 'As with all other hedge funds, Kacher’s Light Street Capital has had its hits and misses. There are years that it has delivered outstanding returns and years when it has suffered overwhelming losses.', 'From 2010 through 2017, Light Street’s annualized net returns stood at 19.8%. In 2017, the fund delivered returns of 38.6%. In 2018, its returns improved to 53% in the first 10 months of the year.', 'But 2021 and 2022 turned out to be punishing years for Kacher. His hedge fund lost 26% in 2021 and things only got worse in 2022 when the fund lost 54%. In 2022, soaring inflation, Russia’s war with Ukraine and rising interest rates combined to hurt technology companies. That dealt a heavy blow to tech-focused hedge funds such as Light Street Capital.', 'Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital', 'But the fund made a strong comeback in 2023, returning 46%. In 2023, tech stocks benefited from AI excitement, which led to the blockbuster returns at Light Street Capital.', 'The AI theme is expected to continue impacting tech stocks in 2024. In a recent interview with CNBC, Glen Kacher spoke about AI being a multi-decade opportunity.', 'While there will no doubt be ups and downs, the hedge fund boss noted that AI presents a huge tailwind and opportunity for investors. He sees the AI impact on technology companies being as massive as the previous major technology shifts, such as the shift from PCs to networks or SaaS software.', 'Kacher believes that AI presents a massive opportunity for the leaders in the technology sector and that AI is an incredible opportunity for investors to deploy their capital behind.', 'As to the best way for investors to get exposure to AI opportunities, Kacher believes that semiconductor stocks present a good opportunity. He notes that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the chip companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI.', 'Software companies are also great opportunities, according to Kacher. The hedge fund boss said that Magnificent Seven companies are best-positioned to ride the AI trend. He noted that these are companies with customers, massive data and massive amounts of capital.', 'AI is going to be a big deal for the tech industry in 2024. In Davos, industry experts spoke about 2024 being a potentially big year for AI. They noted that 2023 was the year of discovery when AI proved its ability and that 2024 will be the year when focus will be on improving the technology’s reliability so that those adopting it can be more comfortable with it.', 'Apart from AI continuing to attract more money to the technology stocks, the economic outlook also looks promising for tech companies. The Fed appears to have succeeded in cooling off inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Technology companies tend to thrive in an environment of low interest rates as borrowing becomes cheap and obtaining capital becomes easy.', 'Amid the continuing AI excitement and growing optimism over economic outlook as inflation cools and the Fed contemplates rate cuts, stocks are soaring in 2024 with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in January.', 'In its latest 13F filing, Light Street Capital revealed large stakes in semiconductor stocks that are expected to benefit from AI-fueled demand. The filing also shows that the fund remains heavily invested in software companies that develop AI tools or stand to benefit from integrating AI systems into their operations.', 'With these details in mind, let’s take a look at the top 15 stocks in Glen Kacher’s Light Street Capital portfolio.', 'Our Methodology ', 'Light Street Capital bounced back in 2023 after the rout of technology companies in 2022 wiped out some 70% of the firm’s assets. The hedge fund benefited from its long positions in some extensive tech stocks that exploded amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Consequently, we have analyzed the hedge fund 13F filings and settled on its top stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on Glen Kacher’s hedge fund’s holdings.

The ability to raise price only comes with attributes such as high switching costs and a limited competitive landscape. Cellebrite benefits from both, but has not aggressively flexed their pricing power to date. After being acquired by private equity, the company’s competitor, Grayshift, has reportedly been raising prices by more than 30% on select products. Cellebrite is taking more of a velvet glove approach, offering newer products with more functionality at higher prices, e.g., their “Premium” offering, which offers additional features and is, in fact, “premium” but is also 40-50% more expensive. The combination of raising prices, introducing new products, and cross-selling analytics products should fuel growth for the next several years. Extracting data from devices and making sense of it is not going to get easier nor is it going to become less mission-critical. Law enforcement needs tools to fight crime, and Cellebrite is the leading “arms dealer” to collect and review data from mobile phones.', 'Over the course of the quarter, Cellebrite hired an Executive Chairman from the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners.

Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy.

We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results, primarily on adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis.

Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.And now if you please turn to Page 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?"", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our quite good 2023 4th quarter and full year results with you this morning.As we turn to Page 4, let's look at today's agenda. This morning, I'll start by walking through our full year highlights and then we turn to commenting on our most recent acquisition, ProCare Solutions. Jason will then go through our quarterly results, both in aggregate and at the segment level, share our annual results and review our strong balance sheet position. Then I'll pick up and discuss our segment level annual results, our 2024 outlook, wrap up and turn to your questions. So let's go ahead and get started.Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the 2 key takeaways for today's call are: first, we delivered a very strong 2023. And second, we remain well positioned and are carrying positive momentum into 2024. As we look back on the full year, we're proud of what the organization accomplished. From a financial perspective, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth with free cash flow margins at 32%.Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth. Jason will cover this in a few minutes, but Q4 was strong as well with 13% total revenue growth and 8% organic revenue growth. Also during the year, we deployed $2.1 billion in the high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. As we all know, last year was a challenged year relative to available acquisition opportunities, given that I'm super proud of our team's ability to grow through the market conditions and successfully convert 2 outstanding value-creation M&A opportunities.Given all this, we entered this year with positive momentum. We continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical solutions. As a reminder, each of our businesses is a leader in their respective market and delivers system of record, network critical or vital and/or life-saving technologies. As a result, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions. Also, as we head into 2024, we have meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions, Syntellis, Replicon and Procare. It is important to highlight these additions to our portfolio of businesses also improved the underlying quality of our enterprise in terms of reoccurring revenue mix and organic growth profile.Finally, we continue to be very active in the M&A market, an environment that we expect to be notably improved in 2024 and with a strong balance sheet and a large pipeline of attractive opportunities. So a strong '23 and solid momentum, both organic and inorganic behind us as we enter 2024.Now please turn to the next page, Page 6, where we'll discuss our most recent acquisition, Procare Solutions. Procare Solutions is a fantastic addition to the Roper portfolio. Let's start with the fundamentals. We're paying $1.75 billion, net of $110 million tax benefit for the business. We expect ProCare to contribute about $260 million of revenue and $95 million of EBITDA for the 12 months ended Q1 '25.Procare will be accretive to our free cash flow in '24 and to our adjusted DEPS in '25. We'll fund the acquisition with a portion of a $3.5 billion revolver and will report Procare in our Application Software segment and expected deal to close this quarter. Procare meets all our long-standing acquisition criteria, leader in a smaller market, delivers mission-critical verticalized software solutions, competes based on customer intimacy, operates an asset-light business model and is led by a skilled, passionate leadership team.What is incrementally different for us is the maturing leader nature of this company. As we outlined during our Investor Day last year, our corporate strategy leans on implementing 2 modest improvements. First, continue to improve our long-term sustainable organic growth rate; and second, capture more value from our capital deployment capacity.Relative to additional capital deployment value capture, we are focusing on doing a higher proportion of bolt-on activity as evidenced by last year's capital deployment record and adding higher growth or maturing leader business profiles to our enterprise. Procare is a prototypical maturing leader archetype, meeting all our long-standing criteria that I mentioned above but a structurally faster growth business that possesses the opportunity to improve margins as the top line scales. For Procare, we expect mid-teens top line growth with improving margins from an already strong position for the years to come. Let's talk about what the company does.Procare is the leading provider of mission-critical and purpose-built software to 37,000 owners and operators of early childhood education centers which they use to run their business. The software provides all the needed functionality to run the childcare center, ranging from parent and family engagement, staff and teacher scheduling, classroom management, tuition billing and payment processing. The market itself is quite attractive and in the midst of a long-term secular tailwind of young dual-income families seeking higher levels of early child education versus daycare.In addition, like most industries, this one is undergoing long-term tech enablement. Given these factors, this market is growing annually in the low double-digit area. As mentioned, Procare is the leading player with a 1.5x role market share advantage in this space given their super compelling value proposition that combines both software and the integrated payments capabilities. Given this, Procare has very high gross retention and compelling net retention as well.Finally, from our extensive due diligence of the business, we're encouraged by the fact that broker has multiple strategic and operating pathways available to deliver mid-teens growth and long-term margin expansion. Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for Roper and our shareholders and to Joanne, your leadership team and all the Procare family, welcome to Roper.So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our very strong financial position. Jason?"", 'Jason P. Conley', ""Great. Thanks, Neil. I'll walk through the enterprise and segment results for Q4 and enterprise results for the full year, along with a review of our balance sheet. Starting with Q4 on Slide 7. We have an excellent finish to a strong year. Revenue of over $1.6 billion was 13% over prior year, led by 8% organic growth with acquisitions adding 4 points and less than a point of currency benefit.Organic outperformance was led by our TEP segment, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon. Gross margin of 69.7% was down 30 basis points versus prior year, given a higher mix coming from our TEP segment. EBITDA grew 11% to $659 million with EBITDA margin coming in at a solid 40.8%. With the offsetting impact of interest and taxes, this translated into debt's growth of 11% to $4.37, above our guidance range of $4.28 to $4.32. Also from a cash perspective free cash flow finished strong at $596 million, up 30% over prior year. This was in line with our expectations with a good renewal season across our software businesses.We turn to Slide 8, I'll briefly click into the segment performance in Q4. Application Software delivered revenue growth of 15% over prior year to $852 million, with organic growth contributing 7 points and the balance coming primarily from our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. EBITDA margin of 43.2% in the quarter was below prior year's high watermark of 45.6%, which as we discussed last year was driven by lower incentive-based compensation.Network software was up 3% and $363 million with EBITDA 10% to $208 million. As we have discussed before, our freight matching businesses are navigating a drawdown of carriers following exceptional marketplace growth over 2021 and 2022, which is mixing down the growth rate for the segment. However, our business leader at DAT and Load Link have aligned the cost base with reduced carrier subscribers to still drive solid EBITDA growth in the quarter.Our TEP segment grew by 17% in the quarter to $399 million, with EBITDA up 13% to $134 million. Growth was led by exceptional performance at Neptune with continued increasing demand for ultrasonic technologies and overall favorable market conditions. Also, Verathon continued its remarkable growth with strength in single-use products across laryngoscope and brochoscope. EBITDA margin of 33.6% was down from prior year, given some onetime investments and incentive compensation in the quarter.Turning to Slide 9, I'll walk through our full year 2023 performance. As Neil has mentioned, revenue was just under $6.2 billion, up 15% over prior year, with organic growth of 8% and acquisitions contributing 7 points, mainly in frontline and Syntellis. Looking at a 3-year revenue CAGR on this slide, similar to 2023, it's also at 15%. Further, the organic -- average organic growth rate over this 3-year period has been about 8%. Though as Neil mentioned, we benefited from some market conditions over that time period.EBITDA of just over $2.5 billion was up 16% over the prior year, yielding EBITDA margin of 40.6%. Our 3-year EBITDA over this period was also up 16%. So the story remains the same at Roper. We own and continually grow a portfolio of high gross margin businesses, and generally convert EBITDA growth to EBITDA in the 45% range, which allows for ample investment back into the business for future sustainable growth.Free cash flow for the year was just shy of $2 billion. which represents a 32% margin and is going Stanley up 32% over 2022. Full year contribution from our frontline acquisition and excellent performance across the enterprise drove this result. Underpinned by strong renewals, favorable DSO and improving inventory turns. Of note, our net working capital as a percent of annualized revenue was negative 19% in Q4, which is a new record for Roper. Importantly, over a 3-year period, we have compounded cash flow at 16%. Our consistent focus on growing cash flow and the strength of our new portfolio following our divestitures demonstrates a solid base from which to continue our long-term growth algorithm. To that end, we expect free cash flow margin to be 30% or more in 2024.With that, we can flip to Slide 10 to discuss our strong financial position. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the year with $3.14 billion available on our revolver with over $200 million of cash. Regarding leverage, we brought down net debt-to-EBITDA from 2.7x at the beginning of 2023 to a year-end figure of 2.4x despite deploying $2.1 billion towards acquisitions. We expect to close on Procare later in Q1 and will utilize our revolver to fund the transaction. So this will be our pro forma leverage to about 3x. Our solid balance sheet, coupled with strong cash generation gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more of capital while remaining committed to our solid investment-grade rating.Since our October call, deal activity has demonstrably increased with a corresponding lift in asset quality. That said, our market optimism remains balanced by our disciplined process and patient posture.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Neil to talk about our full year segment performance and indications for 2024. Neil?"", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's look back on the year for Application Software segment. Total revenues grew 21% and organic revenues grew 6% to $3.19 billion, while EBITDA margins remained strong at 43.7%. Within the segment, results were consistent with strength at Deltek, Aderant, Vertafore, Strata and Frontline.Deltek continued to see strong gains in our SaaS solutions, especially in the private sector markets, as discussed throughout the year, the Deltek market was tempered given all the uncertainty regarding government spending, notwithstanding Deltek delivered mid-single-digit organic growth for the year. In addition, they continue to innovate and add capabilities during times of uncertainty, which is a hallmark of Roper strategy, highlighted by the bolt-ons of Replicon and ProPricer. ProPricer smaller transaction, about $80 million purchase price, that closed late last year and delivers the leading contract pricing solutions and software for government contractors and federal agencies and ideal strategic fit for Deltek's Costpoint product family.Aderant was just amazing last year. They had record bookings and significant adoption of their anchor SaaS solutions and add-on products. Also, Aderant is one of the leaders within Roper, and the legal software market as it relates to productizing generative AI solutions within their product stack. Great job by Chris, Rafi and the entire team at Aderant.Continuing on, Vertafore was solid with strong ARR gains throughout the year. Additionally, Vertafore made great strides with our product strategy deployment and the MGA systems bolt-on is trending well ahead of our investment case. [Strata] also was quite good last year, both in terms of organic ARR gains and their acquisition and integration work associated with Syntellis. Finally, frontline executed well, delivering strong retention and cash flow during the year. As I mentioned earlier, we will report Procare solutions in this segment and expected deal to close this quarter. As it relates to our 2024 outlook for this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.Please turn with us to Page 13. Full year organic revenue for our Network segment grew 5% to $1.44 billion and margins were strong at 55.2%. We'll start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink which both grew in the year despite the year-long muted freight market conditions.Similar to that of Deltek, both businesses continue to innovate during the sluggish market with particularly interesting Gen AI innovations at DAT to help combat industry fraud. Pipeline delivered record bookings and had very strong customer retention and expansion activity, leading to strong ARR growth.Foundry, our postproduction media and entertainment software business muscle through the year given the writers and actor strikes and made meaningful progress in the transition to a full subscription revenue model. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP, were strong throughout the year as census levels in senior care facilities improved. As it relates to our full year 2024 guide for the segment, we expect to see low single-digit organic revenue growth based on the expectation of continued muted freight market conditions but with continued strong EBITDA margin performance.Now please turn to Page 14, and let's review our TEPs segment's results. Organic revenues for the year grew 15% to $1.55 billion and EBITDA margins remain consistent at 35.3%. As we look back over the year, we entered the year with a high degree of supply chain uncertainty. During the year, the vast majority of these uncertainties were resolved, and our businesses did a tremendous job of capturing the opportunity. As we exit '23 and look to '24, we do not see meaningful supply chain constraints.As usual, we'll start with Neptune, our water meter and technology business. Neptune was just great and continues to see strong demand and momentum for the residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters and increasing adoption of their meter data management software. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete.Verathon was awesome as well for the year. Verathon was strong across all 3 of their product families: Ultrasonic, Bladder volume measurement, video-assisted innovation and single-use bronchoscopy. As a reminder, Verathon's reoccurring single-use offerings now make up about 55% of the business' annual revenue stream. Just an amazing product and business execution journey to both scale and improve the underlying quality of the business. Finally, our RF product businesses, Inovonics and rf IDEAS, did a terrific job managing through their supply chain challenges and delivered very strong 2023 financial performance.Looking to our 2024 guidance for this segment. We expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for the full year and the expectation that Q1 will grow in the mid-teens area. Now please turn with us to Page 16. This morning, we're establishing our 2024 full year and first quarter guidance. For the full year, which includes the impact of Procare solutions, we expect to see total revenue growth between 11% and 12%.On an organic basis, we expect to see full year 2024 revenue grow between 5% and 6% and finally, we expect to see full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $17.85 and $18.15, which includes about $0.10 to $0.15 of DEPS dilution associated with the Procare deal. Assumed in this guidance a tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. We want to take a moment to set our guide in context of our long-term strategy and execution model. To remind everyone, historically, we operated a 5% to 6% organic growth portfolio. Our strategy and ambition are to structurally improve organic growth rate to be in the 8% to 9% area.Over the last 3 years, we grew 8%, 9% and 8% on an organic basis, though these years were benefited to some extent from certain market conditions. As such, our view is our current course and speed organic growth rate is in the 7% to 7.5% area. We are very pleased with our progress to date and continue to work to achieve organic growth aspirations. As it relates to organic revenue outlook for '24, we entered the year mindful of 2 factors: continued subdued large customer activity in our Application Software segment and our freight matching businesses within our Network segment, being below trend based on our expectations for continued muted freight market conditions. As it relates to the first quarter, we expect to see adjusted DEPS in the range of $4.30 and $4.34.Now please turn with us to Page 17, and then we'll look forward to your questions. As per our custom, we'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. One, we delivered another great year of performance; and two, we have continued positive momentum heading into 2024. Relative to 2023's performance, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth with free cash flow margins also at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned by 8% organic revenue growth. Importantly, free cash flow has grown 16% on a 3-year compounded basis and we delivered our first ever quarter of $1 billion of softer recurring and reoccurring revenues, quite an important milestone for enterprise.In addition, we deployed $2.1 billion towards high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon. In a year where deploying capital is structurally challenged and we did so at very compelling values, leading to strong value creation for our shareholders. As we enter 2024, we do so with strong momentum. We continue to see robust demand for our mission-critical solutions and a strong outlook for organic growth. Also, you can count on Roper to improve the underlying business quality as we scale our enterprise. Adding to the momentum for the year are the contributions from our 2023 acquisition cohort and last week's announcement of Procare solutions.Finally, we are well positioned to continue our capital deployment execution. We remain very active in the M&A market, an environment that we expect to be notably improved in 2024. We can do this with a strong balance sheet, a large pipeline of attractive opportunities and unwavering levels of patience and discipline.Now as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their organic growth rates and underlying business quality.Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow in the mid-teens area over the long arc of time.So with that, thank you for your continued interest in Roper, and let's open it up to your questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets."", 'Deane Michael Dray', 'Can we start with Procare and it\'s interesting. This is the first time I recall where you made a deal announcement, and I had not 1 but 2 people at RBC Research contact me and say, ""Hey, that they were active customers. And so -- and they show them the apps on their phone, and it was really interesting to see that dynamic. And my question here is I\'m really glad that you highlighted how they\'re a maturing leader and within that category. And what surprises me is how much growth there is? I mean, low single digit, maybe low double digit to mid-teens.As you start to see that type of growth might the private equity sellers have a bias where maybe that\'s a public company exit. That\'s always been the kind of adage go for these more orphan businesses, there is no public company exit. They\'re more apt to sell to you at a reasonable price. If you start looking at some of these growthier businesses like Procare, even at a maturing leader category, Might that stretch the multiples because the private equity players might have a public company exit in mind. So maybe we can start there.', 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Yes. So I think first, I appreciate the comments on Procare. I think there's like 80,000 5-star ratings in the app store, so your colleagues are a couple of many about the -- liking the application and the engagement with their kids and their early child education centers. The -- relative to the question about the IPO as a competitor. I mean maybe on some transactions, but most of what we're going to look at are going to be subscale for the IPO market. The TAM here is sub $1 billion. That's not a very IPO-able type market. So this is, again, a small market leader, the market is growing low double digits that we talked about, which underpins the mid-teens growth rate we're underwriting to here.In terms of valuation and multiples, I think we're just in a world where sellers, especially private equity sellers understand the cost of capital where the world is. They have constraints from their LPs. They need to get liquidity back to them. They can't raise new funds without it. And so I mean it's hard to guess what this asset would have traded for 12 to 18 months ago, but substantially, substantially higher on a multiple basis. So we think for the moment, the valuations are coming to us because of the market forces that we just talked about."", 'Jason P. Conley', ""I think in this current environment, liquidity is really key. So if you do an IPO, you don't get your liquidity right away. So I think that's pretty important."", 'Deane Michael Dray', 'And this might be more of a nuance. But at your Analyst Day, you talked about a willingness to look at businesses that might be at an earlier stage of development and is on that spectrum, does Procare is a maturing leader? Is that something you could have acted sooner on -- and when Jason talked about the level of activity, how within the funnel, are there businesses that are at that earlier stage that might look attractive?', 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Procare is like a perfect example by earlier stage, right? So these are not early-stage companies. They're earlier than what we've typically acquired in the past. So they meet all of our criteria. I have to emphasize that every time we talk about maturing leaders. So it's a leader in a small market. The base of competition is understood and observable in the marketplace. The relative market share advantage this company has is particularly interesting. So those are common traits of everything we've always acquired. This case, the market is growing a little bit faster and the underlying business model, margins are going to scale as the business grows. So that's the earlier part of what we're talking about.Historically, we would have maybe waited to by Procare until the next trade, the one after the one that just occurred. And so when we look at the model of this over a long arc, it's just much more value for our shareholders to do this type of transaction.In terms of the pipeline, it is, as Jason said in his comments, and I said in my comments, just a noticeable change in activity since our last call in the marketplace for some of the reasons that we talked about. The -- and it's a variety of opportunities. I mean we're leaning into doing more bolt-ons. So there's a fair amount of bolt-on activity in there. That's a lot of what Janet her team are working to build. And then there's a fair number of these emerging maturing leaders -- excuse me, maturing leader type profiles, and we'll just have to -- we'll be patient and disciplined to figure out the right ones for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.', 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""Maybe just following up on Procare. If you could clarify a little bit just the financial impact. I think you said maybe $0.10 to $0.15 hit for the year in that guide. So maybe just sort of clarify around that -- is it kind of a smaller hit in Q1 because of the timing of the deal close and then we just spread the rest out over the balance? Any thoughts on kind of the seasonality of the Procare business? And then how quickly you'll get that sort of related debt down?"", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Yes, sure, Julian. So we expect to close in March, that's sort of our assumption right now. So the way that plays out is of the $0.15, maybe $0.02 in the first quarter. So we expect for the calendar year around $75 million of EBITDA. And then we'll, obviously, from an interest perspective, we'll reload on the revolver, which is going to be at around 6%. And so -- and obviously -- cast out through the rest of the year. So that's how I can get to your $0.10, $0.15 for the year. In terms of seasonality, not a ton of seasonality for the business. And of course, it's growing nicely. So that sort of worked through any aberrations you'd have between quarters."", 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""That's helpful. And then just homing in on network software for a second. So you have that sort of softness in the freight markets that's been sort of well understood for some time. Foundry was also weak for some of last year. So are we thinking that in the context of that low single-digit organic growth guide for the year in network software. Just trying to understand, are you assuming kind of a slower start than a pickup in the back half or it's a steady sort of 3% growth rate dialed in just like how you exited 2023."", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""I'll take the first kind of and then ask Jason, anything wants to add any color. So you're right, the call -- I mean the principal driver of the growth rate in this range for '24 is DAT and length and freight matching businesses. Foundry, had, as we talked about, had a tough '23 with actors and writer strike. On top of that, they started the migration to a full subscription model and so '24 will be a bit muted for Foundry as well, but that's small relative to the impact of DAT and the Canadian Freight Match businesses. We've assumed sort of muted conditions throughout the whole year. There certainly are market prognosticators that are suggesting a second half pickup. We've not assumed that in our model. We want to see it before we load it in and that's our core assumption relative to the Freight Match businesses."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.', 'Brent John Thill', ""Curious just to get the thoughts on organic growth in '24, obviously, taking a pretty meaningful step down from what you did last year? Maybe if you can explain that and the initial guide and what you're baking in for the overall guide for '24?"", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Sure. I mean it's -- I'll just comment and share a few of the thoughts we said in the prepared remarks, right? So the -- our long-term aspirations are to grow organically in the 8% to 9% range, and we believe we have the possibility to do that. It's going to take a few more years to get into that run rate that's the aspiration of what we're all working towards both in the group executives and all the operating teams across the company. As you know, the last 3 years, it was an 8%, 9%, 8% throughout that whole period of time. We said we -- those were benefited by some market tailwinds, some comeback from the pandemic, a raging freight market. Things like that, supply chain sort of bottlenecks and releases, and that was sort of in the last 3 years.So as we look at this year compared to history and then also are the possible. And we think our current course of speed is in the 7% to 7.5% range organic growth through all that noise. So as we compare what we're doing in '24 against all that, it really is 2 simple reconciling factors. One is we just talked about the last question, the freight markets being slow this -- our expectation for them to be slow throughout the whole year. And then as we talked about for a few quarters last year in our Application Software segment, there was notably less large customer activity like enterprise class customer activity.Deltek, a little bit, we talked about at frontline, a little bit of smaller business called data novations, which all makes sense large company is anticipating a slowdown, they just got cautious in their buy behavior. The good news is Deltek ended Q4 with a fair amount of momentum. I think they're up low double digits, either high single or low double digits in the quarter. So they exited with a fair amount of momentum. It's one data point. We want to see a few of those down together. And so we're -- those are the 2 recoiling items, the freight slowdown, expectation slowdown in large activity application. That's embedded in our model and those are reconciled factors between last year and where we are this year and also pretty much a reconciling factor between where we are this year and where we think we are from a run rate."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird.', 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""I guess I wanted to pick off on the last answer and maybe contextualize a bit more of the outlook specifically for application software. I appreciate the comments on subdued activity with large accounts. Do you happen to maybe have the trend in enterprise bookings? And then any other forecasting considerations to call out? Because I guess I'm trying to reconcile the good step-up at year-end against the mid-single outlook, but that might just be related to the planning kind of assumptions you just mentioned, Neil."", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Yes, I think the step up at the end, I mean, Deltek was strong in Q4. And it's one data point. The pipeline looks attractive. The pipeline for frontline looks attractive at both the enterprise and the SMB portion of their business, but we've been through the better part of 3, 4 quarters where the enterprise activity was slow, and we're just not going to underwrite to that in our guidance at the moment."", 'Jason P. Conley', 'In terms of enterprise bookings, they were low single digits, which is consistent for the full year this year and sort of consistent with what we said all year long around just lower activity at the enterprise level.', 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""Okay. Great. And then I wanted to ask, there's some exogenous events like you mentioned Foundry. I think they communicated that they're now exclusively subscriptions here in 2024. You also have a lot of other businesses that have big on-prem maintenance streams that can get a multiplier over time. So there's things that are hurting and helping, I suppose, do you have a sense on a blended and net basis, what this might be contributing to the model in 2024? And when you think about growth improving from the 7% to 7.5% range what these types of items might ultimately mean over the next couple of years?"", 'Jason P. Conley', ""So I can take the first part of that, Joe, and then maybe Neil can take the second. So in terms of the application software, we still expect it to be strong in the mid-singles. I think nonrecurring revenue will still kind of be flattish we still expect that sort of shift to SaaS to continue, and that's kind of been a small headwind for us throughout the last couple of years, but it's been overcome by the things we talked about, which was enterprise bookings, which we didn't get in '23. So again, recurring is going to be strong. Nonrecurring will be flattish. As Deltek picks up in '24, especially in the large GovCon enterprise, there could be upside in the year because a lot of those customers are still buying on-premise licenses.So that could be an opportunity, but we didn't bake any of that into our guidance. And then when we look at network, recurring will clearly be down low single digits just based on DAT and Loadlink, at least based on our current assumptions. And to your point, I think nonrecurring will be fairly muted as well because we'll still be -- we'll be at the last point of that conversion of Foundry off license to subscription. So they didn't mandate that in '23, they will mandate in '24, we'll be digesting that last piece there and then on to the 7%..."", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""I think just more longer term on the SaaS migration. We have a little bit over $900 million in on-premise maintenance. That as that converts it converts our recent history, the last 2 or 3 or 4 years. It's north of 2x on an ARR basis as it converts from on-premise maintenance to SaaS and cloud. So when we do that, it's actually going to -- we believe, historically, it's been a bit of a net growth driver while we might -- we will convert perpetual licenses, which are in-period onetime revenue to SaaS, and that's a classic J curve.The companies that are undergoing this transition, we're going to convert this $900-plus million of maintenance at a clip that will overwhelm that J-curve effect. So we believe it's a net growth driver. Foundry is a bit unique in that they're making a just almost like a day 1 pivot in their business model shift and the other companies are doing more of a migratory approach."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.', 'Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic', ""Just want to turn to tech-enabled products. Obviously, a strong year. As we think about that guide, and Neptune and Verathon certainly big components of that growth. Does that kind of diverge to some extent? Does one start to outpace the other? It seems like there's a lot of development at Verathon that could drive some of that. Just any thoughts there?"", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""I mean both, as we talked about, both Neptune and Verathon were just great in last year, both grew faster than the segment. Obviously, they are a predominant element of the segment. We believe that the long-term growth rate at Neptune is probably in the high single digits area. And we believe that the long-term organic growth rate of Verathon is probably a bit higher than that. It's -- we want to believe that it's going to be low double digits. We want to see a couple more years of that, some more R&D productivity. We're super encouraged by the pipeline of R&D and the momentum they have in the market across the 3 product categories. So that's where we expect the long-term growth rates to be there."", 'Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic', ""Got it. And then just following up on the M&A side of things, leverage at 3x, obviously, strong cash flow generator. But it sounds like the pipeline is incredibly active with quality transactions. What's the comfort level in terms of going above that range? Is there a way to think through that? Just any thoughts."", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""I mean we're always -- our long-term policy is between 3x to 3.5x. If you look back to 2015, '16, you can never be right at that level, some of you go above it, come below it. It's always this process and where you draw the line through those swings. We're going to just what's -- business model pickers, as you know. We're going to continue to look for the very best businesses at the most attractive valuations that meet all of our criteria, and then we'll look for the best way to finance those from that point. We certainly understand, I think, acutely risk, both risk in the businesses, risk in the capital structure, and that's a big part of how we think about deploying capital and how we value assets."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.', 'Christopher D. Glynn', ""I had a question about the TEP segment. So you commented on the supply chain issues from the last couple of years all resolved. So curious if you're seeing some nice benefits emerge from production planning and if that drives some natural margin and productivity tailwinds that we should see in the margins in 2024."", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Well, I think scaling certainly helps. We've added a fair amount of capacity at Neptune. We've added supplier capacity at Verathon. We've added supplier capacity at the RF IDEAS -- the rf products businesses. And certainly, we're not the similar from most companies. The supply chain operations teams are going from a model that was focused for the last 3 or 4 years on resiliency to maybe a more balance between resiliency and sort of just in time, which certainly will help with inventory turns and asset velocity.So we do think there's a little bit of money trapped in inventory for us. It will be more of a working capital advantage if we can execute on that plan. In terms of margins, I'll look at Jason. I think it's probably more just scaling infrastructure. I mean what we -- our cost of goods is so low relative to industrial type companies that the input cost or fraction of the cost structure of our enterprise, but your thoughts about that?"", 'Jason P. Conley', ""Yes. No, I think we'll have leverage that will be a little bit above what the EBITDA margin is for the business. I mean we do have some of the growth that we're seeing is in single-use products, which are great because they have a lot of recurring revenue or the reoccurring revenue, but they come at a little bit of a lower margin. And then when Neptune grows, it has a little bit of impact on the segment too. So I would expect leverage to be consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years just based on those factors."", 'Christopher D. Glynn', 'Great. And then about the aspiration to 8% to 9% organic growth and driving things higher. Certainly, I understand you have a lot of coordination of experts and best practices across the enterprise. What would you characterize as top of the list businesses with particular action plan opportunities in that respect.', 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""So we appreciate the question, right? So we started this portfolio of 5% to 6% growth. We're in a way point of, we think 7% to 7.5% on the way to 8% to 9%. So we've made a fair amount of progress over the last 4 or 5 years. It's less about which company. It's more about the process and discipline across the all 27 now going to 28 companies. And you've heard us talk about this on repeat in the past, but it's just were, if anything, we're consistent. So it's about how do each of our businesses design a strategy in terms of where to play and how to win and where they have the right to lend for durable long-term growth. The second thing is that how do you process enable the execution of that strategy so that you're on repeat. We can use our long-term forever ownership period as a long-term competitive advantage.So as we stack capabilities that become enduring, then we can outpace our competitors. And then third, is how do we run a talent offense where we use talent as a long-term competitive advantage. We've talked a lot about the upgrade at the field leadership level over the last 3 or 4 years. The expectation for performance is much higher, much, much higher. The alignment of our compensation is tighter to that expectation. And so it's all reacting in unison that you get the Verathon that a decade ago or low single-digit growers and now hopefully low double-digit growers. You take businesses like Deltek, they have the mid and they come solidly mid-plus or maybe they can inch in the high singles over time. So it's about every business doing a little bit better on a sustainable basis."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.', 'Joseph Craig Giordano', ""On DAT, obviously, the freight market is weak. Can you just -- I know we've talked about that relationship kind of being somewhat inverse in weak markets where they actually tend to do better. Is that -- but just to put a finer point on that, is that more like on negative inflections in the market where it kind of spikes and then if it's like prolonged weakness that ultimately is forced to like trickle into DAT. Is that how we should really think about that?"", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""So DAT dynamics are a little bit different than what you described. DAT is when the freight markets are very strong, DAT grows in line or maybe ahead of that strength. When the freight markets are weaker, they tend to slow down. And then the sort of -- so therefore, if you look at their growth, it's more like stair step-type growth. In this particular case, because we're coming off such a surge for a couple of 3 years, it's a little bit more exaggerated.The dynamic that you're describing perfectly describes our ConstructConnect business, which is the construction analytics business where when the -- when you think about building product manufacturers and contractors and subcontractors subscribed to your content about what commercial real estate buildings are in the process of being planned and built. They want to look for where their next jobs are going to come from. So in the construction markets, the real estate markets are white hot and contractors are fully subscribed years out. The value of our information is less when the market slows and their backlog is spending then the value of what we offer is much higher. So we tend to have a little bit of a countercyclical sort of demand driver inside the construction activity.So by the way, Matt and his team, the ConstructConnect are working to balance out and have done a good job. So hopefully, to go forward will be up in up markets and up and down markets, but that's the -- that's what our product strategy is trying to execute."", 'Joseph Craig Giordano', ""That's good color. Just like a broader question, obviously, we're getting like more and more layoff announcements at like, I guess, that companies across the spectrum from tech to UPS. So how are you guys like in your discussions with your customers -- what's the most recent kind of read they're having on where head count stands and what the implications are for your businesses there that's somewhat dependent on that."", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Yes. I think unfortunately, our read across the macro market isn't a great one, right? Because we operate at these relatively insulated end markets, government contractors, property and casualty insurance where brokerages employment is higher, life insurance where employment is higher, healthcare where employment is higher, education where employment seems stable, if not higher, right? We're in the sort of relatively isolated, protected end markets where the macro swings aren't -- don't impact that much. It doesn't have that much impact on the way we drive compliance bookings in our -- across our portfolio. I will say for the labor market, generally loosening up has been advantageous for us all to have been able to not just fully staff at our business level, but use this opportunity to last probably 12 months plus to significantly upgrade talent across the organization."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist.', 'Terrell Frederick Tillman', ""Maybe just one question for you. I guess it's for you, Neil, is what we've seen with our vertical SaaS companies and even horizontal SaaS companies in the past, when they get those customers on the new modern architecture, it really can start to reduce the friction to buy those other add-on modules. And so what I'm curious about is you called out some of your businesses in the past like Deltek that have seen improving growth. Anything you can share around kind of net revenue retention from those customers that move to cloud? And I know it's still early days, but is there a propensity to buy those add-on modules, does it speed up? Does it quicken and that's just one of these things that could be a cumulative benefit over time and also help on that organic growth. And then I have a follow-up."", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Super appreciate that question. The short answer is categorically, yes. And we see that, first, when you do the lift and shift, from a legacy product to the current cloud delivery product. There's a migratory benefits that we talked about. Strata is a good example. Same-store sales, 2 to 2.5x uplift. But then while they're doing that, the checkbooks open, and they buy more modules at that moment where total ARR goes up over 3x and they lift and shift their customer base. Same can be said slightly different metrics, Aderant, Vertafore, et cetera. .And so what you're talking about is one of the principal benefits both to the customer and to us, our companies for delivering cloud-delivered SaaS deliver software, which is being able to be on the most recent release to be able to take advantage of all the R&D innovation and more easily be able to take additional products because of the delivery mechanism is faster and the implementations are more smooth. So you're exactly right. We're seeing it across the portfolio and expect to see a lot more of that in the years to come."", 'Terrell Frederick Tillman', ""That's great. I appreciate that. And I guess just a follow-up question. And I know you want to be careful in not revealing too much, but if the M&A environment does start opening up more and there's more shots on going, just more things that are interesting, albeit taking into account your discipline. I'm curious, just bigger picture. Usually, it's vertical SaaS. But what about interesting niche horizontal SaaS solutions, whether it's back office or kind of middle office or front office and/or secondarily, the idea of maybe software companies with a meaningful payments business."", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""So as we always said, will always be we're going to be business model pickers. The reason historically, we've been attracted to vertical -- small market verticalized software businesses is because the basis of competition needs to be able to be understood and observed. We want to be able to compete based on both the value proposition of the product, but also the intimacy with the customer and the customer relationship.The vast majority of our companies, their customers want us to win right, that we are so integral to what they do. They want us to win. They're always giving us input and feedback about how to be better, how to deliver more value to them. And so it's those dynamics that we look for. There are certainly some nichey horizontal type things that meet those criteria, but not a lot. right? A lot of the horizontal have gigantic TAMs, you compete on the base of an algorithm. There's very little loyalty to the company. So those types of things will never invest in.Relative to your comment about payments. Business models are -- we have a variety of business models. The software is on-prem, they're SaaS. We just bought a business that is the integration of SaaS software and payments, where you have deep embedded integration with what the company does and the products do with the payment stream. And so it's a business model. We're open-minded to the business model construct as long as there's an immense amount of durability embedded in the business model."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Alexander Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.', 'Alexander M. Blanton', ""I have some questions on Procare and -- the first one is, you've indicated that it's not accretive to adjusted EPS for this year. And if not, then there's some dilution. How much is that? You might have mentioned that earlier, I might not have caught it."", 'Jason P. Conley', ""Alex, this is Jason. So we assume around $75 million of EBITDA and then the interest is going to be $1.86 billion at, call it, 6%, which is our revolver, our current revolver rate. And so that's how you get to your calendar dilution number."", 'Alexander M. Blanton', 'But what is that number in EPS?', 'Jason P. Conley', '$0.10 to $0.15.', 'Alexander M. Blanton', 'Okay. So that accounts for the shortfall in the guidance versus the consensus you say $0.10 or $0.15 dilution.', 'Jason P. Conley', 'Correct.', 'Alexander M. Blanton', ""Okay. Now going forward, if you're growing at double digits, mid-teens, that implies that you're going to get some pretty good accretion in 2025, correct?"", 'Jason P. Conley', ""Absolutely. Yes. We're looking forward to the accretion after '24, and it will come, like I said, it's grown mid-teens, very good cash conversion dynamics. We have a little bit of a tax benefit this year, the next year and a couple of years out after that. So yes, feeling good about Procare's contribution to our growth going forward."", 'Alexander M. Blanton', ""Now can you give us an idea of what the total available market is in their business? And I assume it's all domestic at this point. And how do they look compared with that? In other words, with their market share or approximate? I understand that the leading provider, but it looks like it might be a fragmented market."", 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""So the TAMs today is about $750 million. It's growing about 10% a year. So you can do the math on what we said the next 12 months, March '25, it's 260. So you got to grow the market at 10% do the math on their current market share and their relative market share position. So their size relative to their next largest competitor is about 1.5x. The market we would characterize as having a number of legacy technology players and Procare and the Principal competitor are generally replatforming the market from a technology perspective."", 'Alexander M. Blanton', 'Okay. Finally, in that market, there are different sizes to the groups that you might be serving. There are nursery schools, for example, that have several hundred students, and there are small ones that are much smaller. Where do you fit in that? Do you -- are you aiming at the -- or serving the smaller schools as the larger ones or both?', 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Really appreciate the opportunity to address this question because one of the aspects of the business that we like quite a bit. So the way that we segment the market are basically enterprise, mid- and single operators, so 10-plus centers, 1 to 10 centers and a single operator center. Procare is the demonstrable leader -- relative market share advantage substantially higher than the 1.5x in both the enterprise and the mid and the growth rate in the enterprise and the mid is actually growing faster in the overall market.So the markets -- the segments were -- and then Procare also is highly competes very well in the single operator. I don't want to not comment on that. They could be very effectively there as well, but the strongest and have the largest market share in the enterprise and mid, which means that as the market consolidates ever so slowly over time, that accretes to our advantage."", 'Alexander M. Blanton', 'Okay. And finally, is there any foreign business there available? Or are you looking to get into that or not?', 'Laurence Neil Hunn', ""Yes. International is not a meaningful part of the business today. It is certainly something that we will consider in the long-term strategic outlook for the business, but not something in probably the near term because there's so much opportunity domestically to go -- to get after."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.', 'Zack Moxcey', 'Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. The conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation.

With shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) now on the outside looking in (Cramer removed it from the Magnificent Seven) following its brutal quarterly flop, questions linger as to which other growth companies are more deserving of a spot in the group.', 'Therefore, in this piece, we’ll check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to stack up two candidates that I believe are deserving of consideration now that Tesla is no longer magnificent enough to stay in the Magnificent Seven.', 'Remember the days when the FAANG (also a term and cohort created by Jim Cramer) group was dominating the financial headlines, powering broader markets higher? If you’re a new investor who jumped into the market waters within the past two years, you’re probably more familiar with the Magnificent Seven group. Either way, I do think the “N” — Netflix — in the original FAANG is starting to prove its potential once again, and this has me incredibly bullish about its future.', 'The stock took a massive beating back in late 2021 and early 2022, crashing by around 75% from peak to trough. The implosion caused Netflix stock to be scratched out of the conversation, ultimately marking the beginning of the end of FAANG and the beginning of the Magnificent Seven group.', 'Today, Netflix is making an epic comeback, proving its doubters wrong, with a handful of impressive quarters that have helped fuel a more than 220% gain off its 2022 lows. Indeed, competition in the streaming space was getting intense, and as the pandemic lockdown winners reversed course in violent fashion, it was natural to think that Netflix was on its way out of the conversation.', 'After the latest impressive number, though, Netflix has proven to us all that it is still magnificent and that the 2021-22 crash was a blunder made by Mr. Market. The original streaming kingpin remains king, with its impressive content that’s kept users coming back, even following substantial price hikes. Additionally, the ad-based tier and gaming expansion have made the firm more of a growth stock again.', 'Only time will tell if Netflix is headed for new heights as it continues adding to its strength in the new year. Unbelievably, shares are down around 18% from their peak in 2021. With co-founder Reed Hastings slashing his stake by $1.1 billion, gains will be harder to come by in the new year. The stock’s already endured quite a bit of multiple expansion in recent quarters. So much so that some analysts have been downgrading it due to valuation concerns.', 'At 46.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), the stock is pricier than its historical average and that of its peer group. While Netflix stock deserves a premium, I believe the company will need to keep releasing high-quality content and experience more success with its gaming push if it’s to keep growth at the level that warrants inclusion into the “Magnificent Seven.”', 'Can it be done? I think it can. Management has really executed, and the stock reflects a massive rebound in investor confidence.', 'Netflix stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with 27 Buys, 13 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average NFLX stock price target\xa0of $574.01 implies 1.8% upside potential.', 'Adobe stock is another tech titan that’s been scorching hot in 2023, blasting off nearly 70% in the past year. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a huge reason why Adobe stock has been able to turn the tide so fast. With impressive AI technologies (think Firefly and Sensei) ingrained into the company’s already impressive creative suite, the firm may have the means of charging its users even more.', 'If it’s adding more value, users should be more than willing to pay the higher price. As Adobe continues embracing the AI age, I can’t help but stay bullish on the stock.', 'In fact, I view AI as the catalyst that could propel ADBE stock right back to all-time highs. Recently, BakerAvenue’s King Lip stated that the company’s AI business is “extremely compelling.” With such a sizeable and loyal installed user base, upselling AI offerings is likely to be no issue for the firm.', 'It’s not just about putting profound AI power into creative hands that has me most intrigued. Given the horrific headlines surrounding AI-generated deep fakes of Taylor Swift that went viral, I believe more attention ought to be placed on AI guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI products.', 'In that regard, I believe Adobe is a firm that can put the appropriate guardrails in place to prevent (or minimize) misuse of AI tools. As the company moves on from its abandoned Figma acquisition, look for the firm to become as much of an AI innovator as it is a major player in AI safety and ethics.', 'All things considered, Adobe stock stands out as a magnificent tech firm worthy of more investor (and Cramer) praise.', 'Adobe stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with 24 Buys, four Holds, and two Sells assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average ADBE stock price target\xa0of $653.43 implies 5.8% upside potential.', 'Undoubtedly, there are a slew of high-growth companies that are doing incredibly well, with drivers that could help keep growth elevated for some time. That alone doesn’t guarantee a spot with the now six magnificent companies (the so-called Super Six, if you will).', 'However, I do think Netflix and Adobe are companies worthy of the most exclusive and enviable high-growth cohort out there. Between the two, analysts expect more upside from Adobe (5.8%) for the year ahead.', 'Disclosure']"

An SEC filing from Jan. 24 shows Hastings giving the 2 million shares to an unnamed entity. The filing includes a transaction code marked “G,” which indicates a “bona fide gift.”', 'It’s a stunningly large donation, not just Hastings’s largest ever, but representing something like 20% of his net worth. After this donation, Hastings is worth an estimated $4.1 billion, per Forbes, much of which is tied up in his remaining ownership of just under 3 million Netflix shares through his family trust, worth roughly $1.7 billion.', 'Hastings, along with his wife, Patty Quillin, has long supported an array of charitable initiatives, including a gift of $120 million to the United Negro College Fund and two historically Black colleges in 2020. Hastings and Quillin have also signed Bill Gates and Warren Buffett’s Giving Pledge. But because of its structure, this particular contribution likely comes with stunningly large tax savings.', 'The gift went to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF), a charity geared at addressing systemic inequalities in the Bay Area, a Netflix spokesperson told Bloomberg, which was among the first to report on the donation. The gift will likely be used in the foundation’s initiatives for affordable housing, childhood development, and disaster relief, among other causes.', 'SVCF is a popular destination for the area’s philanthropic tech billionaires; Twitter founder Jack Dorsey is a donor, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, his wife, have given $1.5 billion to SVCF, Variety reported.', 'The Wall Street Journal reported on a different reason for this charity’s popularity, especially with Northern California tech luminaries: privacy and the biggest possible tax break. The foundation offers “donor-advised funds” that allow figures like Hastings to both donate and advise specifically on how the donation will be used.', 'There is a long-standing benefit in the U.S. tax code with donations as, depending on the donor’s bracket, the deduction against current income can go as high as 30%. This allows the donor to avoid capital-gains tax on appreciation of equity investments. And giving to a donor-advised fund sponsor, like SVCF, can mean 50% savings, Ray Madoff, a Boston College law professor who specializes in philanthropy, taxes, and estate planning, told the Journal: “By taking your property instead of cash, they’re maximizing your tax benefits.”', 'It’s not clear what deduction Hastings will get, to be sure, but there are three main tax benefits people stand to gain for their charitable giving. The first: If they give cash, they can offset their income (although this only applies to people who itemize their deductions, which less than 10% of the population does). Benefit two: If you give appreciated property, as Hastings did, you won’t have to pay that capital gains, which saves another 20% in taxes. Third: You can get up to 74% tax benefit for a charitable donation. In other words, a $100 million donation can ultimately save a tax payer up to $74 million.', 'Hastings isn’t the only billionaire giving away much of his wealth. Last year alone, MacKenzie Scott recently revealed, she unloaded a quarter of her stake in Amazon—worth over $10 billion—and she has long made clear her commitment to give most of her fortune away.', 'And Mark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation, told Fortune last week that the charity intends to spend its entire endowment within 20 years of Bill and Melinda Gates’ deaths. “But we are actually having active discussions in our board about whether we might want to potentially even accelerate that a little bit,” Suzman said.', 'Hastings stepped into his executive chairman role at Netflix last year, following 25 years as its chief executive. The streaming giant is currently helmed by co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark."", 'Mark E. Lashier', ""Thanks, Jeff. Welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter earnings call. We delivered a strong quarter and a strong year. In 2023, our total shareholder return was 33%, and we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%. Today, we're going to cover a few major items, including the reasons why Phillips 66 is an attractive investment opportunity, and we'll highlight the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Next, we'll discuss our fourth quarter financial results, then we look forward to your questions. On Slide 3, we summarize the attributes that make us a differentiated and attractive value proposition. Our diversified and integrated portfolio delivered strong returns on capital employed and a high payout ratio supported by dividend growth. We're on a path to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by 40% to $14 billion by 2025. In addition, 75% of this growth will be outside of Refining. We expect this growth and more stable cash flow to support our valuation going forward and contribute to attractive total shareholder returns. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation across our portfolio has contributed to an average return on capital employed of 13% since our formation in 2012, almost double our cost of capital. We're committed to financial flexibility, and our strong investment-grade credit rating remains differentiated relative to our peers. We expect to return in excess of 50% of our growing operating cash flow to shareholders. All of these attributes will support a secure, competitive and growing dividend, strong share repurchases as well as debt reduction at mid-cycle margins. Slide 4 summarizes our achievements to date on our strategic priorities. On our last call, we raised our targets and continued to successfully execute our plan to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA and grow shareholder distributions. Since July of 2022, we've distributed $8.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends. We're on track to achieve our $13 billion to $15 billion target by the end of 2024. The execution of our plan to enhance Refining operating performance has resulted in crude utilization rates above the industry average for 4 consecutive quarters. In fact, we operated at our highest annual rate since 2019. We remain focused on improving performance, increasing market capture and reducing costs to enhance our earnings per barrel. In Midstream, our NGL wellhead-to-market business continues to exceed our expectations. The team has done a remarkable job of integrating DCP Midstream and captured run rate synergies of $250 million as of year-end, and we expect over $400 million of synergies by 2025. Since increasing our ownership of DCP, the Midstream annual run rate for adjusted EBITDA has been $3.6 billion. The stable cash generation from our Midstream business has grown to a level that covers the company's top capital priorities, funding sustaining capital and the dividend. We're delivering on business transformation targets and remain laser-focused on further reducing our cost structure in 2024. Kevin will be providing more details. In addition, we plan to monetize assets that no longer fit our long-term strategy. These asset dispositions are expected to generate over $3 billion in proceeds that will support our strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders. Timing of these dispositions will be subject to satisfactory market conditions and any necessary regulatory approvals. Our total adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $12.7 billion, reflecting above mid-cycle margins in Refining and nearly $6 billion contributed by our more stable Midstream and Marketing and Specialties businesses. We're focused on disciplined capital allocation, only funding attractive high-return projects across our portfolio. The Rodeo Renewed project to convert our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities is expected to generate strong returns. The project is progressing well, and we expect to start up later this quarter. Looking forward, we're well positioned to achieve our targets by capitalizing on the strengths of our diversified and integrated portfolio. We'll do this through continued operating and commercial excellence to deliver significant shareholder value through the economic cycles, as demonstrated by our total shareholder return of 33% in 2023. Our commitment to a secure, competitive and growing dividend has resulted in a 16% compound annual growth rate since 2012. Before I turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results, I'd like to thank the Phillips 66 team for their continued dedication to safe and reliable operations. Our employees enable us to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver on our mission to provide energy and improve lives. Kevin, over to you."", 'Kevin J. Mitchell', ""Thank you, Mark. I'll start on Slide 5 with an update on our business transformation progress and how we are reducing costs to sustain higher cash generation. We achieved $1.2 billion in run rate savings as of year-end 2023, comprised of $900 million of cost reductions and $300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. Sustaining capital is one of our business transformation success stories. Our sustaining capital historically averaged about $1 billion per year, and we added approximately $200 million with the consolidation of DCP Midstream. Despite the additional sustaining capital requirements from DCP, we reduced our sustaining capital spend to under $900 million in 2023. This $300 million benefit is also reflected in our 2024 capital plan. Through the end of 2023, we realized $630 million in cost reductions. The majority of these cost reductions relate to Refining, Operating and SG&A expenses as well as benefits to equity earnings and gross margin. On Slide 6, we provide more detail on the cost reductions at the total company level. Adjusted controllable costs were $8.4 billion in 2023 compared with $8.1 billion in 2022. The chart illustrates the main cost drivers year-over-year, including the impact of a full year of DCP consolidation. We continue to realize cost synergies from the DCP acquisition and subsequent integration. Our successful business transformation has already reduced costs, including our share of WRB costs, by approximately $500 million, and this work continues. Slide 7 provides a breakdown of Refining costs. Refining adjusted controllable costs, including turnaround expense and our proportionate share of WRB and MiRO controllable costs, decreased over $550 million to $5.2 billion in 2023. Business transformation savings reduced Refining costs by approximately $300 million. Additionally, lower turnaround expense and market impacts, primarily from lower utility prices, further reduced costs. These cost reductions more than offset inflationary impacts. On a dollar per barrel basis, adjusted controllable costs were $7.56 or $6.57 per barrel, excluding turnaround expense. This is a fully burdened cost that includes about $1 per barrel for Refining's share of corporate allocations and SG&A expenses. The business transformation savings reduced our 2023 adjusted costs by over $0.40 per barrel. We expect to achieve our full $1 per barrel run rate target by the end of 2024. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation. Slide 8 summarizes our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $3.09 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, including cash distributions from equity affiliates of $226 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $634 million. We distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders through $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $457 million of dividends. Net debt-to-capital ratio was 34% at year-end 2023, and return on capital employed was 16% for the year. Slide 9 highlights the change in results by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $708 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Marketing and Specialties, partially offset by improved results in Midstream. In Midstream, fourth quarter adjusted pretax income of $754 million was a record, up $185 million from the prior quarter, reflecting improvements in both NGL and transportation. The NGL business increased primarily due to higher margins and record volumes at the Sweeny Hub as well as lower operating costs. Transportation results were also higher, mainly reflecting the recognition of deferred revenue related to throughput and deficiency agreements. Chemicals adjusted pretax income increased $2 million to $106 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was mainly due to higher margins, mostly offset by lower equity earnings from CPChem's affiliates and decreased sales volumes from lower seasonal demand. Global O&P utilization was 94%. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $797 million, down $943 million from the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins. Realized margins decreased due to lower market crack spreads, partially offset by inventory hedge impacts, higher Gulf Coast clean product realizations, wider heavy crude discounts and strong commercial results. Market capture increased from 66% to 107%. Marketing and Specialties adjusted fourth quarter pretax income was $432 million, a decrease of $201 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to a seasonal decline in domestic wholesale fuel margins, primarily in the Mid-Continent. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23%. Slide 10 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter. We started the quarter with a $3.5 billion cash balance. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $2 billion. There was a working capital benefit of $207 million, mainly reflecting a reduction in inventory that was mostly offset by movements in accounts receivables and payables, which included the impact of declining commodity prices. We funded $634 million of capital spending and repaid approximately $100 million of debt. Additionally, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was $3.3 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s and turnaround expense to be between $110 million and $130 million. Our turnaround expense guidance excludes costs associated with the conversion and start-up of the Rodeo renewable fuels facility. At our San Francisco refinery, we are executing the Rodeo Renewed project. The facility operated as a crude oil refinery in January, and we will shut down crude operations in February as we were prepared to start up renewable fuels production by the end of the quarter. We anticipate $100 million of decommissioning and start-up costs in the first quarter. We anticipate first quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $290 million and $310 million. Full year guidance for 2024 is provided on Slide 11 of this presentation. Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.', 'Ryan M. Todd', 'Maybe starting out on margin, very strong margin capture in the quarter. Can you -- I know you talked about some of the things, but can you talk about some of the underlying drivers of that performance on the quarter? What might be seasonal or transient and maybe what you would highlight that might be more sustainable going forward in terms of improved performance?', 'Kevin J. Mitchell', ""Yes. Ryan, it's Kevin. Let me make some additional comments around that. So a few different drivers to the strong market capture. You'll recall back in the third quarter, we talked about some inventory hedge impacts that were a negative $100 million to $150 million and that we expected that to reverse in the fourth quarter. And that is, in fact, what happened. And so you had that benefit, which is a circa close to $300 million swing quarter-over-quarter. We also had improved feedstock, especially in the Central Corridor on Canadian crude differentials, and obviously, that's really a market-driven item. In the Gulf Coast, we had benefit from product pricing because of the effect on -- sort of lagged effect on product pricing for barrels going up Colonial. And so that, again, is a bit of a market-driven factor. So that item was a bit of a headwind in the third quarter. It was a tailwind in the fourth quarter. And what will happen in the first quarter is going to be dependent on where prices end the quarter at. But we also had strong commercial results, and this is the result of really being able to take advantage of market opportunities as they present themselves to us. So we were able to capture strong pipeline arbitrage and the commercial optimization around that as we optimized those barrels. So it's a bit of a combination of there are certain things that you would say were unique to the market dynamics in the quarter, but some of it is a function of strong operations, strong commercial execution by that organization."", 'Ryan M. Todd', 'Great. That was helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on Rodeo. I appreciate the update that you gave there in terms of some of the time line that we can expect over the next couple of months. As we think about start-up of the renewable diesel plant, can you maybe walk through what you would expect in terms of the first 3 to 6 months of operation there in terms of how long does it take to ramp to full operating capacity? How long does it take the PTU to get up and running? Maybe some of those things in terms of where we go from end of this quarter until you have kind of a full run rate there.', 'Richard G. Harbison', ""Yes. Ryan, this is Rich. I'll take that question here, kick it off, and maybe somebody will fill in for some additional color here. But the way we see the project progression at this point is, as Kevin mentioned in his points, that in February, we're going to shut down the facility. And that will allow us then to tie in the common utilities for one of our hydrocrackers, which is currently in the conversion process. We expect that to start up in March time frame, which will quickly ramp up to about 50% of the stated capacity of the Rodeo Renewed project. In April, we'll finish up the PTU and continue the conversion of the second reactor hydrocracker system and finish that up in April and then start the commissioning process, which will roll into the May time frame, and then we'll continue to optimize performance up. And we expect to be up to full rates by the end of the second quarter would be the ramp period for that. Does that answer your question there, Ryan? Or..."", 'Ryan M. Todd', 'Yes, that was great.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS.', 'Manav Gupta', ""Congrats on a very strong quarter and a strong start to the year. It looks like everything is coming together. I just quickly want to focus on the NGL part of the Midstream business. There were some concerns that DCP synergies will be delayed or there's some degradation of earnings. I think you have silenced a lot of critics over there with this earnings release, but help us walk through the sequential improvement we saw in the NGL business in the fourth quarter."", 'Mark E. Lashier', ""Yes, Manav. Thanks for your comments. I'm just going to make some high-level comments and then turn it over to Tim, but I appreciate you recognizing that we are delivering on the integration. The integration has been a success. The DCP team is fully integrated into Phillips 66 and performing seamlessly. And we're seeing great, really, synergies across the whole value chain that, even down at the level of communications, things happening quicker, things have -- better decisions being made faster, and it's really been something to behold. As we noted in the comments, we did hit $250 million of synergies captured, and we've got line of sight on another -- or getting that up to $400 million-plus. And Tim and his team are hard at work, so I'll let him give you some more color on that."", 'Timothy D. Roberts', ""Great. Thanks, Mark. Yes, Manav, a couple of things. I mean, really, it's pretty simple. When you put the 2 -- with the transaction, you put the 2 businesses together, we had improved volumes. Costs were down. We executed well operationally. We executed well commercially. And then ultimately, what that does is allow you to deliver results. And we felt this was more representative of what we're going to see in this business going forward. It really does highlight the strong earnings and free cash flow generation of the Midstream segment. Now that doesn't all happen by accident. It's been a bit of a slog as we've slowly got those folks integrated. We're almost done with the integration completely. We should be done sometime here early in the second quarter once we get all the ERP and IT systems all under 1 versus still running 2 in parallel. So we expect to see some additional costs come off. But really, it's just what I call blocking and tackling. The market hasn't been overly helpful, so we've had to make do with what we can in this environment. And I think, like you said, you operate it well and you commercially execute well, you give yourself a chance. And I think this is representative of that. So overall, we like the transaction, and we like where it's going. And we think it's getting itself positioned well to go out and compete."", 'Manav Gupta', ""Perfect. My quick follow-up is you always have a very informed view of the Refining macro. Help us understand within your system what you're seeing in terms of gasoline, diesel and even jet fuel demand out there."", 'Brian M. Mandell', ""Hi, Manav, it's Brian. I'll take that one. Global gasoline demand finished last year about 3% over prior year. We saw about 1% in the U.S. We expect 2024 global gasoline to grow almost 1%, and we're expecting U.S. to remain flat. Gasoline inventories continue at the high end of the 5-year average for both U.S. and Europe. We think the majority of the stored gasoline is winter-grade, particularly given the current strong octane values. Overall, gasoline stocks, we think, should move back to the middle of the 5-year range with spring turnarounds as we move toward the summer. On the distillate side, distillate demand finished 2023 about 2% over 2022. And the U.S. was actually down 2%, mostly in the West Coast, due to rains and the renewable diesel production and imports. Latin America, we saw up 2%. We expect a 2024 global distillate demand to grow about 0.5% and the U.S. 2%, given the U.S. is a stronger economy. And U.S. distillate stocks are about 14% below 5-year average. And we'd anticipate draws through the spring maintenance season that should take inventories even closer to last year's levels. And finally, on jet demand, finished last year 17% over prior year, with a total seat count recovering to 2019. 2024 global jet demand is expected to grow about 6%, with continued recovery on international travel. And we've seen cargo flights remain elevated, and we think that will continue in 2024 as well."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.', 'Douglas George Blyth Leggate', ""Gents, I wonder if I could ask you about the EBITDA number for 2023, the $12.7 billion you mentioned. If you rebase that to mid-cycle, where are we relative to the $14 billion target? It seems to us you've only got a year to go basically to do a very small amount of incremental cost cutting. It seems you may have some upside to those numbers. So if you could help us rebase that, that would be really helpful. That's my first question."", 'Kevin J. Mitchell', ""Yes, Doug, it's Kevin. Let me try and fill in the gaps on that one for you. There's really -- there's a couple of items that are probably a bit more significant in terms of the shift from current to what's 2025 mid-cycle, the $14 billion target. So for one, remember, the $14 billion is mid-cycle. The Chemicals business is not at mid-cycle currently, and that's about an incremental $1 billion to get to mid-cycle. And then on a mid-cycle basis, there's an increment of about $200 million from the mid-cap projects that they have just put into place, most of which took -- happened towards the end of last year. And so an incremental $1 billion in Chemicals really driven by the overall environment. Rodeo is not reflected in current, and that's a $700 million mid-cycle impact. And so that's a -- between those 2, you're at getting close to $2 billion of increment. There is still to come. There is some additional on the cost side of things. And there's Midstream at -- well, we're close to our mid-cycle on a run rate basis. Remember, the $12.7 billion only had our current ownership of DCP since June of last year, so there's that incremental step-up from an adjusted basis in that respect. In addition, we talked about the $600 million of additional commercial contribution to the business. We expect to see that materialize over the next 2 years. And we're also executing on the Refining projects that Rich has talked about in the past. And so those are the items that are going to get us to that $14 billion 2025 mid-cycle level."", 'Douglas George Blyth Leggate', ""That's very, very granular and much appreciated. Thanks, Kevin. My follow-up is kind of a -- is a question on Rodeo, but a different question perhaps than you normally get. We're trying to understand what the West Coast would look like if we rebased your capture rate, your historical relationship with realized margins versus indicators if Rodeo was not in the system. So I guess it's kind of a request and a question at the same time. To the extent you can give us the history ex Rodeo, that would be really helpful. But order of magnitude, was Rodeo loss-making for most of the last several years? Or how would you characterize the EBITDA contribution? And I'll leave it there."", 'Kevin J. Mitchell', ""Yes, Doug, it's -- understand the request and why you would want that. And we'll take that under consideration as we think about how we're going to report the go-forward Rodeo as a renewable fuels facility because we do want -- we also want to be able to demonstrate that, that asset, as a renewable fuels facility, is generating the kind of financial results that we've been talking about. And so we'll take that under consideration in terms of what we show from a recast basis. I think the question on what Rodeo has done in the past, it's really been a function of the market environment. I mean, it has been challenged over the last few years as what was historically a very strong crude advantage. So it disappeared with the declining supplies of domestic feedstocks for this facility and having to rely more on imported barrels. But then you're also -- it's a high-cost area, as you know. So it's -- although that's typical, that's all of California is that way. And then you're into what the market environment looks like. And so what we've typically seen in California is when there's operating upsets and supply is impacted, then you see an increase in margins and the financials look respectable. But when everything is running well, it's more challenged."", 'Douglas George Blyth Leggate', ""Thanks very much indeed, Kevin. We'll look forward to that."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of John Royall with JPMorgan.', 'John Macalister Royall', ""So my first question is on the balance sheet. You guys had guided to hitting the top end of your leverage range by year-end '23. You're finishing a bit above that, which, I think, was just driven by the working capital impact of falling prices. So assuming a somewhat stable environment for working capital and price in '24, do you have any updated guidance on when you think you'll get back into that range?"", 'Kevin J. Mitchell', ""Yes, John, it's -- you're right that the working capital tailwind that we expected to see for a variety of reasons didn't quite materialize the way we thought they would. And that probably impacted us by 2 to 3 percentage points on the net debt-to-capital metric. We expect to make some modest progress on debt reduction in 2024. We have a total of $1.1 billion of maturities in '24 at the Phillips 66 level. And so that gives us some flexibility in terms of how we manage this.I will say, though, that the working capital component is always a little bit of a wildcard because it can swing us to the tune of a couple of billion dollars over the course of a quarter, and that has an impact on the stated metric. So I think what I'd say is, look, we still target the 25% to 30% range. But when you step back and look in aggregate terms, we're very comfortable with where we are. And our capital allocation decisions are going to be made with consideration of all the different priorities that we've got out there, of which the balance sheet and debt is one of them. So I don't want to commit to any sort of rash decisions just to target that 1 particular metric. We want to make sure we make the right overall decisions, factoring in all of the different priorities."", 'John Macalister Royall', ""Understood. And my next question is just on the turnaround guide for the year. You took a pretty big year in '22 or a very big year in '22, which, I think, was somewhat of a catch-up year. Last year was a pretty meaningful step-down, and the guidance looks like '24 is basically same ballpark as '23. So should we think of the average -- an average turnaround year from here as being somewhere in that kind of $600 million range? And does the Rodeo conversion change that at all?"", 'Richard G. Harbison', ""John, I'll take that. This is Rich. Yes, I think that the range that we're at last year and this year is what you would consider an average year for us. And the outlook for this year stays in that. Like most companies, we do concentrate our planned maintenance activity in the first and fourth quarters in our system in any given year. And we tend to lighten those during the driving season, second and third quarter of the year. But the way our turnarounds are working on a huge effort by the organization, which I need to compliment them, is to really flatten out these heavy peak periods in our turnaround cycles. Now we will occasionally get a couple of sites that get stacked up on ourselves. But what we've really tried to do is push those out, level out the spend on a long-term basis and work towards this $500 million to $600 million range as our average turnaround cycle. So there'll be a few years that it'll be a little bit higher than that, and then there'll be some that may be slightly under that as well. But in a general sense, that's a good number to use."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.', 'Paul Cheng', ""Maybe the first one is for Kevin. Kevin, can you tell us that what's in the fourth quarter, what that was running at and what is the cost associated with that? And in the first quarter, the $100 million of decommission and -- decommission expense, I suppose that's going to run through and not being treated as a special item?"", 'Kevin J. Mitchell', 'So Paul, what was the first part of the question? I missed that first piece.', 'Paul Cheng', ""We're trying to understand that without Rodeo, what is the throughput run rate in the fourth quarter? And what is the cost, actually, yes -- or that if you can tell us that what is the Rodeo cost in the fourth quarter, and what is the run rate also?"", 'Mark E. Lashier', 'So Rodeo performance in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter.', 'Kevin J. Mitchell', ""So we -- I mean, we don't give out that sort of asset-specific level of financial information. What I can say is that the -- when you look at the fourth quarter results and the capture rates, the Rodeo starting to turn operations down, we shut down one of the crude units in the fourth quarter. That did have a detrimental impact to our fourth quarter results versus if we were just carrying on in the traditional normal full crude operations at Rodeo. So it did have an impact.In terms of the $100 million of start-up and decommissioning costs in the first quarter, we would not treat those as a special item. They will flow through as GAAP earnings or impact, and that will be how we report the results. Because they're not -- I mean, it's normal for what we're doing. It's not a unique factor. Now we can talk about it, and you can choose to make your own sort of adjustments around it. But for us, it will just be part of our normal operating results."", 'Paul Cheng', ""All right. And Kevin, if I look at on your Page 23 on your presentation, in terms of the margin capture, the other column, you're talking about $7.11. And in here that you have, they call it $200 million of, I think, the swing benefit from the Colonial Pipeline product pricing. So that's translating to about $3.90. So where is the other, say, $3 per barrel contributor there?"", 'Kevin J. Mitchell', ""Yes. So I think the bulk of the rest, so that's 1 factor on that. You've also got the swing I mentioned on the Gulf Coast product pricing effect. You had a swing there from 1 quarter to the next. And you also have the benefit in there of our -- we talked about our commercial performance during the quarter. That will also show up in that bar. So all those things get reflected in that part of the representation."", 'Paul Cheng', ""So I suppose that the bulk of the gap, say, $3 is contributed by commercial operation? Or that is just a minor piece of that, you have other things that's even a bigger contributor?"", 'Kevin J. Mitchell', ""Yes. I mean, it's a combination of all of those items. So you see benefit on the product side. You see benefit from commercial contribution. You see the benefit from the inventory hedging items that we talked about. So they all combine to make up the bulk of that $7."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.', 'Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair', ""On the Chem side, you provided strong utilization guidance once again for Q1. Could you talk about the recent improvement in PE prices? What's driving that? And then also, could you share any trends on demand that you're seeing, either export-related or domestic?"", 'Timothy D. Roberts', ""Yes. Matt, this is Tim. Yes, a couple of things on that from the Chem standpoint. Yes, we've seen actually pretty good stability with regard to polyethylene prices through the fourth quarter. Things were relatively flat from October through December, then they got a $0.05 increase in January. How much of the $0.05 they actually get, I think that might be a little bit of a discussion point. But nonetheless, it did highlight that the U.S. is running hard. Demand in the U.S. has been good, albeit steady in Europe, soft in Asia. The feedstock advantage here is, really, you've got a highly utilized U.S. Gulf Coast kit, namely CPChem, and they're running hard. So you've seen some destocking that's going on as well. So I think that's helped underpin a little bit of momentum. Now I don't think anybody's declaring victory on this at this point. I think there's a lot of destocking that still needs to happen throughout the balance of the year. But it does tell you that the market forces are in play, and you will see a rebalancing through 2024."", 'Mark E. Lashier', ""Yes. And Matthew, I think this just demonstrates the resilience of CPChem across this down cycle. They've done relatively well, been able to run at high rates and compete and be cash positive and show bottom-of-the-cycle returns that we're happy with. We're anxious to see them come out of this cyclical downturn, but they are really, really well positioned for the long term."", 'Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair', ""Sounds good. And then could you provide an outlook on your deferred taxes for 2024? It's been a little volatile recently, but I believe that 2023 did come in above your overall expectations. So what's the outlook for 2024?"", 'Kevin J. Mitchell', ""Yes, Matt, it's a great question. We had pretty strong deferred tax benefit in 2023 and also 2022. And in both years, the primary driver to those were the MLP roll-up. So in 2022, we had benefit associated with PSXP, then in 2023 with the DCP roll-up. And that, in the end, that was a bigger benefit than we were anticipating, which drove some of the movements in that, that you saw last year.That benefit drops off significantly as we go into 2024, and it's a combination of less -- lower capital spend and so less depreciation to take advantage of. And bonus depreciation is scaling down as well. So we dropped 60% year 1 bonus in 2024. So we're anticipating about a $200 million benefit for the year in 2024, so quite a lot lower than what we had in 2023.There is 1 caveat on this in that there's a current bill in Congress that, if ultimately passed, will extend some of the tax provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that, right now, we're in the process of starting to sunset out. And if that passes, we'll actually see 100% bonus depreciation backdated to 2023. So you'd get 2023, 2024, and 2025 all at 100%. That would benefit us in 2024 and to the tune of probably an incremental $300 million or so, but that's contingent on that legislation passing."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.', 'Jason Daniel Gabelman', ""I had a follow-up question on the Rodeo start-up plan, and I appreciate all the color. I know you mentioned it was going to be ramping up to full rates by midyear. Does that also include indicative feed slate, meaning you're going to be running kind of dirty lower CI feed from the middle of the year? Or is that going to be more of a ramp-up once you hit full rates?"", 'Richard G. Harbison', ""Yes, Jason, this is Rich. We'll start off with the easier feedstocks, generally, and those are used vegetable oils, maybe some used cooking oils and some meat vegetable oils. As we get the pretreatment unit up and running and lined out, we will start introducing lower and lower CI, carbon-intensive feedstocks, which includes the fats, the greases, the tallows, those types of feedstocks.And we fully expect those to be introduced into the system towards the second half of the second quarter, maybe into the third quarter. And we'll slowly and continuously reduce that carbon intensity feedstock quality as we get more and more comfortable with the operation of the pretreatment unit and their impacts inside the processing units as well. And I think our commercial organization is lined up with that theme. And they've been out and about gathering up these feedstocks and actively developing the aggregation facilities. And so they're positioning quite well for the -- looking for the green light from the Rodeo team to go ahead and start sending these in that direction, and they'll be ready when we're ready."", 'Jason Daniel Gabelman', ""Got it. And then my follow-up is on the Midstream segment and, clearly, very strong results as you've discussed on the call. But I'm wondering if there's any seasonality we should think about to the business that would result in maybe stronger winter results and weaker summer results, thinking of things like higher propane demand and butane being pulled out of storage for blending. And anything else that would be included like that, that would drive kind of lower earnings 2Q and 3Q relative to 4Q and 1Q."", 'Timothy D. Roberts', ""Yes, Jason, that's a great question and know that's how we would look at it. If I look at 2024, as you kind of think about what we see that IBT looking like, we think that looks somewhere around, on average, again, simple average across the 4 quarters, about [6 75] a quarter. But you're right, there's some seasonality that comes into play. Typically, it's a little stronger in the fourth quarter. Again, you nailed it. Propane, butane, all those things kind of come into play. You see a little bit of that still in the first quarter.So again, first quarter, fourth quarter, a little bit stronger. And then -- and it comes off a little bit. But on average, about 6 75 is what we're looking at. Now that's at mid-cycle. So I want to be real clear there. At mid-cycle commodity pricing, that's the framework we're operating under. Now obviously, if you look at first quarter, if there are winter events and things that happen that -- remember a couple of years ago that we had, that's a different game, too. We'll have to -- we just deal with that when that occurs. But generally, that's kind of framework we're looking at, again, on an IBT basis."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays.', 'Theresa Chen', 'Hi. In terms of your longer NGL wellhead-to-market strategy, can you just remind us, on a run rate basis, what do you anticipate is the breakdown of Y-grade volumes you control from your own processing plants flowing to your downstream assets versus third party?', 'Timothy D. Roberts', ""Well, I won't go into a lot of detail on that, Theresa. But what I will tell you is we're long. We are long on NGLs. But actually, we want to be, and that's by design. We offload to third parties to run some of our product for us, whether they're to transport or whether to frac. And at some point, I'd like to think over time as we continue to build scale on the integrated value chain that we've got, we'll bringing those volumes in-house. But at this point in time, like I said, we're long and we are for the foreseeable future on NGLs."", 'Theresa Chen', 'Got it. And would you mind giving us an update on the progress with the asset sales? How far are you along this process? And have you narrowed things down further?', 'Mark E. Lashier', ""Yes. As far as asset sales go, as we said before that everything we have has a value. And we understand what that value is, and that's what we're focused on. If we can capture more value from someone else owning assets, then we'll do that. But having said that, we are in some active discussions as we speak. There's a number of processes underway that we can't comment on. But all I'd say is leave it there so that we'll have more comments likely at our first quarter earnings call."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joe Laetsch with Morgan Stanley.', 'Joseph Gregory Laetsch', 'Congrats on a good quarter. So I wanted to ask on cracks in the Central Corridor, particularly on the gasoline side, which have remained weak to start the year. I know you benefit from running WCS there, but I was just hoping to get your latest thoughts on Mid-Con dynamics and kind of watching there as the year progresses.', 'Brian M. Mandell', ""Yes, particularly in Chicago, where the crack is now close to 0, a number of factors have caused that weak ethylene margins. Demand has been poor due to winter weather, which affected production -- demand more than production. Refinings have been running strongly there. And then the upper Illinois River was frozen for 10 days, which blocked our Mid-Con or Chicago exports from getting to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So kind of our view there is Chicago refineries are soon going to be in turnaround, and there's a closed from the U.S. Gulf Coast up north. We think things will clear up, particularly as winter-grade gasoline has moved out of tank and the market switches to summer-grade gasoline."", 'Joseph Gregory Laetsch', 'Great. And then I just wanted to ask on the export side. Have you seen a shift in any crude or product flows with the Panama Canal capacity limitations? Or any Suez Canal diversions, maybe shipping more product to Europe?', 'Brian M. Mandell', ""I would say, first, with Russia, now with the Red Sea, we have been seeing different arbitrage, different places. As you know, Russian barrels are going different places than they used to. But by and large, it's just increasing freight rates and time. For us, that's actually helpful because as it does that, the European-type barrels, the Brent TIs, widen out, and we buy more barrels on basis WTI. So for us, it's a benefit. Also, we have a strong and robust bunker fueling business, which also benefits from the higher bunker sales for the longer voyages."", 'Operator', ""This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn it back to Mark for closing remarks."", 'Mark E. Lashier', ""Thanks for all your questions. I'm going to wrap up with Slide 13 and have some comments about where we've been and where we're headed.

Then in 2023, we focused on what we control, and we delivered on our plans with strong operating and financial results.

In 2023, our total shareholder return was 33%, and we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%.', ""Today, we're going to cover a few major items, including the reasons why Phillips 66 is an attractive investment opportunity, and we'll highlight the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Next, we'll discuss our fourth-quarter financial results, then we look forward to your questions. On Slide 3, we summarize the attributes that make us a differentiated and attractive value proposition. Our diversified and integrated portfolio delivered strong returns on capital employed and a high payout ratio supported by dividend growth."", ""We're on a path to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by 40% to $14 billion by 2025. In addition, 75% of this growth will be outside of Refining. We expect this growth and more stable cash flow to support our valuation going forward and contribute to attractive total shareholder returns. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation across our portfolio has contributed to an average return on capital employed of 13% since our formation in 2012, almost double our cost of capital."", ""We're committed to financial flexibility, and our strong investment-grade credit rating remains differentiated relative to our peers. We expect to return in excess of 50% of our growing operating cash flow to shareholders. All of these attributes will support a secure, competitive and growing dividend, strong share repurchases as well as debt reduction at mid-cycle margins. Slide 4 summarizes our achievements to date on our strategic priorities."", ""On our last call, we raised our targets and continued to successfully execute our plan to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA and grow shareholder distributions. Since July of 2022, we've distributed $8.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends. We're on track to achieve our $13 billion to $15 billion target by the end of 2024. The execution of our plan to enhance Refining operating performance has resulted in crude utilization rates above the industry average for four consecutive quarters."", 'In fact, we operated at our highest annual rate since 2019. We remain focused on improving performance, increasing market capture, and reducing costs to enhance our earnings per barrel. In Midstream, our NGL wellhead-to-market business continues to exceed our expectations. The team has done a remarkable job of integrating DCP Midstream and captured run rate synergies of $250 million as of year-end.', ""And we expect over $400 million of synergies by 2025. Since increasing our ownership of DCP, the Midstream annual run rate for adjusted EBITDA has been $3.6 billion. The stable cash generation from our Midstream business has grown to a level that covers the company's top capital priorities, funding sustaining capital and the dividend. We're delivering on business transformation targets and remain laser-focused on further reducing our cost structure in 2024."", 'Kevin will be providing more details. In addition, we plan to monetize assets that no longer fit our long-term strategy. These asset dispositions are expected to generate over $3 billion in proceeds that will support our strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders. Timing of these dispositions will be subject to satisfactory market conditions and any necessary regulatory approvals.', ""Our total adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $12.7 billion, reflecting above mid-cycle margins in Refining and nearly $6 billion contributed by our more stable Midstream and Marketing and Specialties businesses. We're focused on disciplined capital allocation, only funding attractive high-return projects across our portfolio. The Rodeo Renewed project to convert our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities is expected to generate strong returns. The project is progressing well and we expect to start up later this quarter."", ""Looking forward, we're well-positioned to achieve our targets by capitalizing on the strengths of our diversified and integrated portfolio. We'll do this through continued operating and commercial excellence to deliver significant shareholder value through the economic cycles as demonstrated by our total shareholder return of 33% in 2023. Our commitment to a secure, competitive, and growing dividend has resulted in a 16% compound annual growth rate since 2012.

Kevin, over to you.', 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Mark. I'll start on Slide 5 with an update on our business transformation progress and how we are reducing costs to sustain higher cash generation. We achieved $1.2 billion in run rate savings as of year-end 2023, comprised of $900 million of cost reductions and $300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. Sustaining capital is one of our business transformation success stories."", 'Our sustaining capital historically averaged about $1 billion per year, and we added approximately $200 million with the consolidation of DCP Midstream. Despite the additional sustaining capital requirements from DCP, we reduced our sustaining capital spend to under $900 million in 2023. This $300 million benefit is also reflected in our 2024 capital plan. Through the end of 2023, we realized $630 million in cost reductions.', 'The majority of these cost reductions relate to Refining, Operating, and SG&A expenses as well as benefits to equity earnings and gross margin. On Slide 6, we provide more detail on the cost reductions at the total company level. Adjusted controllable costs were $8.4 billion in 2023, compared with $8.1 billion in 2022. The chart illustrates the main cost drivers year over year including the impact of a full year of DCP consolidation.', 'We continue to realize cost synergies from the DCP acquisition and subsequent integration. Our successful business transformation has already reduced costs, including our share of WRB costs by approximately $500 million, and this work continues. Slide 7 provides a breakdown of Refining costs. Refining adjusted controllable costs, including turnaround expense and our proportionate share of WRB and MiRO controllable costs, decreased over $550 million to $5.2 billion in 2023.', 'Business transformation savings reduced refining costs by approximately $300 million. Additionally, lower turnaround expense and market impacts primarily from lower utility prices further reduced costs. These cost reductions more than offset inflationary impacts. On a dollar-per-barrel basis, adjusted controllable costs were $7.56 or $6.57 per barrel, excluding turnaround expense.', ""This is a fully burdened cost that includes about $1 per barrel for Refining's share of corporate allocations and SG&A expenses. The business transformation savings reduced our 2023 adjusted costs by over $0.40 per barrel. We expect to achieve our full $1 per barrel run rate target by the end of 2024. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation."", 'Slide 8 summarizes our fourth-quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $3.09 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, including cash distributions from equity affiliates of $226 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $634 million.', 'We distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders through $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $457 million of dividends. Net debt to capital ratio was 34% at year-end 2023, and return on capital employed was 16% for the year. Slide 9 highlights the change in results by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $708 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Marketing and Specialties, partially offset by improved results in Midstream.', 'In Midstream, fourth-quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $754 million was a record, up $185 million from the prior quarter, reflecting improvements in both NGL and transportation. The NGL business increased primarily due to higher margins and record volumes at the Sweeny Hub as well as lower operating costs. Transportation results were also higher, mainly reflecting the recognition of deferred revenue related to throughput and deficiency agreements. Chemicals adjusted pre-tax income increased $2 million to $106 million in the fourth quarter.', ""This increase was mainly due to higher margins, mostly offset by lower equity earnings from CPChem's affiliates and decreased sales volumes from lower seasonal demand. Global O&P utilization was 94%. Refining fourth-quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $797 million, down $943 million from the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins."", 'Realized margins decreased due to lower market crack spreads, partially offset by inventory hedge impacts, higher Gulf Coast clean product realizations, wider heavy crude discounts, and strong commercial results. Market capture increased from 66% to 107%. Marketing and Specialties adjusted fourth-quarter pre-tax income was $432 million, a decrease of $201 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to a seasonal decline in domestic wholesale fuel margins, primarily in the Mid-Continent.', 'Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23%. Slide 10 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter. We started the quarter with a $3.5 billion cash balance. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $2 billion.', 'There was a working capital benefit of $207 million, mainly reflecting a reduction in inventory that was mostly offset by movements in accounts receivables and payables, which include the impact of declining commodity prices. We funded $634 million of capital spending and repaid approximately $100 million of debt. Additionally, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was $3.3 billion.', ""This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s and turnaround expense to be between $110 million and $130 million."", 'Our turnaround expense guidance excludes costs associated with the conversion and start-up of the Rodeo Renewable fuels facility.

Can you -- I know you talked about some of the things, but can you talk about some of the underlying drivers of that performance on the quarter? What might be seasonal or transient and maybe what you would highlight that might be more sustainable going forward in terms of improved performance?', 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Ryan, it's Kevin. Let me make some additional comments around that. So a few different drivers to the strong market capture."", ""You'll recall back in the third quarter, we talked about some inventory hedge impacts that were a negative $100 million to $150 million and that we expected that to reverse in the fourth quarter. And that is, in fact, what happened. And so you had that benefit, which is a circa close to $300 million swing quarter over quarter. We also had improved feedstock, especially in the central corridor on Canadian crude differentials, and obviously, that's really a market-driven item."", 'In the Gulf Coast, we had benefit from product pricing because of the effect on -- sort of lagged effect on product pricing for barrels going up colonial. And so that, again, is a bit of a market-driven factor. So that item was a bit of a headwind in the third quarter. It was a tailwind in the fourth quarter, and what will happen in the first quarter is going to be dependent on where prices end the quarter at.', ""But we also had strong commercial results, and this is a result of really being able to take advantage of market opportunities as they present themselves to us. So we were able to capture strong pipeline arbitrage and the commercial optimization around that as we optimized those barrels. So it's a bit of a combination of there are certain things that you would say were unique to the market dynamics in the quarter, but some of it is a function of strong operations, strong commercial execution by that organization."", 'Ryan Todd -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you. That was helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on Rodeo.', 'I appreciate the update that you gave there in terms of some of the time line that we can expect over the next couple of months. As we think about start-up of the renewable diesel plant, can you maybe walk through what you would expect in terms of the first three to six months of operation there in terms of how long does it take to ramp to full operating capacity? How long does it take the PTU to get up and running? Maybe some of those things in terms of where we go from end of this quarter until you have kind of a full run rate there.', 'Rich Harbison -- Executive Vice President, Refining', ""Yeah. Ryan, this is Rich. I'll take that question here, kick it off and maybe somebody will fill in for some additional color here. But the way we see the project progression at this point is, as Kevin mentioned in his points, that in February, we're going to shut down the facility."", ""And that will allow us then to tie in the common utilities for one of our hydrocrackers, which is currently in the conversion process. We expect that to start up in March time frame, which will quickly ramp up to about 50% of the stated capacity of the Rodeo Renewed project. In April, we'll finish up the PTU and continue the conversion of the second reactor hydrocracker system and finish that up in April and then start the commissioning process, which will roll into the May time frame, and then we'll continue to optimize performance up. And we expect to be up to full rates by the end of the second quarter would be the ramp period for that."", 'Does that answer your question there, Ryan?', 'Ryan Todd -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Yeah. That was great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Please go ahead.', 'Manav Gupta -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Guys, congrats on a very strong quarter and a strong start to the year. Looks like everything is coming together. I just quickly want to focus on the NGL part of the Midstream business. There were some concerns that DCP synergies will be delayed or there's some degradation of earnings."", 'I think you have silenced a lot of critics over there with this earnings release, but help us walk through the sequential improvement we saw in the NGL business in the fourth quarter.', 'Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, Manav. Thanks for your comments. I'm just going to make some high-level comments and then turn it over to Tim, but I appreciate you recognizing that we are delivering on the integration. The integration has been a success."", ""The DCP team is fully integrated into Phillips 66 and performing seamlessly. And we're seeing great, really, synergies across the whole value chain that even down at the level of communications, things happening quicker, things have -- better decisions being made faster and it's really been something to behold. As we noted in the comments, we did hit $250 million of synergies captured, and we've got line of sight on another -- or getting that up to $400 million-plus. And Tim and his team are hard at work so I'll let him give you some more color on that."", 'Tim Roberts -- Executive Vice President, Midstream and Chemicals', ""All right. Thanks, Mark. Yes, Manav, a couple of things. I mean, really, it's pretty simple."", 'When you put the two -- the transaction, you put the two businesses together, we had improved volumes. Costs were down. We executed well operationally. We executed well commercially.', ""And then ultimately, what that does is allow you to deliver results, and we felt this was more representative of what we're going to see in this business going forward. It really does highlight the strong earnings and free cash flow generation of the Midstream segment. Now that doesn't all happen by accident. It's been a bit of a slog as we've slowly got those folks integrated."", ""We're almost done with the integration completely. We should be done sometime here early in the second quarter once we get all the ERP and IT systems all under one versus still running two in parallel. So we expect to see some additional costs come off. But really, it's just what I call blocking and tackling."", ""The market hasn't been overly helpful, so we've had to make do with what we can in this environment. And I think like I said, you operate well and you commercially execute well, you give yourself a chance. And I think this is representative of that. So overall, we like the transaction and we like where it's going, and we think it's getting itself positioned well to go out and compete."", 'Manav Gupta -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Perfect. My quick follow-up is you always have a very informed view of the Refining macro. Help us understand within your system what you're seeing in terms of gasoline, diesel, and even jet fuel demand out there."", 'Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial', ""Hi, Manav. It's Brian. I'll take that one. Global gasoline demand finished last year about 3% over prior year."", ""We saw about 1% in the U.S. We expect 2024 global gasoline to grow almost 1% and we're expecting U.S. to remain flat. Gasoline inventories continue at the high end of the five-year average for both U.S."", 'and Europe. We think the majority of the stored gasoline is winter-grade, particularly given the current strong octane values. Overall, gasoline stocks, we think, should move back to the middle of the five-year range with spring turnarounds as we move toward the summer. On the distillate side, distillate demand finished 2023 about 2% over 2022, and the U.S.', 'was actually down 2%, mostly in the West Coast due to rains and the renewable diesel production and imports. Latin America, we saw up 2%. We expect a 2024 global distillate demand to grow about 0.5% and the U.S. 2%, given the U.S.', ""is a stronger economy. And U.S. distillate stocks are about 14% below five-year average, and we'd anticipate draws through the spring maintenance season that should take inventories even closer to last year's levels. And finally on jet demand, finished last year 17% over prior year, with a total seat count recovering to 2019."", ""2024 global jet demand is expected to grow about 6% with continued recovery on international travel. And we've seen cargo flights remain elevated and we think that will continue in 2024 as well."", 'Manav Gupta -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Thank you so much, guys.', 'Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Manav.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug, please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Gents, I wonder if I could ask you about the EBITDA number for 2023, the $12.7 billion you mentioned. If you rebase that to mid-cycle, where are we relative to the $14 billion target? It seems to us you've only got a year to go basically to do a very small amount of incremental cost cutting."", ""It seems you may have some upside to those numbers. So if you could help us rebase that, that would be really helpful. That's my first question."", 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, Doug. It's Kevin. Let me try and fill in the gaps on that 1 for you. There's really -- there's a couple of items that are probably a bit more significant in terms of the shift from current to what's 2025 mid-cycle, the $14 billion target."", ""So for one, remember, the $14 billion is mid-cycle. The Chemicals business is not at mid-cycle currently, and that's about an incremental $1 billion to get to mid-cycle. And then on a mid-cycle basis, there's an increment of about $200 million from the mid-cap projects that they have just put into place, most of which took -- happened toward the end of last year. And so an incremental $1 billion in Chemicals really driven by the overall environment."", ""Rodeo is not reflected in current and that's a $700 million mid-cycle impact. And so that's a -- between those two, you're at getting close to $2 billion of increment that is still to come. There is some additional on the cost side of things. And there's Midstream at -- well, we're close to our mid-cycle on a run rate basis."", ""Remember, the $12.7 billion only had our current ownership of DCP since June of last year, so there's that incremental step-up from an adjusted basis in that respect. In addition, we talked about the $600 million of additional commercial contribution to the business. We expect to see that materialize over the next two years. And we're also executing on the Refining projects that Rich has talked about in the past."", 'And so those are the items that are going to get us to that $14 billion 2025 mid-cycle level.', 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""That's very, very granular and much appreciated. Thanks, Kevin. My follow-up is kind of a -- is a question on Rodeo but a different question perhaps than you normally get. We're trying to understand what the West Coast would look like if we rebased your capture rate, your historical relationship with realized margins versus indicators if Rodeo was not in the system."", ""So I guess it's kind of a request and a question at the same time. To the extent you can give us the history ex Rodeo, that would be really helpful. But order of magnitude, was Rodeo loss-making for most of the last several years or how would you characterize the EBITDA contribution? And I'll leave it there. Thank you."", 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, Doug. It's -- understand the request and why you would want that, and we'll take that under consideration as we think about how we're going to report the go-forward Rodeo as a renewable fuels facility because we do want -- we also want to be able to demonstrate that, that asset as a renewable fuels facility is generating the kind of financial results that we've been talking about. And so we'll take that under consideration in terms of what we show from a recast basis. I think the question on what Rodeo has done in the past, it's really been a function of the market environment."", ""I mean, it has been challenged over the last few years as what was historically a very strong crude advantage, so it disappeared with the declining supplies of domestic feedstocks for this facility and having to rely more on imported barrels. But then you're also -- it's a high-cost area, as you know. So it's -- although that's typical, that's all of California is that way. And then you're into what the market environment looks like."", ""And so what we've typically seen in California is when there's operating upsets and supply is impacted, then you see an increase in margins and the financials look respectable. But when everything is running well, it's more challenged."", 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Thanks very much indeed, Kevin. We'll look forward to that. Thanks."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of John Royall with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""All right. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on the balance sheet. You guys had guided to hitting the top end of your leverage range by year-end '23."", ""You're finishing a bit above that, which I think was just driven by the working capital impact of falling prices. So assuming a somewhat stable environment for working capital and price in '24, do you have any updated guidance on when you think you'll get back into that range?"", 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, John. It's -- you're right that the working capital tailwind that we expected to see for a variety of reasons didn't quite materialize the way we thought they would. And that probably impacted us by two to three percentage points on the net debt to capital metric. We expect to make some modest progress on debt reduction in 2024."", ""We have a total of $1.1 billion of maturities in '24 at the Phillips 66 level. And so that gives us some flexibility in terms of how we manage this. I will say, though, that the working capital component is always a little bit of a wildcard because it can swing us to the tune of a couple of billion dollars over the course of a quarter, and that has an impact on the stated metric. So I think what I'd say is, look, we still target the 25% to 30% range."", ""But when you step back and look in aggregate terms, we're very comfortable with where we are. And our capital allocation decisions are going to be made with consideration of all the different priorities that we've got out there, of which the balance sheet and debt is one of them. So I don't want to commit to any sort of rash decisions just to target that one particular metric. We want to make sure we make the right overall decisions, factoring in all of the different priorities."", 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Understood. Thanks, Kevin. And my next question is just on the turnaround guide for the year. You took a pretty big year in '22 or a very big year in '22, which I think was somewhat of a catch-up year."", ""Last year was a pretty meaningful step-down and the guidance looks like '24 is basically same ballpark as '23. So should we think of the average -- an average turnaround year from here as being somewhere in that kind of $600 million range? And does the Rodeo conversion change that at all?"", 'Rich Harbison -- Executive Vice President, Refining', ""John, I'll take that. This is Rich. Yes, I think that the range that we're at last year and this year is what you would consider an average year for us. And the outlook for this year stays in that."", 'Like most companies, we do concentrate our planned maintenance activity in the first and fourth quarters in our system in any given year. And we tend to lighten those during the driving season, second and third quarter of the year. But the way our turnarounds are working on a huge effort by the organization, which I need to compliment them, is to really flatten out these heavy peak periods in our turnaround cycles. Now we will occasionally get a couple of sites that get stacked up on ourselves.', ""But what we've really tried to do is push those out, level out the spend on a long-term basis and work toward this $500 million to $600 million range as our average turnaround cycle. So there'll be a few years that it'll be a little bit higher than that, and then there'll be some that may be slightly under that as well. But in a general sense, that's a good number to use."", 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead, Paul.', 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe the first one is for Kevin. Kevin, can you tell us that what's in the fourth quarter, what that was running at and what is the cost associated with that? And in the first quarter, the $100 million of the commission and the commission expense, I suppose that's going to run through and not being treated as a special item."", 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'So Paul, what was the first part of the question? I missed that first piece.', 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""We're trying to understand that with Rodeo, what is the throughput run rate in the fourth quarter? And what is the cost actually, yes, or that if you can tell us that, what is the Rodeo cost in the fourth quarter and what is the run rate also?"", 'Jeff Dietert -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'So Rodeo performance in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter?', 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""So we -- I mean, we don't give out that sort of asset-specific level of financial information. What I can say is that the -- when you look at the fourth-quarter results and the capture rates, the Rodeo starting to turn operations down, we shut down one of the crude units in the fourth quarter. That did have a detrimental impact to our fourth-quarter results versus if we were just carrying on in the traditional normal full crude operations at Rodeo. So it did have an impact."", ""In terms of the $100 million of start-up and decommissioning costs in the first quarter, we would not treat those as a special item. They will flow through as GAAP earnings or impact, and that will be how we report the results because they're not -- I mean, it's normal for what we're doing. It's not a unique factor now. We can talk about it and you can choose to make your own sort of adjustments around it, but for us, it will just be part of our normal operating results."", 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""All right. And Kevin, if I look at on your Page 23 on your presentation, in terms of the margin capture, the column, you're talking about $7.11 and in here that you have, they call it $200 million of, I think, the swing benefit from the Colonial pipeline product pricing. So that's translating to about $3.90. So where is the other, say, $3 per barrel contributor there?"", 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. So I think the bulk of the rest, so that's one factor on that. You've also got the swing I mentioned on the Gulf Coast product pricing effect. You had a swing there from one quarter to the next."", 'And you also have the benefit in there of our -- we talked about our commercial performance during the quarter. That will also show up in that bar. So all those things get reflected in that part of the representation.', 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""So I suppose that the bulk of the gap, say, $3 is contributed by commercial operation? Or that is just a minor piece of that, you have other things that's even a bigger contributor?"", 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I mean, it's a combination of all of those items. So you see benefit on the product side. You see benefit from commercial contribution."", 'You see the benefit from the inventory hedging items that we talked about. So they all combined to make up the bulk of that $7.', 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew, please go ahead.', 'Matthew Blair -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the Chem side, you provided strong utilization guidance once again for Q1.', ""Could you talk about the recent improvement in PE prices? What's driving that? And then also, could you share any trends on demand that you're seeing, either export-related or domestic?"", 'Tim Roberts -- Executive Vice President, Midstream and Chemicals', ""Yeah. Matt, this is Tim. Yes, a couple of things on that from the Chem standpoint. Yes, we've seen actually pretty good stability with regard to polyethylene prices through the fourth quarter."", 'Things were relatively flat from October through December, then they got a $0.05 increase in January. How much of the $0.05 they actually get, I think that might be a little bit of a discussion point. But nonetheless, it did highlight that the U.S. is running hard.', ""Demand in the U.S. has been good. Albeit steady in Europe, soft in Asia, the feedstock advantage here is really -- you've got a highly utilized U.S. Gulf Coast kit, namely CPChem, and they're running hard."", ""So you've seen some destocking that's going on as well. So I think that's helped underpin a little bit of momentum. Now I don't think anybody's declaring victory on this at this point. I think there's a lot of destocking that still needs to happen throughout the balance of the year."", 'But it does tell you that the market forces are in play, and you will see a rebalancing through 2024.', 'Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. And Matthew, I think this just demonstrates the resilience of CPChem across this down cycle. They've done relatively well, been able to run at high rates and compete and be cash positive and show bottom of the cycle returns that we're happy with. We're anxious to see them come out of this cyclical downturn, but they are really, really well-positioned for the long term."", 'Matthew Blair -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst', ""Sounds good. And then could you provide an outlook on your deferred taxes for 2024? It's been a little volatile recently, but I believe that 2023 did come in above your overall expectations. So what's the outlook for 2024?"", 'Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, Matt, it's a great question. We had pretty strong deferred tax benefit in 2023 and also 2022. And in both years, the primary driver to those were the MLP roll-up. So in 2022, we had benefit associated with PSXP, then in 2023 with the DCP roll-up."", ""And in the end, that was a bigger benefit than we were anticipating, which drove some of the movements in that, that you saw last year. That benefit drops off significantly as we go into 2024, and it's a combination of less lower capital spend and so less depreciation to take advantage of, and bonus depreciation is scaling down as well. So we dropped 60% year one bonus in 2024. So we're anticipating about a $200 million benefit for the year in 2024, so quite a lot lower than what we had in 2023."", ""There is one caveat on this in that there's a current bill in Congress that, if ultimately passed, will extend some of the tax provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that right now, we're in the process of starting to sunset out. And if that passes, we'll actually see 100% bonus depreciation backdated to 2023, so you'd get 2023, 2024, and 2025 all at 100%. That would benefit us in 2024 and to the tune of probably an incremental $300 million or so.

Thanks for taking my questions. I had a follow-up question on the Rodeo start-up plan, and I appreciate all the color. I know you mentioned it was going to be ramping up to full rates by midyear.', ""Does that also include indicative feed slate, meaning you're going to be running kind of dirty lower CI feed from the middle of the year, or is that going to be more of a ramp-up once you hit full rates?"", 'Rich Harbison -- Executive Vice President, Refining', ""Yes, Jason. This is Rich. We'll start off with the easier feedstocks generally, and those are used vegetable oils, maybe some used cooking oils and some meat vegetable oils. As we get the pretreatment unit up and running and lined out, we will start introducing lower and lower CI, carbon-intensive, feedstocks, which includes the fats, the greases, the tallows, those types of feedstocks, and we fully expect those to be introduced into the system toward the second half of the second quarter, maybe into the third quarter."", ""And we'll slowly and continuously reduce that carbon intensity feedstock quality as we get more and more comfortable with the operation of the pretreatment unit and their impacts inside the processing units as well. And I think our commercial organization is lined up with that team. And they've been out and about gathering up these feedstocks and actively developing the aggregation facilities. And so they're positioning quite well for the -- looking for the green light from the Rodeo team to go ahead and start sending these that direction and they'll be ready when we're ready."", 'Jason Gabelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then my follow-up is on the Midstream segment and clearly, very strong results as you've discussed on the call. But I'm wondering if there's any seasonality we should think about to the business that would result in maybe stronger winter results and weaker summer results, thinking of things like higher propane demand and butane being pulled out of storage for blending, and anything else that would be included like that, that would drive kind of lower earnings 2Q and 3Q relative to 4Q and 1Q. Thanks."", 'Tim Roberts -- Executive Vice President, Midstream and Chemicals', ""Yes, Jason. That's a great question, and that's how we would look at it. If I look at 2024, as you kind of think about what we see that IBT looking like, we think that looks somewhere around, on average, again, simple average across the four quarters, about 6/75 a quarter. But you're right, there's some seasonality that comes into play."", ""Typically, it's a little stronger in the fourth quarter. Again, you nailed it on propane, butane, all those things kind of come into play. You see a little bit of that still in the first quarter. So again, first quarter, fourth quarter, a little bit stronger and then -- and it comes off a little bit."", ""But on average, about 6/75 is what we're looking at. Now that's at mid-cycle. So I want to be real clear there. At mid-cycle commodity pricing, that's the framework we're operating under."", ""Now obviously, if you look at first quarter, if there are winter events and things that happen that remember a couple of years ago that we had, that's a different game, too. We'll have to -- we just deal with that when that occurs. But generally, that's kind of framework we're looking at, again, on an IBT basis."", 'Jason Gabelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'All right.

I know you benefit from running WCS there, but I was just hoping to get your latest thoughts on Mid-Con dynamics in watching there as the year progresses.', 'Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial', 'Yes, particularly in Chicago, where the crack is now close to zero, a number of factors have caused that weak ethylene margins. Demand has been poor due to winter weather, which affected production -- demand more than production. Refinings have been running strongly there. And then the upper Illinois River was frozen for 10 days, which blocked our Mid-Con or Chicago exports from getting to the U.S.', ""Gulf Coast. So kind of our view there is Chicago refineries are soon going to be in turnaround, and there's a closed from the U.S. Gulf Coast up north.

As you know, Russian barrels are going different places than they used to. But by and large, it's just increasing freight rates and time.

That's not to say this leading drugmaker hasn't had its share of issues. It has struggled with stiff competition for some of its products and slow revenue growth."", ""However, the market has faith in Amgen, as evidenced by its rising stock price. Is this faith justified? Let's determine whether buying shares of the biotech giant is worth it."", ""In the third quarter, Amgen's revenue increased by just 4% year over year to $6.9 billion. Older products, such as psoriasis arthritis treatment Otezla, are seeing their sales drop, while newer medicines, like cancer drug Lumakras, are failing to make a meaningful impact. But there is some hope for Amgen."", ""Last year, it acquired rare diseases-focused Horizon Therapeutics for about $28 billion in cash. Horizon has many exciting pipeline products and a key approved medicine called Tepezza that targets thyroid eye disease. Tepezza has only been approved since January 2020. Between Tepezza and Horizon Therapeutics' pipeline, Amgen hopes to find its next blockbuster."", ""The company isn't just relying on acquisitions for that purpose, though. Amgen has several promising candidates of its own. One of the more exciting is maridebart cafraglutide, a potential weight-loss therapy whose phase 2 results are due later this year. The anti-obesity market is projected to skyrocket in the coming years, so it's not surprising to see Amgen trying to dip its toes in these waters."", ""Amgen is also close to earning approvals for brand-new products. Last year, it submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for tarlatamab, a potential therapy for lung cancer. The agency set a PDUFA goal action date -- the date by which it will complete the review of Amgen's application -- of June 12."", ""Newer products will eventually allow Amgen to exit its top-line growth slump. The company will also count on Tezspire, an asthma medicine first approved in the U.S. in late 2021. Amgen developed this treatment in partnership with AstraZeneca. It isn't contributing significantly to Amgen's financial results yet. In the third quarter, Tezspire's revenue increased by almost 193% year over year to $161 million."", ""However, Tezspire is aiming for several label expansions that could help boost its sales. Elsewhere, Amgen is developing biosimilars for several blockbusters, including cancer drug Opdivo, eye medicine Eylea, and more. The prevalent opinion holds that drugs are too expensive in the U.S. That's why there is a massive market for companies looking to change that situation, and Amgen is looking to be a leader."", 'This represents yet another potentially lucrative opportunity for the biotech.', ""Amgen's financial results may not have been outstanding over the past couple of years, but it's not odd for drugmakers to go through such periods. The company is doing what it is supposed to do to turn things around: market new medicines, either developed internally or acquired from other biotechs. Amgen's underlying business remains solid and should continue supporting its dividend. The company currently offers a yield of 2.89%, higher than the S&P 500's average of 1.47%."", ""Amgen has increased its dividend by almost 269% in the past decade -- that's excellent. The biotech's cash payout ratio remains very reasonable at 47.5%. There is plenty of room for more dividend hikes."", ""Between Amgen's dividend and its robust underlying business that will benefit from important long-term trends (such as the world's aging population), the company is an excellent stock for low-risk, income-seeking investors.

160,2aca4445-0c86-3aa4-bef6-384e9a62c8c6,NEM,2024-02-01,7 Gold Stocks to Buy for Uncertain Economic Times,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-gold-stocks-buy-uncertain-210729519.html,1706216849,STORY,"['WPM', 'FNV', 'BHP', 'NEM', 'AEM']","['Inherently, the idea of gold stocks generates controversy in some circles because of its relevance – or lack thereof. Often labeled as a “barbarous relic,” the yellow metal is exactly that, a commodity. It has no distinction from other variants of the same element. And it neither produces no earnings nor pays dividends. Some might say it’s useless until something goes wrong.', 'If CNN is any barometer, then we’re skating on some thin geopolitical ice. As a recent article pointed out in its headline, “[t]he world is a mess and Wall Street isn’t paying attention.” Now, I wouldn’t say that the Street is ignoring the various flashpoints happening throughout the world. However, it’s oddly bullish despite the cacophony. Of course, this dynamic could change, thus warranting a closer look at gold stocks.', 'To be sure, we’re dealing mostly with mining-related enterprises. However, gold tends to benefit from the fear trade. And increased demand should be good for the mining ecosystem.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'On another level, if the Federal Reserve goes through with interest rate cuts, the dollar would likely continue its longstanding devaluation. And that should also benefit precious metals due to wealth preservation. With the sector possibly becoming relevant again, it’s time to consider these gold stocks.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock', 'One of the top-tier metals and mining enterprises in the world, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) offers an excellent idea for conservative investors interested in gold stocks to buy. A diversified mining stalwart, BHP produces both gold and silver as a byproduct of copper production at the Olympic Dam project, located a few hundred miles north of Adelaide, South Australia.', 'For investors concerned about the ebb and flow of the commodities market, BHP brings some reassurances to the table because of its vast portfolio. As one of the biggest mining companies, BHP isn’t reliant on any single commodity. For example, at the aforementioned Olympic Dam, the mining firm uranium. Thanks to the asset’s supply shortage, uranium alone could help move the needle for BHP stock.', 'Another factor to consider when assessing the Melbourne, Australia-based company is its attractive financials. Currently, shares trade at 9.07X forward earnings, favorably below the sector median value of 10.9X. In addition, the company enjoys consistent profitability, backed by strong margins across the board. For a dependable idea among gold stocks that won’t leave you stranded, BHP should be on your radar.', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'For sector advocates seeking the undisputed kingpin of gold stocks, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) reigns supreme. This Denver-based titan boasts the title of world’s largest gold producer. It commands a sprawling footprint, extracting the precious metal from projects located in North and South America, Africa and Australia. Its diverse portfolio of mines mitigates risk, ensuring a steady flow of gold even when individual projects encounter hiccups.', 'Primarily, NEM ranks among the top gold stocks because of its size and dominance. However, it’s also an exploration powerhouse. Its aggressive hunt for new deposits secures long-term growth, keeping investors confident in its ability to replenish reserves and maintain its production crown. Plus, Newmont carries a forward dividend yield of 4.52%, well above the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%.', 'Notably, Newmont also maintains a commitment to responsible mining practices. That could help sway the younger generation of investors who are focused on environmental stewardship. Analysts peg shares a consensus moderate buy with a $48.08 price target. While NEM suffered a rough outing in the past one-year period, it could be due for a comeback based on cynically favorable fundamentals.', 'Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock', 'Crave gold exposure without the mining headaches? When you acquire typical gold stocks, you enjoy significant upside potential. However, the downside is that you don’t know what you’re getting until you get it (or don’t). And that’s where Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) comes into play. This Vancouver, British Columbia-based company isn’t a miner; no, instead it’s a streaming company.', 'Mainly, Wheaton secures long-term gold and silver streams from existing mines in exchange for upfront payments. The benefit here is predictability. Because the terms are pre-established, WPM generally avoids some of the wild ebb and flow associated with pure-play gold stocks. Still, that also means that upside could be mitigated. It’s something to watch out for, though Wheaton makes a solid case for portfolio diversification.', 'Now, it’s also fair to point out that WPM stakeholders pay for the predictability in another way: shares aren’t cheap. Trading at almost 37X forward earnings, WPM represents an 88%-plus premium to the sector median. However, it does benefit from consistent profitability and robust margins. Therefore, it’s worth a look.', 'Source: Alexander Limbach / Shutterstock', 'Similar to Wheaton, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) isn’t a pure-play participant among gold stocks. Instead, it’s a royalty firm, inking pre-arranged deals with mining enterprises. In this manner, Franco-Nevada benefits from pricing predictability. Now, the difference between a royalty and a streaming company is that the former involves receiving a fixed percentage of revenue in exchange for upfront capital. Streaming companies receive physical metals.', 'Another element that attracts investors to FNV is its conservative, risk-mitigated approach. The company’s leadership team meticulously chooses established, low-cost mines for its partnerships. In doing so, it prioritizes steady, predictable cash flows over high-risk exploration gambles. Still, shares lost a considerable amount of equity value in the past 52 weeks and that’s due to the forced shutdown of the Cobre Panama project due to a judicial setback.', 'However, the underlying fundamentals – the aforementioned headwind notwithstanding – remain positive. Further, analysts aren’t giving up on Franco-Nevada, pegging shares a consensus moderate buy with a $147.79 average price target. Backed by solid long-term revenue growth and healthy profit margins, FNV should be on your contrarian radar.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'For adventurous gold prospectors, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) presents an attractive opportunity. This Canadian explorer-producer hybrid scours the globe for hidden gold treasures, from the frozen tundra of Canada to the sun-drenched plains of Mexico. Its brownfield expansion strategy – meaning that it focuses on unearthing new veins near existing mines – minimizes risk and maximizes efficiency.', 'To be sure, I could have gone with gold stocks that represent pure-play exploration firms. It would make sense given the natural flow of this article. However, exploration-only companies tend to be extremely risky and lack confident predictability. At least with Agnico, you’re dealing with a revenue and income-generating enterprise. Also, shares trade at 9.18X trailing-year earnings, below the sector median 15.1X.', 'Another factor that distinguishes Agnico from its pure-play counterparts is that it pays a dividend; specifically, a forward yield of 3.27%. Yes, its payout ratio is elevated at just under 70%. Still, it’s within a somewhat reasonable range. Also, analysts rate AEM a unanimous strong buy with a $61.78 price target. Thus, it’s one of the gold stocks worth putting on your radar.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Another Canadian gold producer and explorer vying for your attention is Alamos Gold (NYSE:AGI). But unlike Agnico Eagle’s global reach, Alamos primarily focuses on near-mine exploration, squeezing every ounce of potential from its existing Canadian and Mexican operations. This “dig deeper” approach minimizes exploration costs and speeds up the path to production, potentially translating to quicker returns for investors.', 'Now, at least for the time being, those aren’t just pretty words I wrote down. In the past 52 weeks, AEM incurred a market loss of over 15%. In contrast, AGI popped up more than 4% during the same period. So, the little details among gold stocks can translate to tangible performance variances.', 'Now, where Alamos does fall a little short with its rival is in the passive income department. With a forward yield of only 0.83%, it’s a little light to put it diplomatically.', 'Still, to make up for it, the company enjoys strong profitability margins across the board. As well, its return on asset (ROA) clocks in at 5.42%, beating out over 90% of its peers. Lastly, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $16.12 price target.', 'Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.com', 'Venturing beyond the mine shafts, A-Mark Precious Metals (NASDAQ:AMRK) offers a unique gold experience – at least as far as gold stocks are concerned. This U.S.-based retailer isn’t about extracting gold; rather, it’s about putting it in your hands. Through online and physical stores, A-Mark caters to gold enthusiasts of all stripes, from seasoned investors to casual collectors.', 'Off the top, the A-Mark identity might not resonate immediately with investors. However, the company provides direct-to-consumer services through its wholly owned subsidiaries. These brands include powerhouses like JM Bullion and Goldline. While physical gold ownership is cumbersome – and kinda scary if people know where you live – it’s apparently a popular practice.', 'If I may be blunt, bullion retailers generally thrive on certain ideologies – and I’m not talking Republican or Democrat. Rather, the arena tends to fall under the doom-and-gloom narrative. But here’s the (cynically) good part: fear sells.', 'If you can’t titillate your customers, you can try to scare them. And with paranoia running high, A-Mark is operating in a metaphorical gold mine. Analysts recognize that potential, rating shares a unanimous strong buy with a $41.67 average price target.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

161,88772551-8882-45f3-a9f2-a844a7ec8939,M,2024-02-01,Another sneaky Biden energy move,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-sneaky-biden-energy-move-182802772.html,1706725682,STORY,['NG=F'],"['President Biden has done more to promote green energy than any other president in US history. It’s ironic that he remains remarkably bound to fossil fuels, in ways he probably hopes nobody notices.', 'Biden’s entire energy agenda during the last three years has paired the overt promotion of renewables with a covert effort to keep fossil fuels plentiful and cheap. The latest example is the Biden administration’s Jan. 26 decision to temporarily suspend the approval of new facilities for exporting natural gas. Current facilities will continue to operate, without any limit on exports.', 'The pause will let the Energy Department study the impact of surging US natural gas exports on the climate, domestic energy prices, national security concerns, and other factors. The review will take several months, followed by the usual comment period. You won’t go broke betting the farm that an outcome will come in 2025, well after the November elections.', 'In one regard, a review makes sense. The fracking revolution that kicked off around 2010 generated a massive boom in US fossil fuel production, which has made the United States the world’s biggest oil and gas producer. US law limited energy exports until President Barack Obama signed legislation and changed other rules broadly allowing oil and gas exports. Starting in 2015, gas exports soared. The Biden administration now says the rules for approving export facilities are outdated and need to account for the nearly fivefold rise in gas exports since 2014.', 'But there’s also a likely political angle when a president makes a controversial policy change in an election year. Environmental groups lobbied hard for the pause on new gas-export facilities, and they declared victory when the White House made the decision. So maybe Biden is reinvigorating his pitch to environmentally minded voters, who skew young and want to see more forceful action to banish the source of greenhouse gases causing global warming.', 'Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.', 'There could also be another target: keeping American energy prices low. Drillers often say that robust exports create an incentive to produce more gas, which in turn keeps domestic supplies abundant and prices low. But that may be wishful thinking. A 2023 analysis by the US Energy Information Administration found that “higher [gas] exports results in upward pressure on US natural gas prices and lower [gas] exports results in downward pressure.” It’s also true that gas prices in other markets, such as Europe and Asia, are considerably higher than in the United States, which creates an obvious incentive for American producers to sell outside the country where they can make more money.', ""So Biden might be making sure there’s no uptick in US energy prices while he’s running for reelection. Natural gas prices get far less attention than gasoline prices, but they’re arguably more important because natural gas powers 40% of the nation’s electricity generation and 60% of home heating. “It seems likely,” Kurt Cobb wrote recently on OilPrice.com, “that someone whispered into the administration's ear something about the possibility of much higher domestic prices in the coming years if the US LNG [liquified natural gas] export juggernaut is allowed to continue.”"", 'US natural gas prices did spike in 2022, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a sharp reduction of Russian gas exports to Europe and a scramble by other gas exporters to fill the gap. US natural gas prices are now back to the relatively low levels typical from 2015 to 2021.', 'Electricity costs have jumped, however, and stayed there. Since Biden took office, electricity costs have risen 27%. That’s a stealthy source of inflation, which has been Biden’s biggest economic problem. Higher electricity prices boost consumers’ utility bills, while also making it more expensive for businesses to produce goods and keep the lights on (literally). Businesses normally try to pass cost increases on to consumers.', ""When inflation spiked in 2022 and gasoline prices hit $5 per gallon, Biden's approval rating dropped sharply. Overall inflation is almost back to normal levels, but Biden clearly recognizes the risk that high energy prices pose to his political future. Since 2022, Biden has taken a variety of measures to lower energy prices: selling oil from the US reserve, asking Saudi Arabia to produce more oil, and even encouraging more energy production by ne'er-do-well nations Iran and Venezuela. Biden's credibility with environmentalists comes from the massive green energy plan he signed into law in 2022, but Biden's overall popularity relies far more on the cost of fossil fuels we're still dependent on."", ""There's good reason for Biden to retain the pro-export policy that began under Obama, continued under President Trump, and remained in place for Biden’s first three years in office. In a Jan. 26 analysis, the Eurasia Group argued that ongoing high levels of American gas exports are an important lifeline to Europe and a key lever of US power in other parts of the world, including Asia. Russia would clearly love more influence in those parts of the world, and the availability of American energy as an alternative to Russia's exports is a barrier to Russia's malign ambitions."", 'So maybe the Biden review will sound the all-clear, with a few permit denials to appease the climate lobby, if Biden wins reelection. But if evidence mounts that energy exports are raising costs for Americans, Biden won’t be the last president to have a problem with that.', 'Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Armando Pimentel, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.

With that, I will turn the call over to John."", 'John Ketchum: Thanks, Kristen, and good morning. NextEra Energy has strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources in 2023. NextEra Energy delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.17, up over 9% from 2022, exceeding the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. From solar supply chain challenges to higher inflation and interest rates, NextEra Energy navigated through a challenging environment for the last two years, delivering compound annual adjusted EPS growth of roughly 11.5% since 2021. These were unprecedented events for our sector and clear headwinds for renewables, but disruption often presents opportunity. At NextEra Energy, we relied on our 25 years of renewables experience and our culture of execution to navigate this tough environment.', 'On the strengths of our scale and competitive advantages, our world-class supply chain capabilities, customer relationships, access to and cost of capital advantages, the strength of our balance sheet, our data driven development playbook, and our team just to a name few we successfully managed through the disruption. Our scale and competitive advantages served as key differentiators and allowed us to continue to deliver for our customers and extend our long track record of earnings and dividend growth. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. Over that same period, the remaining top 10 power companies have achieved, on average, compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 2%.', 'Notwithstanding the strong adjusted EPS results, we recognize and are disappointed by the underperformance in the share price. And as we start 2024, we remain steadfast in our continued focus on execution and creating long-term value for shareholders. We believe that disruption over the last two years has made NextEra Energy an even stronger company. Our business model is more resilient, our development platform is even more advanced, and our supply chain is more diversified than it has ever been. Bottom line, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned headed into 2024. And there is good reason for optimism at NextEra Energy. Although nobody can predict with certainty what 2024 will bring, inflation and interest rates have declined from their peak, and NextEra Energy has taken steps to mitigate its exposure to interest rate volatility through its interest rate hedging program.', 'The Commerce Department has provided the final determination around circumvention, providing solar suppliers with more certainty around the rules and expectations of importing solar equipment. New solar supply chains have been established in the U.S. and internationally, leading to lower solar panel prices, and we see the continued longer-term push towards EVs as being incrementally positive for continued reductions in battery prices. Solar panel and battery prices have already declined by roughly 25% from their peak over the last 24 months, heading into 2024. We have proactively procured critical electrical equipment to complete our renewable projects, securing enough transformers and breakers to cover our expected build through 2027. And due to our scale and construction partnerships, we have not experienced any labor shortages impacting project timelines.', ""Ultimately, all these tailwinds are great for customers, and we believe should drive greater renewables demand in 2024 and beyond, all on the heels of consecutive record years for new renewables originations at Energy Resources in 2022 and 2023, totaling over 17 gigawatts. NextEra Energy offers a unique value proposition with two strong businesses that we believe are strategically positioned with outstanding prospects for future growth. FPL, which represents more than two-thirds of our company, is the nation's largest electric utility and continues to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition and one of the fastest growing states in the US. Energy Resources, the world's renewables leader, has differentiated itself in an industry in which scale, experience, and being well capitalized matters."", ""At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers, providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we identify investment opportunities that drive value for customers and support Florida's growing economy while keeping bills approximately 30% lower than the national average. We focus on running the business efficiently and continue to lead the industry with the lowest nonfuel O&M per megawatt hour of any large utility in the nation. Our emphasis on modernizing FPL's generation fleet to improve efficiency and reduce fuel costs has saved customers over $15 billion since 2001. We continue this trend in 2023 by placing into service approximately 1, 200 megawatts of cost effective solar and expect to add roughly 4,800 megawatts over the current rate agreement."", ""And by 2032, we expect to increase FPL's solar from 5% of our total generation today to roughly 35% by adding over 15,000 incremental megawatts. We are also continuing to invest in FPL's grid to make it stronger and more resilient for our customers. Almost all of FPL's transmission system has been hardened with concrete or steel towers or poles, and we continue to invest in undergrounding our distribution system to further enhance reliability and resiliency for customers. The capital plan of the current rate agreement of $32 billion to $34 billion extends our customer value proposition and provides clear visibility for growth through 2025. Beyond 2025, we continue to believe FPL is strategically well positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest growing states in the U.S. with a population growth that is expected to roughly double the national average through 2030."", ""Florida's economy is also growing and is now the 14th largest in the world if Florida were a country. FPL is responsible for keeping the lights on for approximately $2 billion per day of Florida's GDP. These long-term growth prospects, coupled with investment opportunities and renewables and transmission and distribution infrastructure, enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition and support our belief that FPL is the highest quality rate regulatory utility in the country. Energy Resources' deep expertise in renewables and transmission serves as a key differentiator with customers. As a result of our data-driven development playbook, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 9,000 megawatts to our backlog."", 'Driven in part by the roughly 5,600 megawatts placed in service in 2023, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings almost 13% versus 2022. Energy Resources continues to see strong demand and is well positioned to realize its development expectations over the four-year period ending 2026. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of the range, Energy Resources will be operating a roughly 63 gigawatt renewable portfolio by the end of 2026. That would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but nine countries. Energy Resources also is extending its excellent track record of optimizing our existing footprint to create additional shareholder value. To date, we have repowered six gigawatts of our existing 24 gigawatt wind operating fleet, investing roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build and starting a new 10 years of production tax credits, resulting in attractive returns for shareholders.', ""By 2026, Energy Resources' wind footprint could be roughly 32 gigawatts, and with over a decade to potentially qualify for repowering, it represents a great opportunity set. We believe there are multiple opportunities to drive value from the existing footprint, multiple wind repowers, adding solar underneath existing wind and locating battery storage with existing wind and solar. And we have dedicated teams leveraging our development playbook to optimize our existing and future fleet. We can maximize existing land, permits, interconnection capacity, and operations to provide enhanced value to customers and shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources could operate up to 53 gigawatts of generation with the potential to co-locate battery storage, which represents a great long-term opportunity, especially considering the likely future capacity needs of customers."", ""Throughout 2023, Energy Resources also continue to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business. As growth and renewables occur throughout the U.S., there is a growing imperative to build additional or upgrade existing transmission. 2023 was a record year for our competitive transmission business. NextEra Energy transmission was awarded projects to construct transmission in PJM, CAISO and SPP that would roughly double the investments made in the existing business. We anticipate deploying approximately $1.9 billion of capital through 2027 to complete these transmission projects, which we estimate could enable up to 12 gigawatts of new renewables. Beyond 2026, Energy Resources is strategically positioned to benefit significantly from the irreversible shift towards electrification."", 'With renewables only comprising roughly 16% of the U.S. generating mix, Energy Resources is just getting started. Renewable penetration is expected to double to over 30% by 2030, and Energy Resources is ready. We have a substantial development pipeline, including roughly 150 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions for new renewables and storage projects. We believe Energy Resources has the most comprehensive renewable energy business in the world and is better positioned than ever to capitalize on long-term growth prospects. FPL and Energy Resources individually have executed well, delivering value for our customers, both businesses complement each other, push one another to be better, and together create scale and foster innovation. We have one of the sectors strongest balance sheets and constructed and placed in the service roughly 6, 800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects in 2023.', ""To put that into context, 6, 800 megawatts of installed U.S. renewable generating capacity is enough on its own to rank as the fourth largest U.S. renewable energy company and the 14th largest utility. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the partnership's transition plans and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. Last September, we made the tough decision to reduce the target distribution growth rate to 6% when NextEra Energy Partners no longer benefited from a competitive cost to capital. With a growth rate now comparable to its peers, we are focused on the partnership's cost to capital improving, which is critical for its future success. Towards that end, we are evaluating alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financings with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond."", 'We are executing against the transition plans and with the closing of the Texas Pipeline portfolio sale, the partnership has addressed two of the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financings. The STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing has been extinguished and we have sufficient proceeds available to complete the NEP Renewables to buyouts that are due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the Meade natural gas pipeline assets is expected to be addressed in 2025. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect the need and acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth and LP distributions per unit target and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027.', 'We are executing against the growth plans and have identified approximately 985 megawatts of wind repowers through 2026 making progress against our expectations. As we turn the page on 2023 and head into 2024, we are optimistic about the renewable sector, about our opportunity set, about customer demand, and about NextEra Energy’s future. Demand for renewables has never been stronger, and yet the challenges have never been more complex, making the stakes even higher for customers. Our scale and competitive advantages are enabling us to be the partner of choice with both power and commercial and industrial customers. On March 14th, we will discuss Energy Resources development process in greater detail at our Development Investor event in Juno Beach and illustrate how our proprietary tools differentiate Energy Resources with customers.', ""And then on June 11th, we will hold our NextEra Energy Investor Day in New York to discuss our long-term plans for both Energy Resources and FPL. Our optimism for NextEra Energy's future flows from the strength of our two world class businesses, FPL and Energy Resources, that leverage our scale and competitive advantages to differentiate themselves as leaders. Our optimism is driven from our proven playbooks of deploying capital and renewables and transmission to create value for customers. But I am most optimistic because we have spent the last two decades building a world class team at NextEra Energy, and it is, by far, our greatest competitive strength. Our team lives and breathes a culture of continuous improvement working together to solve the tough challenges of the day."", 'We drive innovation relying on data analytics and automation to make better decisions, and we have developed and deployed smart, low cost, clean energy solutions that lead our industry. Most importantly, our team remains hyper focused on continuing our long track record of execution, serving our customers with excellence and providing long term value for shareholders. With that let me turn it over to Kirk who will review the 2023 results in more detail.', ""Kirk Crews : Thanks John. Let's begin with FPL's detailed results. For the full year 2023 FPL's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.22 versus 2022. FPL's adjusted earnings results exclude the approximately $300 million after tax gain on the sale of Florida City Gas which closed on November 30th 2023. The principal driver of the 2023 full year performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.5%. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth and regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four year term of our current rate agreement, which runs through 2025. For the full year 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the full year 2023, we used approximately $227 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a yearend 2023 balance of roughly $1.2 billion."", ""FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.4 billion. These capital investments supported the successful commissioning of roughly 1, 200 megawatts of solar in 2023, continued hardening of the grid, and our efforts to underground our distribution system. During the fourth quarter of 2023, our 25 megawatt hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center successfully achieved commercial operations. As a reminder, we plan to utilize this facility together with adjacent solar projects to create green hydrogen and blend it with natural gas at our Okeechobee plant. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains strong and Florida's population continues to be one of the fastest growing in the country."", ""Florida's economy continues to trend upward, and its GDP is now roughly $1.6 trillion, an increase of 9.3% over last year. For the fourth quarter of 2023, FPL's retail sales increased 1.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth, which increased by nearly 81, 000 from the prior year comparable quarter. For the full year 2023, FPL retail sales increased 0.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, also driven primarily by the strong customer growth in our service territory. Now, let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported full year adjusted earnings growth of approximately 12.9% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.35 per share due to strong growth in our renewables and storage portfolio."", 'Contributions from our existing clean energy assets decreased results by $0.11 per share, driven primarily by the impact of weaker wind resource. 2023 was the lowest wind resource on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.16 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer facing businesses. Other decreased results by $0.26 per share year-over-year. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.22 per share, of which $0.10 was driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 9, 000 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog, which includes approximately 2, 060 megawatts since our last call.', 'Our 2023 origination performance reflects continued strong demand from power customers looking for the least cost alternative to serve load and to replace uneconomic generation and commercial and industrial customers looking to help decarbonize their operation or meet their data center and AI demand. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 20 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 2, 470 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our third quarter call. We believe our 20 gigawatt backlog provides clear visibility and Energy Resources’ ability to deliver for shareholders through 2026 and beyond. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the full year adjusted earnings from our corporate and other segment decreased by $0.08 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs.', 'We successfully supported the growth in our underlying businesses from our strong operating cash flows, including the sale of tax credits as well as our historical funding sources. In 2023, we grew cash flow from operations well in excess of our adjusted earnings. We transferred approximately $400 million of tax credits, establishing relationships with numerous counterparties. We believe this will prove to be a competitive advantage as buyers look first to NextEra Energy given its size, experience, and the overall quality of its tax credit program. Overall, our funding plans for 2024 through 2026 remain consistent with the information we shared on the third quarter earnings call. We continue to believe NextEra Energy is well positioned to manage the interest rate environment.', 'While the recent decline in interest rates is encouraging, we remain committed to managing the business to deliver value for customers and shareholders. Overall, we believe we are well positioned with $18.5 billion of interest rate swaps and we will continue to closely monitor the interest rate environment as the clients and rates certainly represent a tail end for our sector and customers. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025, and 2026. For the last 14 consecutive years, NextEra Energy has met or exceeded its financial expectation, which is a record we are proud of. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range.', ""And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. In terms of the transition plans, NextEra Energy Partners closed the sale of Texas pipeline portfolio in late December, providing net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. NextEra Energy Partners expect to complete the NEP Renewables II buyouts of roughly $190 million and $950 million on their stated minimum buyout dates of June 2024 and 2025, respectively, as the partnerships continue to benefit from the low cash coupon through 2025. In terms of NextEra Energy Partners ' growth plan, as a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically repowerings of approximately 1.3 gigawatt of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields."", 'Today, we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 245 MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 985 MW of repowers with strong cash available for distribution yields. While the partnership does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024, the LP distribution growth target of 6% is supported, in part with roughly 175 MW of wind repowers, which are expected to generate attractive cash available for distribution yields. Finally, we were pleased with the high yield note issuance of $750 million, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2023. This opportunistic refinancing allowed the partnership to pay off its corporate revolver in mid-December. Let me now turn to the financial results for NextEra Energy Partners.', ""Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $454 million, and cash available for distribution was $86 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions and the incentive distribution's right fee suspension, while cash available for distribution was also impacted by incremental debt service. For the full year 2023, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.9 billion, up 13.6% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the contribution for new projects acquired in late 2022 and during 2023 and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension. New investments added approximately $228 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension added approximately $113 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year."", 'This growth was partially offset by a decline from existing projects driven primarily by weaker wind resource. Cash available for distribution was $689 million for the full year and primarily driven by contributions from new projects of approximately $42 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension of $113 million while being partially offset by the weaker wind resource. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.88 per common unit or $3.52 per unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its third quarter 2023 distribution per unit. The partnership grew its LP distributions per unit by more than 8% year-over-year. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026.', 'We continue to expect the partnership payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners is introducing December 31, 2024 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and cash available for distribution in a range of $730 million to $820 million reflecting calendar year 2025 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveat. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will open the line for questions.', 'See also 10 Highest Quality Egg Brands in the US and 15 Highest Quality Creatine Supplements of 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The clean energy infrastructure operator lost nearly 60% of its value last year, pushing its dividend yield into the double digits. The company battled balance sheet and growth concerns, forcing it to launch a new strategy to shore up its financial profile while continuing to grow. ', 'The renewable energy producer has already made solid progress on its plan. However, it still has a lot of work to do. Because of that, questions remain about the long-term sustainability of its high-yielding dividend.', 'Surging interest rates and a slumping stock price forced NextEra Energy Partners to pivot from its original strategy. The clean energy infrastructure company had planned to increase its dividend at a 12% to 15% annual rate through 2026. It aimed to power that growth by using low-cost funding to acquire income-producing renewable energy assets from its parent, NextEra Energy, and third parties.', 'However, with its cost of capital soaring, the company can no longer obtain new financing at an attractive rate. That made it challenging to refinance maturing financing and fund its continued growth. That led the company to make several notable changes. It planned to sell its natural gas pipeline assets to buy out some funding vehicles. It also slashed its dividend growth target rate to 5%-8% annually, with a 6% goal. ', ""NextEra Energy Partners has already made headway on that plan.

', 'Meanwhile, the company has now identified 985 megawatts (MW) of wind energy projects it plans to repower through 2026 that should generate strong investment returns. It expects to complete 175 MW of those projects this year. Those projects should generate the growing cash flow needed to support its plan to increase its payout by 6% this year without making another acquisition.

AGR announced its first onshore wind project in Oklahoma, a 147.5-megawatt (MW) wind farm with 33 turbines called Pontotoc Wind. The project will generate about 500,000 megawatt-hour of power each year.This project will be constructed in Pontotoc County. It will deliver clean, renewable wind power to 40,000 homes and expand AVANGRID’s presence in the United States to 25 states.The construction work is expected to start in 2024. AGR anticipates the project to benefit the neighborhood for almost 20 years.', ""AVANGRID is among the largest renewable energy operators in the United States, with an installed renewable capacity of more than 8.6 gigawatts (GW). After the abovementioned project's completion, the company will have assets or activities across half of the nation.Post the merger agreement’s termination with PNM Resources PNM, AGR also remains focused on developing New Mexico's wind and solar energy resources. With more than $9 billion of incremental capital projects organically secured during the pendency of the merger, the company intends to focus on its strong growth prospects.In addition to the capital projects related to the transmission of clean energy in New York, AGR will focus on delivering more than $5 billion of capital projects under its multiannual rate plans in New York and Maine, repowering more than $5 billion of renewable energy assets under the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).The company is progressing on its Vineyard Wind 1 offshore project, with the installation of five wind turbines by December 2023.

The easing of the global semiconductor shortage played a pivotal role in Japan's car sales recovery, with the Honda N-Box retaining its position as the most popular passenger car."", 'Additionally, EV sales surged 50% in 2023. While government subsidies for EVs and charging stations will serve as incentives for buyers, sales growth of zero-emission vehicles is expected to be gradual compared to regions like the United States and Europe, where government regulations actively drive EV adoption to support the automotive industry.

Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Synchrony Financial's dividend performance and assess its sustainability."", ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', ""Synchrony Financial, originally a spinoff of GE Capital's retail financing business, is the largest provider of private-label credit cards in the United States by both outstanding receivables and purchasing volume.

Synchrony operates through three segments: retail card (private-label and co-branded general-purpose credit cards), payment solutions (promotional financing for large ticket purchases), and CareCredit (financing for elective healthcare procedures)."", 'Synchrony Financial has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2016, distributing dividends on a quarterly basis.

Based on Synchrony Financial's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost for Synchrony Financial stock as of today is approximately 3.69%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends.

As of 2023-12-31, Synchrony Financial's dividend payout ratio is 0.19."", ""Synchrony Financial's profitability rank is 6 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported positive net income for each of the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability."", ""To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Synchrony Financial's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests a fair growth outlook. Its revenue model is strong, as indicated by the revenue per share and the 3-year revenue growth rate, with a 6.90% average annual increase, outperforming approximately 58.2% of global competitors."", ""The 3-year EPS growth rate demonstrates Synchrony Financial's ability to grow its earnings by about 3.40% per year on average, outperforming approximately 43.69% of global competitors.

Coupled with positive growth metrics, the company appears well-positioned to continue rewarding shareholders with dividends.

A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach."", 'Michael Miebach', ""Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. Here's the headline. We closed out 2023 with another quarter of strong earnings and revenue growth. Quarter 4 net revenues were up 11% and operating income up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, as always. These results were driven by healthy consumer spending and the ongoing execution of our strategy. Our deal momentum continued this quarter, powered by a broad range of unique, diversified products and services, both designed to solve our customers' needs. Let's start on the macroeconomic front, where we see both tailwinds and headwinds. First, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and rising wages. These remain key drivers of consumer spending. Some risks we are monitoring include credit availability and delinquency rates. Second, while inflation continues to moderate, prices of many goods and services remain elevated. We're tracking the efforts of central banks who are actively managing interest rates to normalize inflation. And finally, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern in several markets. On balance, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook, but we are monitoring the environment closely, and we'll manage the business accordingly. Looking at our switch trends this quarter. Domestic volume growth remains healthy. And cross-border spending remains strong, up 18% globally in the fourth quarter on a local currency basis. With that as a backdrop, we remain focused on our strategic priorities, which fuel our growth algorithm across payments, and services and new networks. In payments, our growth algorithm consists of 5 key areas: one, being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies. Two, accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments across both spend and transactions; three, further penetrating the addressable market in new flows and four, growing market share; and five, optimizing our customer portfolios for performance. Economies are growing, and that's not in our control. However, we are executing on the rest. Building on that, the run rate for the secular shift is substantial. We are accelerating it by scaling acceptance, enhancing the user experience for digital transactions and driving adoption in new sectors and new use cases. In 2023, we added millions of new acceptance locations worldwide. This growth has been aided by scaling our tap on phone and cloud commerce capabilities. We are now live in over 18 markets. Smaller merchants can start accepting payments by simply downloading an app. And larger merchants are leveraging the technology to promote quick and seamless checkout experiences anywhere in store. With supporting partners like Apple, who in 2023, expanded tap to pay on iPhone into Australia, the U.K., France, Brazil and several other markets. We're also accelerating the secular shift away from both from cash and closed loop transactions such as transit through our contactless capabilities. Contactless provides a fast, secure and seamless consumer experience in areas like transit, creates an opportunity to capture incremental transactions with a tap for every single ride. And when consumers use contactless for transit, they often extend that behavior across other low dollar spend categories. We've made great progress with many major cities such as London and New York, operating broad-based open-loop systems. However, there is still significant runway for us, given that only a small percentage of large cities globally are operating open-loop systems at scale. And we're leaning into advanced payment technologies like Click to Pay, tokenization and biometrics. They offer embedded, secure and password-free checkout solutions and with that, bring in elevated level of security, simplicity and speed to every transaction. And that's true regardless of the device, browser or card. These solutions not only benefit consumers, but they also create value for merchants as their customers are less likely to abandon a transaction and issuers also benefit from an increase in customer stickiness. For Click to Pay, we are now live in over 35 countries, supported by over 50 channel partners. And in 2023, we drove over 60% growth in transactions. Klarna will implement Click to Pay this year and activate their merchants across all European markets where they operate. We're driving tokenization across all channels, including devices, commerce platforms, card on file and guest checkout. Tokenization reduces fraud and increases approval rates by approximately 3 to 6 percentage points across regions. And we're expanding our biometric payment capabilities, which enable payments with a smile or a wave. After launching in Brazil, we have now partnered with NEC Corporation to bring our biometric checkout to the Asia Pacific region. We're also driving growth by winning and retaining deals across consumer payments, account-to-account and new flows. This week, we shared that BOK Financial will flip its U.S. debit portfolio to Mastercard making us the exclusive partner across its debit and commercial portfolios. They selected us due to our differentiated virtual card and open banking assets, fraud solutions and our shared commitment to financial inclusion. This marks the third U.S. regulated debit flip we signed in the last year, building on our recent successes with Citizens and Webster Bank, both of which have now started converting their portfolios. And BPER Banca, one of the largest banks in Italy will migrate their debit card to Mastercard as well. We renewed our partnership with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, we will retain exclusivity across their consumer credit and debit portfolios. We signed a long-term partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in Korea to solidify our leadership in the country. This relationship spans consumer and commercial card offerings and expand into new services, including data analytics. And in Canada, we executed an exclusive long-term renewal of the President's Choice Financial, consumer credit and prepaid portfolios. We're also winning in fintechs, co-brands and public sector partners. When it comes to fintechs, MasterCard is a partner of choice. In fact, Mastercard serves over 80% of the top digital payment in Neobank fintechs on the CNBC Global Fintech list. With the support of Starling Bank, one of the largest fintechs in the U.K. renewed their partnership with MasterCard. In the co-brand space, we're partnering with J.Crew and Synchrony in the U.S. to launch the retailer's first co-branded digital first card. And in the public sector, we have an exclusive partnership with Fiserv Money Network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. As part of our partnership, we are thrilled to launch with the California Economic Development Department in February, the largest unemployment program in the United States. As you can see, we continue our positive deal momentum powered by our differentiated products and services are always keeping a focus on financial discipline. This also helps us to capture more of the secular tailwind and in turn, further drive services growth. Looking to China. We are thrilled that our joint venture in China has received formal approval to commence domestic bank card clearing. Believe that we will be uniquely positioned to provide Chinese consumers with an exceptional payment experience using a single card that's optimized for both domestic and cross-border spend. While we're excited about the medium- to long-term opportunity, there's still work to be done as we fully build out the issuing and acceptance footprint. As we do that, we continue to grow our presence with bank and fintech partners in the market. ICBC launched the first World MasterCard product in November, and Bank of Communications selected Mastercard to launch their first international debit card. Beyond cards, we also continue to make meaningful progress in the account-to-account space. This quarter, we announced a long-term strategic partnership with the Clearing House, the operator of the RTP network, which continues to secure our position in real-time payments in the United States. Now shifting gears. We continue to execute against our strategy to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new flows, including commercial payments and disbursements and remittances. We continue to win in commercial. This spans commercial point of sale and B2B accounts payable, which we target through our market-leading virtual card solution. This quarter alone, we renewed our commercial relationships with JPMorgan and FLEETCOR 2 of the largest commercial issuers in the United States. BNP Paribas Fortis will flip their business credit portfolio to Mastercard in Belgium. And on the virtual card front, we announced 2 exciting partnerships in the online travel agency space with Booking.com and Agoda. Turning now to disbursements and remittances. In 2023, we grew transactions by over 30%. We continue to scale our use cases. For example, UBS has integrated our cross-border services capability. This will enable them to execute instant cross-border payments from multiple use cases, including helping their customers pay employees abroad. In addition, we also partnered with Alipay to establish them as a cross-border payments receiving institution in China. Payments, services and new networks reinforce each other. We said it countless times, our services and new networks provide differentiation, as noted in many of the wins I mentioned. Underlying payments growth helps drive services too. And payments growth brings incremental rich data. Our services turn that data into valuable insights and when implemented by our customers, those insights can drive incremental digitization of payments. In turn, this generates even more data, more transaction and more need for fraud tools and the powerful cycle continues. The services and new networks components of our growth algorithms are built on, driving increased penetration of existing customers, extending our services across new customers and customer types, and continuing to build and deploy new services. Here are a few examples how we are executing against each of these. The past year, Bank of America has expanded their services relationship with us to include test and learn program management and supplier enablement solutions. This on top of many of our services they already have. Axis Bank in India has also expanded their relationship with us. They will use our consulting, marketing and analytics services to support end-to-end portfolio life cycle management. Worldpay is utilizing our fraud alerts to streamline the dispute resolution process. And Citi has deployed consumer clarity, digital receipts to provide eligible U.S. cardholders with detailed purchase information directly through their bank app. Now with increased visibility about the merchant and purchase details, consumers can easily validate transactions and reduce the number of disputes they file. Square is also integrating consumer clarity solution. Furthermore, Nexi has chosen Mastercard as a strategic partner to roll out Open Banking for e-commerce payments across Europe and the list goes on. We're extending our services and solutions across new customer types, including large marketplaces. Alibaba will use Mastercard's open banking technology to help streamline the onboarding experience for small businesses on the U.S. marketplace and reduce fraud. And Meta utilizes our digital identity technology to improve authentication for online orders. We also continue to develop new services and solutions, many of which leverage the work we are doing with generative AI.Generative AI brings more opportunity to drive better experiences for our customers, makes it easier to extract insights from our data. It can also help us increase internal productivity. We are working on many Gen AI use cases today to do just that. For example, we recently announced shopping news, shopping news users generative AI to offer a conversational shopping tool that recreates the in-store human experience online, can translate consumers collegially language into tailored recommendations. Another example is Mastercard Small Business AI. The tool will draw on our existing small business resources, along with the content from a newly formed global media coalition to help business owners navigate a range of business challenges. The platform, which is scheduled for pilot launch later this year will leverage AI to provide personalized real-time assistance delivered in a conversational tone. And finally, we expanded Mastercard access, which provides customers with a single point of connectivity to quickly and easily source our AI, digital and identity services. Using access, customers can deploy these services across multiple rails or networks, including those outside the MasterCard network. This is an exciting development, which enhances our ability to scale our services across networks and streamlines the ability for our customers to adopt our capabilities. So with that, I will wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter and year of revenue and earnings growth. We're successfully executing against our strategy and on our growth algorithm, our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you."", 'Sachin Mehra', ""Thanks, Michael. Turning now to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased by 15% and 18%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a nonrecurring tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter. EPS was $3.18, which includes an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.8 billion worth of stock and an additional $586 million through January 26, 2024. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 4% with credit growth of 5% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13% with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 12%. Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the NatWest portfolio migration in the U.K. Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q3, this is primarily due to tougher comps as we continue to lap the cross-border travel recovery from last year. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q4, both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 65% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the fourth quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment Network net revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 17%, primarily driven by strong growth in our Cyber & Intelligence Solutions, driven by the growth in our underlying drivers and the continued scaling of our fraud and security solutions and our identity and authentication solutions. In addition, we saw strong growth in our marketing, data analytics and consulting services as well as our loyalty solutions. This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric. Domestic assessments were up 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 10%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 21%, while cross-border volumes increased 18%. The 3 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 10%, while switched transactions grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments were $251 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives and increased spending on marketing campaigns, advertising and sponsorships like the UEFA Champions League and the Rugby World Cup. Turning to Page 9, you will see that we are no longer providing operating metrics as a percentage of 2019 given that we are well past the pandemic. Now let me comment on the operating metric trends in the fourth quarter and through the first 4 weeks of January. Starting with switched volume growth year-over-year. The sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 is primarily due to the lapping effects from the routing of all MasterCard branded volume in Japan to the Mastercard switch and the migration of the NatWest portfolio to Mastercard. Specific to the U.S., the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 was primarily due to tougher comps. Moving to the first 4 weeks of January, switched volume growth in the U.S. was impacted primarily by severe weather events across the country. As we look specifically at the fourth week of January, which did not have the same impact from severe weather, switched volume in the U.S. returned to approximately 5% growth year-over-year, similar to what we saw in December. Outside of the U.S., we continue to lap the migration of the NatWest portfolio. Switch transactions follow similar patterns to switched volumes. Looking at cross-border for both Q4 and the first 4 weeks of January, cross-border travel growth continues to be primarily impacted by tougher comps as we lap the recovery of travel. Cross-border card not present ex travel continues to show strength. Turning now to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts on fiscal year 2024. Let me start by saying our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to grow through a combination of healthy consumer spending, new and renewed customer agreements, continued secular shift from cash to card and strong growth across our service offerings. In short, as Michael said, we are executing on our strategy and realizing the benefits from our growth algorithm. Overall, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook. Consumer spending continues to be supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Our base case scenario for 2024 reflects healthy consumer spending and recent spending dynamics. That being said, we are closely monitoring both positives and negatives in the macro environment as well as geopolitical events and we stand ready to manage our investment levels as appropriate, while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. As it relates to the full year 2024, our base case is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. In terms of operating expenses, we expect full year growth at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Of note, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt in operating expense due to a new Brazil tax legislation, which went into effect as of January 1, 2024. This legislation results in higher operating expenses due to an increase in indirect taxes, which is more than offset by a reduction in our income taxes expense. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the year. Now turning to Q1 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the quarter. Let me briefly talk through why our full year currency-neutral net revenue growth is expected to be higher than the first quarter of 2024. This is primarily driven by 2 factors: first, revenues related to FX volatility were highest in Q1 2023 compared to the other quarters in the year. And second, while our value-added services and solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace. From a cadence perspective, we expect Q1 growth to be lower relative to the other quarters, primarily due to tougher comps. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Once again, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. Acquisitions are forecasted to add 0 to 1 ppt to this OpEx growth and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we expect an expense of approximately $60 million to $65 million for Q1, given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17% for Q1 and approximately 17% on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. This reflects the benefit to our effective tax rate related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin."", 'Devin Corr', 'Thank you. Brianna, you may open the call for questions now.', 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein."", 'Harshita Rawat', ""I want to ask about U.S. card volumes. So weather aside, the growth has decelerated a bit to mid-single-digit levels versus what we've seen in the last 5 to 10 years, especially if you compare that to PCE. So how should we think about kind of a normalized card volume growth in the U.S. Or is there simply more runway, a number of transactions. So that's the metric we should be watching? And also, just as a follow-up, can you also comment on Reg II impact on U.S. bonds."", 'Sachin Mehra', ""Sure, Harshita. Let me take both of those questions. First, on Reg II, let me just kind of share with everybody that from a Reg II standpoint, we haven't seen any material impact come through as far as what we've seen so far on the data. Obviously we will keep a close eye on it as the year progresses, but nothing to actually report from any sort of material impact. On your question around U.S. card volume growth, look at the end of the day, here's the way we think about it, right? We continue to believe that in the U.S., there remains a decent amount of secular opportunity, both from a volume standpoint and from a transaction growth standpoint. In addition to that, as you know, business models are evolving, spending behaviors are changing, and that creates greater opportunity from a volume and a transaction standpoint. But more specifically, what I'd tell you is the following, which is in the release of the U.S.We've got to kind of think about what's going on with PCE and what the impact of inflation is in the PCE numbers relative to where it's taking place, i.e., is it taking place in carded volumes? Or is it taking in place in noncarded categories of spend. So as you do the analysis, at least as we do the analysis, the way we think about this is we look at PCE, we think about on a normalized basis, if inflation were to take place fairly evenly across both carded and non-carded PCE, it gives us a high degree of comfort that there's a decent amount of secular opportunity, which still remains in the U.S. from a growth standpoint. Now in addition to the secular opportunity and the fact that the U.S. continues to actually perform well from an overall consumer health standpoint, we're very active. We're growing our volumes by winning share. I mean you've heard about this quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we're doing to win volumes from new customers. We've had good wins on the debit space, which, as you know, is a challenged kind of environment in the U.S. So overall, I tell you from the U.S. standpoint, it continues to be a very important market, one which is going to be a decent contributor to our growth driven by the PCE growth component, the secular shift as well as share. And again, what I'm talking about is on the card payment volume side of the business."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners.', 'Craig Jared Maurer', ""So 2 questions. One, to what degree are conversions of new wins contributing to fiscal year '24 guidance? And secondly, regarding China, knowing that you need to launch your business there within 6 months of approval. I was wondering if you could characterize conversations with issuers there and whether you've been able to keep warm relationships with those issuers over the years, considering you're in a very strong position in China when regulations changed, whatever it was 7, 8 years ago."", 'Michael Miebach', ""Right. Let me take the China question first and we come back to the conversion topic that you raised. So needless to say, we're thrilled about China. So this is a -- it's a massive economy, and we feel we're well positioned to serve it. As I said in my remarks at the beginning, we feel we're uniquely positioned to put into the hand of Chinese consumers a solution -- a seamless solution that works domestically as well as when they travel. That's not unique. There's another competitor that has that kind of a proposition. But we do have the much better acceptance network to provide an end-to-end solution that works well.On that basis, we're busy right now with our partners in China with the banks with acquirers, issuers and so forth to discuss rolling out on the issuing side as well as on the acceptance side for 6 months, as you rightly said. Now for years, we have been very active in China on the cross-border side. And those are strong relationships with the same exact banks. And we're just -- I mentioned 2, with ICBC and Bank of Communications, we're just launching new products. So the fact that we are well positioned today with the banks gives us an edge here on moving forward at speed. As I also said, going live within the first 6 months doesn't mean that we're live everywhere, and we have to build this out over time to get full opportunity in the medium to the long-term. And on the conversion piece, just to know, for the U.S., we saw -- I mentioned this earlier for Webster and for Citizens conversion is starting. Some of the big conversions in Europe have already completed. Sachin talked about the lapping for NatWest and so forth. So Sachin, if there's anything else?"", 'Sachin Mehra', ""I would just add, like Michael said, right? I mean as you would imagine, in terms of how we think about 2024 and our thoughts for 2024, we do factor in what our best estimate as it relates to the conversion of the portfolios. What I'd tell you is we've had a decent amount of wins across the globe. We -- for the most part, the sizable ones are staggered wins as and they come on over a period of time. They're not episodic flips, which will take place all at one time. So for example, Citizens, Webster, UniCredit, Deutsche Bank, all of these will play out over the course of '24 and in some instances, over multiple years. So we factor in our best estimates on those conversions as we kind of put our thoughts together for the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.', 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', 'Sachin, thank you for sort of cadence for the year with the first quarter. But I was just wondering, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the expectations for payments versus the value-added service revenues? And then specific to that Brazil tax legislation. I guess, is it neutral to EPS? It adds to OpEx, but lower taxes? Just maybe you could help us with that, too.', 'Sachin Mehra', ""Sure. Let me just take the Brazil one first, and I'll come back to your second question. So on the Brazil piece, it increases our operating expenses because it's an increase in indirect taxes, which are there. That is a -- it's more than offset in our tax rate and in the thoughts we've given you from a tax rate standpoint. So from an overall EPS standpoint, it actually ends up being slightly accretive because of the more than offset, which is taking place on the tax line there. On your question around payments versus value-added services and solutions expectations. Look, we're not giving specific guidance as it relates to how we see payment network revenue and value-added services and solutions revenue. But at the high level, here's what I'd say, let me first address the value-added services and solutions piece. We continue to see good growth in our solutions around everything around our fraud and security solutions, data analytics and insights and we're building all of those into our thoughts for the year. We've had a good year in 2023. We continue to see a good outlook for value-services and solutions going into 2024.Likewise, for payments, right? I mean as you can imagine, in payments, it's a function of what we think will happen from a carded market volume growth rate standpoint and what the impacts will be from share wins as well as the impacts of rebates and incentives. So all of that kind of is factored in. What I would tell you broadly is that we continue to expect value-added services and solutions to grow at a faster pace than we do on the payment network side."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.', 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""Just thinking about the outlook. I think Harshita to ask it as well, just the outlook for growth between the U.S. and rest of world. Any -- anything to call out there? Do you expect the trends observed in '23 to be different in 2024 here between the 2 regions?"", 'Sachin Mehra', ""Yes, Tien-Tsin, honestly, I would tell you from a secular opportunity standpoint, right? I mean, we continue to believe, broadly speaking, the secular opportunity is greater outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. There's a good news, bad news story there. And the good news is that, that means we've been quite successful in driving the secular shift opportunity in the U.S., which is what you're seeing in the results come through. And again, from a bad news standpoint is there's a lower remaining opportunity on the volume side in the U.S. But if you ask me the question on a year-over-year basis, I would tell you, I don't expect any meaningful shift in terms of suddenly the trajectory of how the secular opportunity is being realized between the U.S. and the rest of the world to be changing between '23 and '24."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Daniel Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Daniel Rock Perlin', ""I heard you call out a couple of times geopolitical concerns, and I know that there's some, I don't know, 30 or 40 different elections happening around the globe. So my question to you is as you think about managing those potential concerns, are there certain regions where you feel like there could be pockets of more nationalistic behavior, which would be problematic for you guys getting into those markets? Or that because of election years historically, what you've seen are that it kind of slows down adoption and some of the secular trends that you would have otherwise been able to enjoy in maybe a nonelection year. So just trying to handicap what maybe some of those positives and negatives could be just geopolitically this year."", 'Michael Miebach', ""Dan, you just touched on some of the key things to watch out for. But this is no different than us monitoring fiscal monetary policy reactions by central banks and governments. So those are all things that affect consumer sentiment, potentially affect consumer spending. So we'll just have to stay close to what that is. Our discipline around these things is to do some solid scenario planning and making sure our playbook in terms of managing our financial responsibility -- responsibly is up to date. Certainly, the last 3 years have had no shortages of such challenges, and we adapted quickly. More specifically to the points that you mentioned, elections happen regularly. So there is nothing dramatically new in 2024 and geopolitical conflicts, they've been around, and they keep going. And that is something we'll watch what is the impact on energy prices and various downstream into the broader economy. Yet again, our Economics Institute is keeping a focus on that. So nothing very specific. That's why we kept it relatively high level. But these days, one has to just take a look left and right all the time."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.', 'Darrin David Peller', ""It's good to see the value-add services solutions accelerate going back to 17% from 14%. Maybe you could just revisit that for a minute in terms of -- I know you sounded confident that should sustain strong growth relative to the business. And so maybe just revisit the drivers of that and what gives you the confidence that sustains and really just overall, what's the -- what's -- if you sort of rank the top items in that category?"", 'Michael Miebach', ""So let me kick off on that. If you split out the value-added services here, you have our other services, which Sachin touched on earlier, for example, our real-time payment assets and things like that. The thing that we have historically focused on here in this space is our Cyber & Intelligence solutions, fraud solutions, and the data insights and analytics solutions. So if you think about how that flywheel talks about, I talked about the powerful cycle earlier on, so more payments that need to be kept safe, more payments throughout more data, which drive more data analytics inside. That is the underlying kind of secular trend, which is pretty closely related to the secular shift as well. So that is the baseline of growth here. And then you look at some of the more specific growth drivers here. For example, in data analytics, in that group, we also have our personalization solution. So everybody is trying to engage their consumers at this point. That is on the banking side. It's on the merchant side and here coming in with a solution that provides the right offer through the right channel at the right time to drive through that clutter.We have the #1 personalization company that we acquired 2 years ago. That is one of the drivers we expect some big growth there. You look at the other hand on the Cyber & Security solutions, digital identity. An authentication solution today, nobody likes passwords, you're in a situation where you have to end up making trade-offs between simplicity and security when it comes to digital payments and with our technology, we find ways to go around that effectively, driving down fraud at the same time, ensure that there's low abandonment rates.So biometric solutions, I talked about them earlier, is one of those examples. So across these 2 portfolios, C&I and DNS, cyber analytics and data insights, that's where we see the big growth and the big demand. Other solutions, real-time payments, we have a strong position there. We talked about this a couple of quarters ago, where we said we are in the markets in which we are, and we're driving the scale volumes and the reference to our strategic partnership with TCH to show that we continue on that front. So those are kind of the key drivers that we see here. We feel this is a uniquely differentiated portfolio, and that's in great demand."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Kennedy with William Blair.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'And you just talked about it, can you give a broader update on your digital identity solutions and what your strategy is for that and how it can ultimately impact your business?', 'Michael Miebach', ""Right. So let me do that. I just gave you the headlines on that. So specifically, within that, there's a whole set of solutions from biometric to identity events where we have an ability to provide an identity confidence score to one of our customers and saying, this person has lived at the address before and here is their previous employment. So with this -- with a certain level of confidence we can say this is the person. All this stuff is kind of happening behind the scenes. That is the approach that we're taking. But it's not just our identity data. We are combining this with open banking. We're trying to find use cases where this really makes a difference. For example, an account opening. So we're taking our open banking technology in our Finicity footprint here in the United States, all the way up to 90% of our deposit accounts in this market.And we're taking our digital identity solution into a premium account owner verification and account opening solution. Those are the kind of examples where we see we're truly differentiated. At the highest level, it's before and after the transaction, we're driving value through digital identity. We feel this is absolutely central to the digital economy. And that's why we put it in the new network because there are people who have identity data and there are people who want to use identity data. We don't want to hold it. We're sitting somewhere in the middle, and we are essentially the trusted partner that can prove one way or another if a person is the person they claim to be. Minimal use of data, permission data that's (inaudible)."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital.', 'Paul Alexander Golding', ""I guess to touch on Finicity since you just mentioned it, Michael. Do you see this evolving more so as a value-added service and solution driver or a volume driver now that you've had it in the portfolio for some time? And then as a follow-on, I just wanted to see if we could get some more color on the acceptance location growth from a regional perspective, given the strength in international volumes in the period."", 'Michael Miebach', ""Right. So starting with Finicity and then we have the corresponding set of capabilities through our IA acquisition in Europe. We're also building out connectivity in Australia. Those are the 3 regions where we're focused. And open banking does a number of things. Essentially, what we see is a set of use cases here that rise to the top and everything that you could do with open banking. In the end, there's this big vision about OpenData, where people can use their data footprint. Small businesses can use the data footprint for getting access to better services. But for now, what's really rising at the top is account opening, the example that I already gave. Open Banking for payments, I come to that for a moment -- in a moment, open banking for lending and for small business in particular. So those are kind of the 3 categories that we feel are particularly relevant right now for payments, it's really interesting, to your point, is this a volume driver? It could because the connectivity that we have here, what we're trying to do is facilitate payments, for example, in non-carded use cases as we have the pay by bank solution in the United States in partnership with Chase bank. So we hope to see significant volume growth out of that. That's the whole idea. And that builds on our experience with Pay-by-Bank in the U.K. This is a somewhat different approach here in the U.S. where our open banking capabilities are the true differentiators. So use cases that matter. That's the focus. And out of that, we hope to see not only API clicks on account opening, but also payment volume coming through. Sorry. That was a second part of the question. My team is just reminding me. Acceptance growth regionally. I mean it comes to the answer actually that Sachin gave earlier where we talked a little bit about payments growth and the regional comparison. So when you think beyond the United States, we see a tremendous growth opportunity. Here in the United States, you would say it's more new use cases and verticals, and it's more generally and broader acceptance across the payments landscape in the rest of the world. There's even significant geographic opportunities to grow. Take Japan, for example. So it's a country that is what the government has put out a stated policy to drive a cashless Japan. So tremendous upside there. We talked about China earlier on, where we're investing heavily in acceptance footprint. So I would say it's leaning a little more on the international side, but here in the U.S., we're very busy going for use cases and verticals."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore.', 'David Mark Togut', 'Europe continues to be a driver of differentiated growth for Mastercard. Could you share your insights into your runway for growth in some of your largest countries, for example, Germany and Italy and maybe frame that in terms of payment volume growth and vast growth opportunity.', 'Michael Miebach', ""Let me start off with that question. First of all, I do want to underline what you just said. It is a source of differentiated growth for us. We've had a great run in Europe. And it's a combination of share growth, but it's also driven by the ways that we find to go after the accelerated secular shift that we saw on the back end of COVID. Countries like Germany really driving up contactless usage, just to give you one example. So overall, Europe has been firing on all cylinders for us. And I come back to the growth algorithm that we laid out for payments, which applies very much in Europe. So European economies will do what they do, but we will continue to focus on share gain, but we will also be very busy to take the share gains that we've already had and turn that into profitable volume for us. Conversions driving that. We had a question on that earlier. So that's driver #1. And then going into new flows in Europe, there is opportunity there as well. If you look at alternative payment systems, everything that's going on in Europe, clearly, through PSD2, PSD3 and so forth, there's a lot of movement in Europe that we will stay on top as we look ahead into that. Differentiated assets in bill pay in the Nordics and so forth. So we have a pretty broad footprint to participate in all the drivers in Europe. In terms of Services, the services has been strong in Europe for a long time. Our advisers on our consulting business has been a winner for us in Europe for the longest time. And if you look at some of these big wins, that we've talked about, they all have a significant contribution of services. In fact, I would say, oftentimes, they are one of the reasons that we win those deals. So nothing dramatically different there. I think Europe has caught up on secular trend in digitization and we're firing on all cylinders. We have -- we're fully invested in Europe. As you know, one of the big topics in Europe is European sovereignty, and we are deeply invested in Europe with our efforts, and we're engaging with -- in Brussels in the nation-state and so forth, which is very important for us to do to be a partner on their journey."", 'Sachin Mehra', ""Yes. David, it's Sachin. I'll just emphasize what Michael just said, right? He mentioned on a couple of occasions today that payment stripes value-add service and solutions and value-added service and solutions drive payments. It's no different in Europe, right? For all the share wins we've had in Europe for all the growth we're seeing on the payment side, it creates new opportunities for us on the services side. And then vice versa, as you actually do deliver on those services, you get the benefit of additional data when you get the benefit of additional data, we were able to help optimize existing portfolios, which again drives payment volume growth. And that's not unique to Europe. It's actually true for the way we run the business globally. But the fact that we are actually increasingly becoming more prominent in the payment flow enables that cycle to work quite effectively."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ken Kenneth Suchoski with Autonomous Research.', 'Kenneth Christopher Suchoski', ""I just wanted to ask about the yields on the domestic assessment revenue line. That yield has declined year-over-year for some time now, and they came in a little bit lighter than some were expecting this quarter. I think you highlighted mix impacting the yields or the spread between revenue and volume growth. So could you just provide some more detail around the specific changes that you're seeing in terms of mix? And could we get to a place where domestic yields are actually expanding year-over-year?"", 'Sachin Mehra', ""Look, I mean, I'll comment on the Europe piece because what you're seeing effectively in the fourth quarter of 2023, when you look at payment network net revenue divided by GDV is what you see every year in terms of the sequential decline in yields. And that's primarily being driven by the fact that remember, in the third quarter of all years, we tend to have our strongest cross-border performance. And our cross-border tends to come with our best yields. And so what you've got is when you're getting more bang for the buck for $1 of GDV on the cross-border side than you are on the domestic volume side. So that's what's causing for that sequential decline. You'll see that as a pattern, which has existed in prior years as well. Broadly speaking, I would tell you that, otherwise, there's nothing unusual to call out on the payment network net revenue yield. The one reminder I'll give you is that, we run the business not only to optimize payment network, net revenue yield, but overall net revenue yield for our company. Because again, it goes back to the question David asked right before you can, which is at the end of the day, we've got to be in the payment flow. We've got to allow ourselves to have the opportunity to deliver services on those payments to generate additional revenue, which causes for overall net accretion in our overall net revenue yield. So I know your question is specific to payment network net revenue yield, but I just wanted to make sure you know that from our mindset standpoint, we're looking at payment network net revenue yield as well as overall net revenue yield to the company."", 'Michael Miebach', ""I should say, earlier when I was talking about the payment algorithm, I said that we are putting great focus on our financial discipline. And we do it with revenues in mind and with services revenue in mind. So yes, it needs to add up to the overall net revenue yield, as Sachin just said. But I'm telling you, we don't want to win every deal. We want to win the deals we want to win, and we're pretty disciplined about it."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.', 'Andrew William Jeffrey', ""I wanted to dig in, Michael, if I'm at a little bit more on your Pay-by-Bank initiatives. Can this be especially as we see the emergence of networks like Pix in Brazil, for example, can this be sort of a stand-alone growth driver in its own right? Or is it sort of folded into your overall comments on open banking. I just wanted to see if there's an important distinction to draw as we think about go-forward growth opportunities."", 'Michael Miebach', ""Right. So I think both questions, your question and the previous question hit on an important point there. There is a particular point of interest for us at the intersection of open banking and payments. It enables the -- open banking connectivity enables us to go after use cases that we otherwise wouldn't be able to go after. So here's additional data that is available that you can then combine in combination with an underlying RTP rail to make a profitable proposition for a customer, which is exactly what Chase Pay-by-Bank is, basically, you debit your customer when there's a balance, and that is what the open banking connectivity tells you. So that's a good solution.If we look broadly around the world. Pix, UPI in India, FedNow, there's a bunch of real-time payment systems. And those are the kind of rails where we have experience. We have connectivity. In some we operate them ourselves. So that is exactly what we're looking at as one of the assets and the propositions that we will bring together for our customers. Now more broadly speaking, when you look at Pix, when you look at UPI, one other thing to keep in mind is, here's public sector doing a good job in pulling in more participants in the overall digital economy so we can come in with our solutions, our real-time payment solutions, our card-based solutions, but they're basically extending the digital economy to create a tide that kind of lifts everybody's boats, financial inclusion being the headline. So that's something to consider. Somewhere in between, there are points that we will manage very carefully as in when these systems grow and they provide alternatives to our solutions that we compete and provide the best solution to consumers and to our customers. On the fraud side, on ease of use, a lot of these systems don't have all of these functionalities. So those are things that we focus on. So we're focused on providing the best choice to our customers. We don't mind the competition, but we actually see quite a bit of opportunity for us to use these rails for the open banking type of solution that you just asked about. So interesting space, and it drives the overall economic growth -- digital economy growth."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies.', 'Trevor Ellis Williams', ""Sachin, I was just hoping you could put a finer point on the growth algorithm within the full year revenue outlook. I know you mentioned some of the cadence dynamics with VAS and currency vault, but any help on what you're assuming for volume and transaction growth relative to the January trends, rebates and incentives, pricing. Any help on those would be great."", 'Sachin Mehra', ""So look, I'm not going to give you a specific kind of forecast as it relates to what we're assuming from a driver standpoint. We've kind of shared with you what our base case is. And the base case continues to assume that the consumer spending remains healthy, and we're reflecting in the current spending dynamics. From an overall kind of volumes and transaction standpoint. I think to your question on pricing, it's no different than it's been in the past. We always price based on the value we deliver to our customers. And we will continue to do that wherever it makes sense across the globe. And we kind of have new things which we're launching, there's new value we're delivering to our customers. And as we do that, we'll continue to price for that.On specifically the Contra question. I think the -- the important thing to note on Contra is that at the end of the day, Contra is enabling volume growth, right? We pay incentives and rebates to our customers to bring more volume onto our network. And as we do that, we're paying for that. For the first quarter, we expect our Contra as a percentage of our payment network assessments to be roughly similar to what you saw in Q4 of 2023. I would tell you, on a full year basis, it's going to be entirely a function of how we see deals play out, what the pipeline is. Obviously, we know what the outlook is from a pipeline standpoint. Some of that will come to fruition. Some of that will not. There'll be other things, which will move in and out. And so I'm not going to kind of share with you what the full year outlook is on Contra, but for Q1, I can kind of give you my thoughts, which are we expect that Contra as a percentage of payment network assessments will be roughly similar to what we saw in Q4 of 2023."", 'Michael Miebach', 'We have time for just 1 more, Brianna.', 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.', 'Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar', ""I appreciate all the comments so far. My question is on real-time payments. And Michael, you did have some incremental comments there on TCH, but saw the TCH renewal. Obviously, you have a global set of capabilities here. My question is, what's the runway and what drives it? Is it the use cases rather than more countries? And then if it is use cases, what are some of the use cases that you see coming up that are exciting from a conversion perspective?"", 'Michael Miebach', ""Right. So first of all, the strategic relationship here in the U.S. with the Clearinghouse is important to note. Back when in 2016, '17, real-time payments really took off. This is when we invested in VocaLink and VocaLink was a partner with the Clearinghouse at the time. So a strong and more strategic renewal here is a big statement, and it speaks to our position in real-time payments. 10 out of the top 50 GDP countries, we either operate are providing software and services to the real-time payment system. So it's real. It's there as the name indicates, and it's carrying a lot of volume for us in itself. That's an interesting business but it's much more than that. It's much more than that as we're talking to various players, including ones that I mentioned about new applications that come on top of that, coming right back to the Chase Pay-by-Bank example, here is access to rails on one hand and then a set of additional data that turns a simple payment that gets money from A to B to something that's a value-add payment. That is where we're going to go. And these use cases will play out in a somewhat different way. It is obviously always our interest to find global solutions, but it's also -- this is a rather more geographic specifically driven space. So we'll have to see where that all lands. So we keep that in mind, which is why we're not driving into many more markets right now. We're the most critical markets and here we're staying very close to where that is going. But it's applications and it's scaling volumes in the markets that we're in, it's where the focus is."", 'Devin Corr', 'Thank you, Mark, on your last comment...', 'Michael Miebach', ""Well, as always, thank you for your support to Mastercard. Thank you for listening to Sachin and me, and thank you to everybody at Mastercard for making all this work. We'll speak to you in one quarter. it's also unusual to note this is on a Wednesday today. I don't think we ever had that before. Certainly, for me, this is the first Wednesday. We'll see how we mix it up next time. Speak to you in a quarter. Thank you, and bye-bye."", 'Sachin Mehra', 'Thanks, everyone.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.""]"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our chief executive officer; and Sachin Mehra, our chief financial officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session.', 'It is only then, that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, Michael Miebach.', 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. Here's the headline. We closed out 2023 with another quarter of strong earnings and revenue growth."", ""Quarter 4 net revenues were up 11%, and operating income up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items as always. These results were driven by healthy consumer spending and the ongoing execution of our strategy. Our deal momentum continued this quarter, powered by a broad range of unique diversified products and services both designed to solve our customers' needs. Let's start on the macroeconomic front, where we see both tailwinds and headwinds."", ""First, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and rising wages. These remain key drivers of consumer spending. Some risks we're monitoring include credit availability and delinquency rates. Second, while inflation continues to moderate, prices of many goods and services remain elevated."", ""We're tracking the efforts of central banks who are actively managing interest rates to normalize inflation. And finally, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern in several markets. On balance, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook, but we are monitoring the environment closely, and we'll manage the business accordingly. Looking at our switch trends this quarter, domestic volume growth remains healthy, and cross-border spending remains strong, up 18% globally in the fourth quarter on a local-currency basis."", 'With that as a backdrop, we remain focused on our strategic priorities which fuel our growth algorithm across payments and services and new networks. In payments, our growth algorithm consists of five key areas. One, being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies. Two, accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments across both spend and transactions.', ""Three, further penetrating the addressable market in new flows. And four, growing market share. And five, optimizing our customer portfolios for performance. Economies are growing, and that's not in our control."", 'However, we are executing on the rest. Building on that, the runway for the secular shift is substantial. We are accelerating it by scaling acceptance, enhancing the user experience for digital transactions, and driving adoption in new sectors and new use cases. In 2023, we added millions of new acceptance locations worldwide.', ""This growth has been aided by scaling our tap on phone and cloud commerce capabilities. We're now live in over 18 markets. Smaller merchants can start accepting payments by simply downloading an app, and larger merchants are leveraging the technology to promote quick and seamless checkout experiences anywhere in store. We're supporting partners like Apple, who in 2023, expanded tap to pay on iPhone into Australia, the U.K., France, Brazil, and several other markets."", ""We're also accelerating the secular shift away from both from cash and closed-loop transactions such as transit through our contactless capabilities. Contactless provides a fast, secure, and seamless consumer experience in areas like transit, which creates an opportunity to capture incremental transactions with a tap for every single ride. And when consumers use contactless for transit, they often extend that behavior across other low-dollar-spend categories. We've made great progress with many major cities such as London and New York, operating broad-based open-loop systems."", ""However, there's still significant runway for us given that only a small percentage of large cities globally are operating open-loop systems at scale. And we're leaning into advanced payment technologies like Click to Pay, tokenization, and biometrics. They offer embedded, secure, and password-free checkout solutions and with that bring an elevated level of security, simplicity, and speed to every transaction. And that's true regardless of the device, browser, or card."", 'These solutions not only benefit consumers, but they also create value for merchants as their customers are less likely to abandon a transaction and issuers also benefit from an increase in customer stickiness. For Click to Pay, we are now live in over 35 countries, supported by over 50 channel partners. And in 2023, we drove over 60% growth in transactions. Klarna will implement Click to Pay this year and activate their merchants across all European markets where they operate.', ""We're driving tokenization across all channels including devices, commerce platforms, card on file, and guest checkout. Tokenization reduces fraud and increases approval rates by approximately 3 to 6 percentage points across regions. And we're expanding our biometric payment capabilities, which enable payments with a smile or a wave. After launching in Brazil, we have now partnered with NEC Corporation to bring our biometric checkout to the Asia-Pacific region."", ""We're also driving growth by winning and retaining deals across consumer payments, account to account, and new flows. This week, we shared that BOK Financial will flip its U.S. debit portfolio to Mastercard, making us the exclusive partner across its debit and commercial portfolios. They selected us due to our differentiated virtual card and open banking assets fraud solutions and our shared commitment to financial inclusion."", 'This marks the third U.S. regulated debit flip we signed in the last year building on our recent successes with Citizens and Webster Bank, both of which have now started converting their portfolios. And BPER Banca, one of the largest banks in Italy, will migrate their debit card portfolio to Mastercard as well. We renewed our partnership with Commonwealth Bank of Australia where we will retain exclusivity across their consumer credit and debit portfolios.', ""We signed a long-term partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in Korea, to solidify our leadership in the country. This relationship spans consumer and commercial card offerings and expands into new services including data analytics. And in Canada, we executed an exclusive long-term renewal of the President's Choice Financial consumer credit and prepaid portfolios. We're also winning in fintechs, co-brands and public sector partners."", 'When it comes to fintechs, Mastercard is a partner of choice. In fact, Mastercard serves over 80% of the top digital payment and neobank fintechs on the CNBC Global Fintech list. This quarter, Starling Bank, one of the largest fintechs in the U.K. renewed their partnership with Mastercard.', ""In the co-brand space, we're partnering with J. Crew and Synchrony in the U.S. to launch the retailer's first co-branded digital first card. And in the public sector, we have an exclusive partnership with Fiserv Money Network for all U.S."", 'state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. As part of our partnership, we are thrilled to launch with the California Economic Development Department in February, the largest unemployment program in the United States. As you can see, we continue our positive deal momentum powered by our differentiated products and services, while always keeping a focus on financial discipline. This also helps us to capture more of the secular tailwind and, in turn, further drive services growth.', ""Looking to China, we are thrilled that our joint venture in China has released formal approval to commence domestic bankcard clearing. Believe that we will be uniquely positioned to provide Chinese consumers with an exceptional payment experience using a single card that's optimized for both domestic and cross-border spend. While we're excited about the medium to long-term opportunity, there's still work to be done as we fully build out the issuing and acceptance footprint. As we do that, we continue to grow our presence with bank and fintech partners in the market."", 'ICBC launched the first world Mastercard product in November and Bank of Communications selected Mastercard to launch their first international debit card. Beyond cards, we also continue to make meaningful progress in the account-to-account space. This quarter, we announced a long-term strategic partnership with The Clearing House, the operator of the RTP network, which continues to secure our position in real time payments in the United States. Now, shifting gears, we continue to execute against our strategy to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new flows including commercial payments and disbursements and remittances.', 'We continue to win in commercial. This spans commercial point of sale and B2B accounts payable, which we target through our market-leading virtual card solution. This quarter alone we renewed our commercial relationships with JPMorgan and FLEETCOR, two of the largest commercial issuers in the United States. BNP Paribas Fortis will flip their business credit portfolio to Mastercard in Belgium.', 'And on the virtual card front, we announced two exciting partnerships in the online travel agency space with Booking.com and Agoda. Turning now to disbursements and remittances. In 2023, we grew transactions by over 30%. We continue to scale our use cases.', 'For example UBS has integrated our cross-border services capability. This will enable them to execute instant cross-border payments from multiple use cases, including helping their customers pay employees abroad. In addition, we also partnered with Alipay to establish them as a cross-border payments receiving institution in China. Payments, services, and new networks reinforce each other.', 'We said it countless times. Our services and new networks provide differentiation as noted in many of the wins I mentioned. Underlying payments growth helps drive services too, and payments growth brings incremental rich data. Our services turn that data into valuable insights.', 'And when implemented by our customers, those insights can drive incremental digitization of payments. In turn, this generates even more data, more transactions, more need for fraud tools, and the powerful cycle continues. The services and new networks components of our growth algorithms are built on, driving increased penetration of existing customers, extending our services across new customers and customer types and continuing to build and deploy new services. Here are a few examples how we are executing against each of these.', 'The past year, Bank of America has expanded their services relationship with us to include test and learn program management and supplier enablement solutions. This is on top of many of our services they already have. Axis Bank in India has also expanded their relationship with us. They will use our consulting, marketing and analytics services to support end-to-end portfolio lifecycle management.', 'Worldpay is utilizing our fraud alerts to streamline the dispute resolution process. And Citi has deployed consumer clarity digital receipts to provide eligible U.S. cardholders with detailed purchase information directly to their bank app. Now, with increased visibility about the merchant and purchase details, consumers can easily validate transactions and reduce the number of disputes they file.', ""Square is also integrating consumer clarity solution. Furthermore, Nexi has chose Mastercard as a strategic partner to rollout open banking for e-commerce payments across Europe and the list goes on. We're extending our services and solutions across new customer types including large marketplaces. Alibaba will use Mastercard's open banking technology to help streamline the onboarding experience for small businesses on the U.S."", 'marketplace and reduce fraud. And Meta utilizes our digital identity technology to improve authentication for online orders. We also continue to develop new services and solutions, many of which leverage the work we are doing with Generative AI. Generative AI brings more opportunity to drive better experiences for our customers, and makes it easier to extract insights from our data.', ""It can also help us increase internal productivity. We're working on many GenAI use cases today to do just that. For example, we recently announced Shopping Muse. Shopping Muse uses Generative AI to offer a conversational shopping tool that recreates the in-store human experience online, can translate consumers' colloquial language into tailored recommendations."", 'Another example is Mastercard Small Business AI. The tool will draw on our existing small business resources along with the content from a newly formed global media coalition to help business owners navigate a range of business challenges. The platform, which is scheduled for pilot launch later this year, will leverage AI to provide personalized real-time assistance delivered in a conversational tone. And finally, we expanded Mastercard Access, which provides customers with a single point of connectivity to quickly and easily source our AI digital and identity services.', 'Using access customers can deploy these services across multiple rails or networks including those outside the Mastercard network. This is an exciting development, which enhances our ability to scale our services across networks and streamlines the ability for our customers to adopt our capabilities. So, with that, I will wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter and year of revenue and earnings growth.', ""We're successfully executing against our strategy and on our growth algorithm. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model, and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you."", 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Michael. Turning now to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions.', 'And operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased by 15% and 18%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a non-recurring tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter. EPS was $3.18, which includes an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.8 billion worth of stock and an additional 586 million through January 26, 2024.', ""So, let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 10% year over year on a local-currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 4% with credit growth of 5% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13% with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 12%."", 'Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the NatWest portfolio migration in the UK. Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter on a local-currency basis, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q3, this is primarily due to tougher comps as we continue to lap the cross-border travel recovery from last year. Turning to Page 5.', 'Switched transactions grew 12% year over year in Q4, both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 65% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.', 'Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the fourth quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 17%, primarily driven by strong growth in our cyber and intelligence solutions, driven by the growth in our underlying drivers and the continued scaling of our fraud and security solutions and our identity and authentication solutions. In addition, we saw strong growth in our marketing, data analytics, and consulting services as well as our loyalty solutions.', ""This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions. Now, let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric. Domestic assessments were up 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 10%."", 'The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 21%, while cross-border volumes increased 18%. The 3 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 10%, while switched transactions grew 12%.', 'The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments were 251 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation, and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8.', 'You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives and increased spending on marketing campaigns, advertising, and sponsorships like the UEFA Champions League and the Rugby World Cup. Turning to Page 9, you will see that we are no longer providing operating metrics as a percentage of 2019 given that we are well past the pandemic. Now, let me comment on the operating metric trends in the fourth quarter and through the first four weeks of January.', 'Starting with switch volume growth year over year. The sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 is primarily due to the lapping effects from the routing of all Mastercard branded volume in Japan to the Mastercard switch and the migration of the NatWest portfolio to Mastercard. Specific to the U.S., the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 was primarily due to tougher comps. Moving to the first four weeks of January, switched volume growth in the U.S.', 'was impacted primarily by severe weather events across the country. As we look specifically at the fourth week of January, which did not have the same impacts from severe weather, switched volume in the U.S. returned to approximately 5% growth year over year, similar to what we saw in December. Outside of the U.S., we continue to lap the migration of the NatWest portfolio.', 'Switch transactions follow similar patterns to switched volumes. Looking at cross-border for both Q4 and the first four weeks of January, cross-border travel growth continues to be primarily impacted by tougher comps as we lap the recovery of travel. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to show strength. Turning now to Page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts on fiscal year 2024.', 'Let me start by saying our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to grow through a combination of healthy consumer spending, new and renewed customer agreements, continued secular shift from cash to card, and strong growth across our service offerings. In short, as Michael said, we are executing on our strategy and realizing the benefits from our growth algorithm. Overall, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook.', 'Consumer spending continues to be supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Our base case scenario for 2024 reflects healthy consumer spending and recent spending dynamics. That being said, we are closely monitoring both positives and negatives in the macro environment as well as geopolitical events, and we stand ready to manage our investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. As it relates to the full-year 2024, our base case is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions.', 'Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. In terms of operating expenses, we expect full-year growth at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Of note, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt in operating expense due to a new Brazil tax legislation, which went into effect as of January 1, 2024. This legislation results in higher operating expenses due to an increase in indirect taxes, which is more than offset by a reduction in our income taxes expense.', 'Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the year. Now, turning to Q1 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the quarter.', 'Let me briefly talk through why our full year currency-neutral net revenue growth is expected to be higher than the first quarter of 2024. This is primarily driven by two factors: First, revenues related to FX volatility were highest in Q1 2023 compared to the other quarters in the year; and second, while our value-added services and solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace, from a cadence perspective, we expect Q1 growth to be lower relative to the other quarters, primarily due to tougher comps. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Once again, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier.', 'Acquisitions are forecasted to add 0 to 1 ppt to this opex growth and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we expect an expense of approximately 60 million to 65 million for Q1, given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics.', 'Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17% for Q1 and approximately 17% on a full-year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. This reflects the benefit to our effective tax rate related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.', 'Devin Corr -- Head of Investor Relations', 'Thank you. Briana, you may open the call for questions now.', '', 'Operator', ""[Operator instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open."", 'Harshita Rawat -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""Hi, good morning. I want to ask about U.S. card volumes. So, weather aside, the growth has decelerated a bit to mid single-digit levels versus what we've seen in the last five to ten years, especially if you compare that to PC."", ""So, how should we think about kind of a normalized card volume growth in the U.S? Or is there simply more runway, a number of transactions. So, that's the metric we should be watching? And also, just as a follow-up, can you also comment on Reg II impact on U.S. bonds? Thank you."", 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure, Harshita. Let me take those questions. First, on Reg II, let me just kind of share with everybody that from a Reg II standpoint, we haven't seen any material impact come through as far as what we've seen so far on the data. Obviously, we will keep a close eye on it as the year progresses, but nothing to actually report from any sort of material impact."", ""On your question around U.S. card volume growth. Look, at the end of the day, here's the way we think about it, right? We continue to believe that in the U.S., there remains a decent amount of secular opportunity, both from a volume standpoint and from a transaction growth standpoint. In addition to that, as you know, business models are evolving, spending behaviors are changing, and that creates greater opportunity from a volume and a transaction standpoint."", ""But more specifically, what I'd tell you is the following, which is in the release of the U.S. We've got to kind of think about what's going on with PCE and what the impact of inflation is in the PCE numbers relative to where it's taking place, i.e., is it taking place in carded volumes? Or is it taking place in non-carded categories of spend? So, as you do the analysis, at least as we do the analysis, the way we think about this is, we look at PCE, we think about, on a normalized basis, if inflation were to take place fairly evenly across both carded and non-carded PCE, it gives us a high degree of comfort that there's a decent amount of secular opportunity, which still remains in the U.S. from a growth standpoint. Now, in addition to the secular opportunity and the fact that the U.S."", ""continues to actually perform well from an overall consumer health standpoint, we're very active. We're growing our volumes by winning share. I mean you've heard about this quarter over quarter in terms of what we're doing to win volumes from new customers. We've had good wins on the debit space, which, as you know, is a challenged kind of environment in the U.S."", ""So, overall, I tell you from the U.S. standpoint, it continues to be a very important market, one which is going to be a decent contributor to our growth, driven by the PCE growth component, the secular shift as well as share. And again, what I'm talking about is, on the card payment volume side of the business."", 'Harshita Rawat -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Perfect. Thank you.', 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Your line is open.', 'Craig Maurer -- Financial Technology Partners -- Analyst', ""Yeah, good morning. Thanks. So, two questions. One, to what degree are conversions of new wins contributing to fiscal year '24 guidance? And secondly, regarding China, knowing that you need to launch your business there within six months of approval, I was wondering if you could characterize conversations with issuers there and whether you've been able to keep warm relationships with those issuers over the years, considering you're in a very strong position in China when regulations changed, whatever it was seven, eight years ago? Thanks."", 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Right. Let me take the China question first, and we come back to the conversion topic that you raised. So, needless to say, we're thrilled about China. So, this is a -- it's a massive economy, and we feel we're well positioned to serve it."", ""As I said in my remarks at the beginning, we feel we're uniquely positioned to put into the hand of Chinese consumers a solution -- a seamless solution that works domestically as well as when they travel. That's not unique. There's another competitor that has that kind of a proposition. But we do have the much better acceptance network to provide an end-to-end solution that works well."", ""On that basis, we're busy right now with our partners in China with the banks with acquirers, issuers and so forth, to discuss rolling out on the issuing side as well as on the acceptance side for six months as you rightly said. Now, for years, we have been very active in China on the cross-border side. And those are strong relationships with the same exact banks. And we're just -- I mentioned too, with ICBC and Bank of Communications, we're just launching new products."", ""So, the fact that we are well positioned today with the banks gives us an edge here on moving forward at speed. As I also said, going live within the first six months doesn't mean that we're live everywhere, and we have to build this out over time to get full opportunity in the medium to the long term. And on the conversion piece, just to know, for the U.S., we saw -- I mentioned this earlier for Webster and for Citizens, conversion is starting. Some of the big conversions in Europe have already completed."", ""Sachin talked about the lapping for NatWest and so forth. So, Sachin, if there's anything else."", 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Craig, I would just add, like Michael said, right? I mean, as you would imagine, in terms of how we think about 2024 and our thoughts for 2024, we do factor in what our best estimate as it relates to the conversion of the portfolios. What I'd tell you is, we've had a decent amount of wins across the globe. We for the most part, the sizable ones are staggered wins, as in they come on over a period of time."", ""They're not episodic flips, which will take place all at one time. So, for example, Citizens, Webster, UniCredit, Deutsche Bank, all of these will play out over the course of '24 and in some instances, over multiple years. So, we factor in our best estimates on those conversions as we kind of put our thoughts together for the year."", 'Craig Maurer -- Financial Technology Partners -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.', 'Sanjay Sakhrani -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Thank you. Good morning. Sachin, thank you for sort of cadence for the year with the first quarter. But I was just wondering, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the expectations for payments versus the value-added service revenues? And then specific to that Brazil tax legislation.', 'I guess, is it neutral to EPS? It adds to opex, but lower taxes? Just maybe you could help us with that, too. Thank you.', 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Let me just take the Brazil one first, and I'll come back to your second question. So, on the Brazil piece, it increases our operating expenses because it's an increase in indirect taxes, which are there. That is a -- it's more than offset in our tax rate and in the thoughts we've given you from a tax rate standpoint."", ""So, from an overall EPS standpoint, it actually ends up being slightly accretive because of the more than offset, which is taking place on the tax line there. On your question around payments versus value-added services and solutions expectations, look, we're not giving specific guidance as it relates to how we see payment network revenue and value-added services and solutions revenue. But at the high level, here's what I'd say. Let me first address the value-added services and solutions piece."", ""We continue to see good growth in our solutions around everything around our fraud and security solutions, our data analytics and insights, and we're building all of those into our thoughts for the year. We've had a good year in 2023. We continue to see a good outlook for value-services and solutions going into 2024. Likewise, for payments, right? I mean, as you can imagine, in payments, it's a function of what we think will happen from a carded market volume growth rate standpoint and what the impacts will be from share wins as well as the impacts of rebates and incentives."", 'So, all of that kind of is factored in. What I would tell you broadly is that we continue to expect value-added services and solutions to grow at a faster pace than we do on the payment network side.', 'Sanjay Sakhrani -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.', 'Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Hey, thank you. Good morning. Thanks for all the detail here. Just thinking about the outlook.', ""I think Harshita to ask it as well, just the outlook for growth between the U.S. and rest of world. Any -- anything to call out there? Do you expect the trends observed in '23 to be different in 2024 here between the two regions? Thanks."", 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Tien-Tsin, honestly, I would tell you from a secular opportunity standpoint, right? I mean, we continue to believe, broadly speaking, the secular opportunity is greater outside of the U.S. than it is in the U.S. There's a good news, bad news story there."", ""And the good news is that, that means we've been quite successful in driving the secular shift opportunity in the U.S., which is what you're seeing in the results come through. And again, from a bad news standpoint is there's a lower remaining opportunity on the volume side in the U.S. But if you ask me the question on a year-over-year basis, I would tell you, I don't expect any meaningful shift in terms of suddenly the trajectory of how the secular opportunity is being realized between the U.S. and the rest of the world to be changing between '23 and '24."", 'Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Very clear. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.', 'Dan Perlin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Good morning. I heard you call out a couple of times geopolitical concerns, and I know that there's some, I don't know, 30 or 40 different elections happening around the globe. So, my question to you is, as you think about managing those potential concerns, are there certain regions where you feel like there could be pockets of more nationalistic behavior, which would be problematic for you guys getting into those markets? Or that because of election years historically, what you've seen are that it kind of slows down adoption and some of the secular trends that you would have otherwise been able to enjoy in maybe a non-election year? So, just trying to handicap what maybe some of those positives and negatives could be just geopolitically this year."", 'Thanks.', 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Right. Dan, you just touched on some of the key things to watch out for. But this is no different than us monitoring fiscal monetary policy reactions by central banks and governments. So, those are all things that affect consumer sentiment, potentially affect consumer spending.', ""So, we'll just have to stay close to what that is. Our discipline around these things is to do some solid scenario planning and making sure our playbook in terms of managing our financial responsibility responsibly is up to date. Certainly, the last three years have had no shortages of such challenges, and we adapted quickly. More specifically to the points that you mentioned, elections happen regularly."", ""So, there is nothing dramatically new in 2024. And geopolitical conflicts, they've been around, and they keep going. And that is something we'll watch what is the impact on energy prices and various downstream into the broader economy. Yet again, our economics Institute is keeping a focus on that."", ""So, nothing very specific. That's why we kept it relatively high level. But these days, one has to just take a look left and right all the time."", 'Dan Perlin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Understood. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.', 'Darrin Peller -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys. Thanks. It's good to see the value-add services and solutions accelerate, maybe going back to 17% from 14%. Maybe you could just revisit that for a minute in terms of -- I know you sounded confident that, that should sustain strong growth relative to the business."", ""And so, maybe just revisit the drivers of that and what gives you the confidence that sustains? And really just overall, what's the -- what's -- if you sort of rank the top items in that category? Thanks."", 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', 'All right. So, let me kick off on that. If you split out the value-added services here, you have our other services, which Sachin touched on earlier, for example, our real-time payment assets and things like that. The thing that we have historically focused on here in this space is our cyber and intelligence solutions, fraud solutions, and the data insights, and analytics solutions.', 'So, if you think about how that flywheel talks about, I talked about the powerful cycle earlier on. So, more payments that need to be kept safe, more payments throughout more data, which drive more data analytics inside. That is the underlying kind of secular trend, which is pretty closely related to the secular shift as well. So, that is the baseline of growth here.', 'And then you look at some of the more specific growth drivers here. For example, in data analytics, in that group, we also have our personalization solution. So, everybody is trying to engage their consumers at this point. That is on the banking side.', ""It's on the merchant side and here coming in with a solution that provides the right offer through the right channel at the right time to drive through that clutter. We have the No. 1 personalization company that we acquired two years ago. That is one of the drivers we expect some big growth there."", ""You look at the other hand on the cyber and security solutions, digital identity. An authentication solution today, nobody likes passwords. You're in a situation where you have to end up making trade-offs between simplicity and security when it comes to digital payments. And with our technology, we find ways to go around that effectively, driving down fraud, at the same time, ensure that there's low abandonment rates."", ""So, biometric solutions, I talked about them earlier, is one of those examples. So, across these two portfolios, C&I and DNS, cyber analytics and data insights, that's where we see the big growth and the big demand. Other solutions, real-time payments, we have a strong position there. We talked about this a couple of quarters ago, where we said we are in the markets in which we are, and we're driving the scale volumes and the reference to our strategic partnership with TCH to show that we continue on that front."", ""So, those are kind of the key drivers that we see here. We feel this is a uniquely differentiated portfolio, and that's in great demand."", 'Darrin Peller -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""That's helpful. Thanks, guys."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Cris Kennedy with William Blair. Your line is open.', 'Cris Kennedy -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And you just talked about it.', 'But can you give a broader update on your digital identity solutions and what your strategy is for that and how it can ultimately impact your business? Thank you.', 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Right. So, let me do that. I just gave you the headlines on that. So, specifically, within that, there's a whole set of solutions from biometric to identity events where we have an ability to provide an identity confidence score to one of our customers and saying, this person has lived at the address before, and here is their previous employment."", ""So, with this -- with a certain level of confidence, we can say, this is the person. All this stuff is kind of happening behind the scenes. That is the approach that we're taking. But it's not just our identity data."", ""We are combining this with open banking. We're trying to find use cases where this really makes a difference. For example, an account opening. So, we're taking our open banking technology in our Finicity footprint here in the United States, all the way up to 90% of our deposit accounts in this market."", ""And we're taking our digital identity solution into a premium account owner verification and account opening solution. Those are the kind of examples where we see we're truly differentiated. At the highest level, it's before and after the transaction, we're driving value through digital identity. We feel this is absolutely central to the digital economy."", ""And that's why we put it in the new network because there are people who have identity data and there are people who want to use identity data. We don't want to hold it. We're sitting somewhere in the middle, and we are essentially the trusted partner that can prove one way or another if a person is the person they claim to be. Minimal use of data, permission data."", ""That's [Inaudible]"", 'Cris Kennedy -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for taking the question.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.', 'Paul Golding -- Macquarie Group -- Analyst', ""Thanks so much. I guess to touch on Finicity since you just mentioned it, Michael. Do you see this evolving more so as a value-added service and solution driver or a volume driver now that you've had it in the portfolio for some time? And then as a follow-on, I just wanted to see if we could get some more color on the acceptance location growth from a regional perspective, given the strength in international volumes in the period. Thank you so much."", 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Right. So, starting with Finicity and then we have the corresponding set of capabilities through our IR acquisition in Europe. We're also building out connectivity in Australia. Those are the three regions where we're focused."", ""And open banking does a number of things. Essentially, what we see is a set of use cases here that, that rise to the top and everything that you could do with open banking. In the end, there's this big vision about open data, where people can use their data footprint. Small businesses can use the data footprint for getting access to better services."", ""But for now, what's really rising at the top is account opening, the example that I already gave. Open banking for payments, I come to that for a moment -- in a moment, open banking for lending and for small business in particular. So, those are kind of the three categories that we feel are particularly relevant right now for payments, it's really interesting. To your point, is this a volume driver? It could be."", ""Because the connectivity that we have here, what we're trying to do is facilitate payments, for example, in non-carded use cases as we have the pay by bank solution in the United States in partnership with JS Bank. So, we hope to see significant volume growth out of that. That's the whole idea. And that builds on our experience with pay by bank in the U.K."", ""This is a somewhat different approach here in the U.S., where our open banking capabilities are the true differentiators. So, use cases that matter. That's the focus. And out of that, we hope to see not only API clicks on account opening, but also payment volume coming through."", 'That was a second part of the question. My team is just reminding me. Acceptance growth regionally. I mean, it comes to the answer actually that Sachin gave earlier where we talked a little bit about payments growth and the regional comparison.', ""So, when you think beyond the United States, we see a tremendous growth opportunity. Here in the United States, you would say it's more new use cases and verticals, and it's more generally and broader acceptance across the payments landscape in the rest of the world. There's even significant geographic opportunities to grow. Take Japan, for example."", ""So, it's a country that is what the government has put out a stated policy to drive a cashless Japan. So, tremendous upside there. We talked about China earlier on, where we're investing heavily in acceptance footprint. So, I would say it's leaning a little more on the international side, but here in the U.S., we're very busy going for use cases and verticals."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore. Your line is open.', 'David Togut -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Thank you. Good morning. Europe continues to be a driver of differentiated growth for Mastercard. Could you share your insights into your runway for growth in some of your largest countries, for example, Germany and Italy? And maybe frame that in terms of payment volume growth and vast growth opportunity.', 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Right. Let me start off with that question. First of all, I do want to underline what you just said. It is a source of differentiated growth for us.', ""We've had a great run in Europe. And it's a combination of share growth, but it's also driven by the ways that we find to go after the accelerated secular shift that we saw on the back end of COVID. Countries like Germany really driving up contactless usage, just to give you one example. So, overall, Europe has been firing on all cylinders for us."", ""And I come back to the growth algorithm that we laid out for payments, which applies very much in Europe. So, European economies will do what they do, but we will continue to focus on share gain, but we will also be very busy to take the share gains that we've already had and turn that into profitable volume for us. Conversions driving that. We had a question on that earlier."", ""So, that's driver number one. And then going into new flows in Europe, there is opportunity there as well. If you look at alternative payment systems, everything that's going on in Europe, clearly, through PSD2 -- PSD3 and so forth, there's a lot of movement in Europe that we will stay on top as we look ahead into that. Differentiated assets in bill pay in the Nordics and so forth."", ""So, we have a pretty broad footprint to participate in all the drivers in Europe. In terms of services, the services has been strong in Europe for a long time. Our advisors on our consulting business has been a winner for us in Europe for the longest time. And if you look at some of these big wins, that we've talked about, they all have a significant contribution of services."", ""In fact, I would say, oftentimes, they are one of the reasons that we win those deals. So, nothing dramatically different there. I think Europe has caught up on secular trend in digitization, and we're firing on all cylinders. We have -- we're fully invested in Europe."", ""As you know, one of the big topics in Europe is European sovereignty, and we are deeply invested in Europe with our efforts, and we're engaging with -- in Brussels in the nation states and so forth, which is very important for us to do to be a partner on their journey."", 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. David, it's Sachin. I'll just emphasize what Michael just said, right? He has mentioned on a couple of occasions today that payments drives value-add service and solutions and value-added service and solutions drive payments. It's no different in Europe, right? For all the share wins we've had in Europe, for all the growth we're seeing on the payment side, it creates new opportunities for us on the services side."", ""And then vice versa, as you actually do deliver on those services, you get the benefit of additional data. When you get the benefit of additional data, you are able to help optimize existing portfolios, which again drives payment volume growth. And that's not unique to Europe. It's actually true for the way we run the business globally."", 'But the fact that we are actually increasingly becoming more prominent in the payment flow enables that cycle to work quite effectively.', 'David Togut -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.', 'Ken Suchoski -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', 'Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the yields on the domestic assessment revenue line. That yield has declined year over year for some time now, and they came in a little bit lighter than some were expecting this quarter.', ""I think you highlighted mix impacting the yields or the spread between revenue and volume growth. So, could you just provide some more detail around the specific changes that you're seeing in terms of mix? And could we get to a place where domestic yields are actually expanding year over year? Thank you."", 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Look, I mean, I'll comment on the yield piece, because what you're seeing effectively in the fourth quarter of 2023, when you look at payment network net revenue divided by GDV is what you see every year in terms of the sequential decline in yields. And that's primarily being driven by the fact that, remember, in the third quarter of all years, we tend to have our strongest cross-border performance. And our cross-border tends to come with our best yields. And so, what you've got is when you're getting more bang for the buck for $1 of GDV on the cross-border side than you are on the domestic volume side."", ""So, that's what's causing for that sequential decline. You'll see that as a pattern, which has existed in prior years as well. Broadly speaking, I would tell you that, otherwise, there's nothing unusual to call out on the payment network net revenue yield. The one reminder I'll give you is that we run the business not only to optimize payment network, net revenue yield, but overall net revenue yield for our company."", ""Because again, it goes back to the question David asked right before you, Ken, which is at the end of the day, we've got to be in the payment flow. We've got to allow ourselves to have the opportunity to deliver services on those payments to generate additional revenue, which causes for overall net accretion in our overall net revenue yield. So, I know your question is specific to payment network net revenue, but I just wanted to make sure you know that from our mindset standpoint, we're looking at payment network net revenue yield as well as overall net revenue growth to the company."", 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', ""And I should say, earlier when I was talking about the payment algorithm, I said that we are putting great focus on our financial discipline. And we do it with revenues in mind and with services revenue in mind. So, yes, it needs to add up to the overall net revenue yield as Sachin just said. But I'm telling you, we don't want to win every deal."", ""We want to win the deals we want to win, and we're pretty disciplined about it."", 'Ken Suchoski -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', 'Great.

I appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to dig in, Michael, if I'm at a little bit more on your pay by bank initiatives."", ""Can this be -- especially as we see the emergence of networks like tax in Brazil, for example. Can this be sort of a stand-alone growth driver in its own right? Or is it sort of folded into your overall comments on open banking? I just wanted to see if there's an important distinction to draw as we think about go-forward growth opportunities."", 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Right. So, I think both questions, your question and the previous question hit on an important point there. There is a particular point of interest for us at the intersection of open banking and payments. It enables -- the open banking connectivity enables us to go after use cases that we otherwise wouldn't be able to go after."", ""So, here's additional data that is available that you can then combine in combination with an underlying RTP rail to make a profitable proposition for a customer, which is exactly what Chase Pay-by-Bank is. Basically, you debit your customer when there's a balance, and that is what the open banking connectivity tells you. So, that's a good solution. If we look broadly around the world, Pix, UPI in India, FedNow, there's a bunch of real-time payment systems."", ""And those are the kind of rails where we have experience. We have connectivity. In some, we operate them ourselves. So, that is exactly what we're looking at as one of the assets and the propositions that we will bring together for our customers."", ""Now, more broadly speaking, when you look at Pix, when you look at UPI, one other thing to keep in mind is, here's public sector doing a good job in pulling in more participants in the overall digital economy so we can come in with our solutions, our real-time payment solutions, our card-based solutions. But they're basically extending the digital economy to create a tide that kind of lifts everybody's boats, financial inclusion being the headline. So, that's something to consider. Somewhere in between, there are points that we will manage very carefully as in when these systems grow and they provide alternatives to our solutions that we compete and provide the best solution to consumers and to our customers."", ""On the fraud side, on ease of use, a lot of these systems don't have all of these functionalities. So, those are things that we focus on. So, we're focused on providing the best choice to our customers.

Sachin, I was just hoping you could put a finer point on the growth algorithm within the full-year revenue outlook. I know you mentioned some of the cadence dynamics with VAS and currency vault, but any help on what you're assuming for volume and transaction growth relative to the January trends, rebates and incentives, pricing? Any help on those would be great. Thanks."", 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, look, I'm not going to give you a specific kind of forecast as it relates to what we're assuming from a driver standpoint. We've kind of shared with you what our base case is. And the base case continues to assume that the consumer spending remains healthy, and we're reflecting in the current spending dynamics from an overall kind of volumes and transaction standpoint."", ""I think to your question on pricing, it's no different than it's been in the past. We always price based on the value we deliver to our customers. And we will continue to do that wherever it makes sense across the globe. And we kind of have new things which we're launching, there's new value we're delivering to our customers."", ""And as we do that, we'll continue to price for that. On specifically the Contra question. I think -- the important thing to note on Contra is that, at the end of the day, Contra is enabling volume growth, right? We pay incentives and rebates to our customers to bring more volume onto our network. And as we do that, we're paying for that."", ""For the first quarter, we expect our Contra as a percentage of our payment network assessments to be roughly similar to what you saw in Q4 of 2023. I would tell you, on a full-year basis, it's going to be entirely a function of how we see deals play out, what the pipeline is. Obviously, we know what the outlook is from a pipeline standpoint. Some of that will come to fruition."", ""Some of that will not. There'll be other things which will move in and out. And so I'm not going to kind of share with you what the full-year outlook is on Contra. But for Q1, I can kind of give you my thoughts, which are, we expect that Contra as a percentage of payment network assessments will be roughly similar to what we saw in Q4 of 2023."", 'Trevor Williams -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks.', 'Devin Corr -- Head of Investor Relations', 'Maybe we have time for just one more, Briana.', 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.', 'Ashwin Shirvaikar -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Thanks. Hi, Michael, Sachin, good quarter. I appreciate all the comments so far. My question is on real-time payments.', ""And, Michael, you did have some incremental comments there on TCH but saw the TCH renewal. Obviously, you have a global set of capabilities here. My question is, what's the runway, and what drives it? Is it the use cases rather than more countries? And then if it is use cases, what are some of the use cases that you see coming up that are exciting from a conversions perspective?"", 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Right. So, first of all, the strategic relationship here in the U.S. with the Clearinghouse is important to note. Back when in 2016, '17, real-time payments really took off."", 'This is when we invested in VocaLink. And VocaLink was a partner with the Clearinghouse at the time. So, a strong and more strategic renewal here is a big statement, and it speaks to our position in real-time payments. Ten out of the top 50 GDP countries, we either operate or are providing software and services to the real-time payment system.', ""So, it's real. It's there as the name indicates, and it's carrying a lot of volume for us in itself. That's an interesting business. But it's much more than that."", ""It's much more than that as we're talking to various players, including ones that I mentioned about new applications that come on top of that. Coming right back to the Chase Pay-by-Bank example, here is access to rails on one hand and then a set of additional data that turns a simple payment that gets money from A to B to something that's a value-add payment. That is where we're going to go. And these use cases will play out in a somewhat different way."", ""It is obviously always our interest to find global solutions, but it's also -- this is a rather more geographic specifically driven space. So, we'll have to see where that all lands. So, we keep that in mind, which is why we're not driving into many more markets right now. We're the most critical markets."", ""And here we're staying very close to where that is going. But it's applications and it's scaling volumes in the markets that we're in. It's where the focus is."", 'Ashwin Shirvaikar -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Devin Corr -- Head of Investor Relations', 'Thank you very much. Thank you, Michael. Any last comments?', 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, as always, thank you for your support to Mastercard. Thank you for listening to Sachin and me, and thank you to everybody at Mastercard for making all this work. We'll speak to you in one quarter. It's also unusual to note this is on a Wednesday today."", ""I don't think we ever had that before. Certainly, for me, this is the first Wednesday. We'll see how we mix it up next time. Speak to you in a quarter."", 'Thank you, and bye-bye.', 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, everyone.', 'Operator', '[Operator signoff]', 'Duration: 0 minutes', 'Devin Corr -- Head of Investor Relations', 'Michael Miebach -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sachin Mehra -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Harshita Rawat -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Craig Maurer -- Financial Technology Partners -- Analyst', 'Sanjay Sakhrani -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Dan Perlin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Darrin Peller -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'Cris Kennedy -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', 'Paul Golding -- Macquarie Group -- Analyst', 'David Togut -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Ken Suchoski -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', 'Andrew Jeffrey -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'Trevor Williams -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Ashwin Shirvaikar -- Citi -- Analyst', 'More MA analysis', 'All earnings call transcripts', ""This article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.

""While inflation is moderating, there are isolated cases in which goods and services remain elevated.""', 'For the quarter that ended December 31, Mastercard reported net revenue of $6.5 billion, up 11% from about $5.85 billion a year earlier. It reported a profit of $3.18 per share, up 18% from about $2.70 a year earlier. That beat the average estimate of $3.08 peer share from Zacks Investment Research.', '""We delivered strong earnings and revenue growth for the full year 2023, driven by healthy consumer spending, cross-border volume growth of 24%, and the solid execution of our strategy,"" Miebach said.', ""But the pace of payments growth is slowing in the U.S. Switched volume, which refers to authorization, clearing and settlement, grew 11% during the fourth quarter. That's down from 14% in the third quarter and higher than 10% during January 2024."", ""Similar to Visa, which attributed slower January sales partly to the weather in the U.S., Mastercard said the slower January numbers stemmed from a series of severe winter storms. Payment performance outside during periods of calmer weather were in line with December's performance. An analyst note from Jeffries also said the January dip for Mastercard was likely due to inclement weather."", 'Visa last week reported a decline of about 80 basis in U.S. payment volume growth, as well as a decline in payments in January, an exception to what were overall strong earnings. Visa attributed the declines to inherently temporary factors such as a less favorable mix of weekends and weekdays for shopping, in addition to the poor weather in January. American Express reported strong earnings, but noted flat payment volume from small businesses and an increase in loss provisions. Amex said macroeconomic stress has not substantially impacted its business, and affirmed its growth outlook for 2024.', ""Discover's earnings saw a charge-off rate of 4.1% at the end of the fourth quarter, up from 2.1% over 2022 and 59 basis points from the prior quarter. Discover also raised its loan-loss provision from $900 million to $1.9 billion."", 'While U.S. electronic payments growth continues to outpace GDP and population growth, domestic electronic-payments growth will gradually slow, even with a range of new use cases being developed, according to Eric Grover, a principal at Intrepid Ventures. ""Global electronic payments growth should remain robust for decades to come, barring major war or economic calamity,"" Grover said.', 'Mastercard also said tougher comparisons weighed on payment growth statistics. The spikes in payment growth were higher late in 2022 and early 2023, making it harder for current growth rates to match the recent past. Mastercard is still pursuing ""secular"" opportunities in the U.S., including expanding open-loop transit payments, open banking and real-time payment processing, according to Miebach. ""There are also geopolitical concerns in several markets,"" Miebach said of factors that could impact payment growth in the year ahead.', 'Mastercard is monitoring the potential impact of the dozens of 2024 elections that may be contested or otherwise volatile, both in the U.S. and globally. Analysts asked Miebach about the impact of isolationism, or leaders that are less prone to support international business. Mastercard, for example, reported 18% growth in cross-border payment volume during the quarter.', 'Miebach did not directly address the impact of isolationism on international payments, but noted that the card network is monitoring elections and is doing scenario planning based on different results or unexpected news surrounding elections.', '""Elections are no different from monitoring fiscal moves by central banks,"" Miebach said, adding that Mastercard is performing scenario planning and will form a response strategy in the event an election causes an unforeseen interruption in payments or an economic impact.', '""The past three years have had no shortage of such challenges and we responded quickly,"" Miebach said.', ""Mastercard additionally plans to support payments in China in the near future, Miebach said. Mastercard has been trying to establish a domestic payment market in China for years, but has faced quickly changing regulations from the Chinese government. China appears to be more open than in the past; China's regulators have approved Mastercard's local joint venture to process payments."", '""We\'re thrilled about China. It\'s a massive opportunity,"" Miebach said, adding that use cases will include payments for Chinese consumers both inside China and when traveling.', 'For the full 2023 year, Mastercard reported net revenue of $25.1 billion, up 13% from about $22.2 billion the prior year. Mastercard projected growth in the low double digits for the first quarter. For the full year of 2024, Mastercard projected growth at the high end of low double digit rate.', '""The full-year outlook … is in line with Wall Street projections, implying 17% earnings per share growth,"" Jeffries analysts said.']"

In fiscal Q1, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $9.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75 above the high end of our guidance. Revenues from our chipset business of $8.4 billion reflect healthy Android demand and continued strong momentum in automotive. Licensing business revenues were $1.5 billion. We're pleased with these results, and I will now share some key highlights from the business. In handsets, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform is setting a new standard for on-device gen AI experiences for premium smartphones and powers all through flagship Android devices launched and launching this fiscal year. Notably, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform for Galaxy is featured in the recently announced Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra globally, in addition to the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus in multiple regions. The Galaxy S24 series includes on-device AI features such as live translate interpreter, chat assist, nitography and more. This marks the beginning of how gen AI will evolve the overall smartphone experience and highlights the significant opportunity for Snapdragon platforms. We're also announcing that we extended a multiyear agreement with Samsung relating to Snapdragon platforms for flagship Galaxy smartphone launches starting in 2024. The extended agreement demonstrates the value of Snapdragon 8, our technology leadership and our successful long-term strategic partnership with Samsung. In the quarter, we also announced the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 mobile platform, which brings leading gen AI capabilities to high-tier Android smartphones and is a category leader in both experiences and performance. In our QTL business, we're pleased to share that we recently extended several key license agreements. First, Apple exercised its unilateral option to extend its global patent license agreement for an additional 2 years, taking the existing agreement through to March 2027; second, we have renewed long-term agreements with 2 significant Chinese smartphone OEMs. In addition, we continue to negotiate new agreements or renewals with other key licensees and OEMs, including some whose current agreements are set to expire in early fiscal 2025. Automotive continues to be an important pillar of our growth and diversification strategy. Notably, 75 new models launched commercially in 2023 were for technologies, highlighting Qualcomm's growing scale in automotive and execution of our design wins. Earlier this month at CES, we announced our collaboration with Bosch to have our Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC power their new central vehicle computer. As a reminder, Snapdragon Ride Flex enables the fusion of infotainment in ADAS functionalities on a single SoC, enabling automakers to realize a unified central compute and software-defined vehicle architecture that scales across tiers. Additionally, we demonstrated digital cockpits connected services and advanced driver assistance enabled by gen AI models running locally on the Snapdragon platform. This new capabilities can be enabled on a number of existing designs via a software upgrade. This represents significant new opportunities for Qualcomm and our partners. In PCs, we're driving towards the launch of Snapdragon X Elite in mid-2024 and are pleased that our design win traction continues to increase since the platform was announced last October. We expect Snapdragon X Elite to set the industry benchmark for on-device gen AI and copilot experiences in addition to leading performance and battery life for next-generation Windows PCs. We recently expanded our mixed reality solutions with the announcement of the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2. Our new platform supports 4.3K per eye resolution and 90 frames per second in 12 or more concurrent cameras to deliver crisp, immersive, mixed reality and virtual reality experiences. We are proud to partner with Samsung and Google to provide leading XR experiences to Galaxy users by utilizing Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2. In edge networking, we announced the Snapdragon X35 5G modern RF system, the world's first commercial Release 17 5G Red Cap solution. The Snapdragon X35 brings a new class of purpose-built 5G for Internet of Things devices. Devices powered by Snapdragon X35 are expected to launch by the first half of 2024. We continue to believe that industrial edge devices with connectivity, high-performance computing and on-device AI will become one of our largest addressable opportunities fueled by the secular trends of digital transformation. As such, we're accelerating our investments in solutions, ecosystem and broad channel enablement to position ourselves for growth while we navigate the industry-wide inventory draw down. One key area of focus is to enable our customers to unlock the potential of gen AI at the enterprise using our chipset solutions. As an example, Zebra Technologies and Toshiba recently demonstrated on-device gen AI capabilities for enterprise workflows and inventory management at retail self-checkout, respectively. Additionally, Honeywell showcased a qualcomm-powered Edge AI box for warehouse applications. As we complete the first quarter of fiscal '24 ahead of our expectations, I'm very optimistic about Qualcomm's trajectory and the opportunities ahead. The fundamentals of our growth drivers remain unchanged, our diversification strategy is working, and we're making significant progress across mobile, automotive, computing, XR, edge networking, industrial IoT and more. At the upcoming Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we will provide an update on our [seller] modem and connectivity leadership as well as on our overall scale of Snapdragon gen AI. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."", 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our first fiscal quarter earnings. We are pleased to announce strong non-GAAP results above the high end of guidance with revenues of $9.9 billion and EPS of $2.75. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 74% were at the high end of guidance, deflecting slightly higher handset units. QCT delivered revenues of $8.4 billion and EBT margin of 31%, both above the high end of guidance, reflecting strength in handsets and automotive revenues. QCT EBT margin includes the benefit of revenue scale, stronger product mix and operating discipline. Handset revenues of $6.7 billion were higher than our prior expectations primarily due to the increased demand driven by the acceleration of Android flagship launches with our Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform. Notably, our Android handset revenues from Chinese OEMs exceeded our expectations of greater than 35% sequential growth. IoT revenues of $1.1 billion reflect the industry-wide challenges we've previously outlined. We achieved record automotive revenues of $598 million which grew by 12% sequentially, reflecting the increased content in new vehicle launches with our Snapdragon digital chassis platform. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% sequentially to $2.1 billion and included the benefit of accelerated implementation of cost actions that we had previously outlined for the first half of fiscal '24. Lastly, we returned $1.7 billion to stockholders during the quarter, including $784 million in stock repurchases and $895 million in dividends. Before turning to second fiscal quarter guidance, I'll update you on global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units. We estimate that global units declined by mid-single-digit percentage in calendar '23 relative to calendar '22, an improvement from our prior expectations due to the recent stabilization in demand. For calendar '24, we estimate that global handset units will be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. This estimate includes expected growth of high single digit to low double-digit percentage in 5G handsets.Turning to guidance for the second fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $8.9 billion to $9.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.20 to $2.40. The sequential decline in revenues and non-GAAP EPS relative to the first fiscal quarter will be driven by seasonality for a modem only handset customer in both QTL and QCT. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7.6 billion to $8.2 billion and EBT margins of 27% to 29%. For QCT handset revenues coming off strong performance in the first fiscal quarter, we anticipate Android revenues will be approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. On a sequential basis, we expect QCT IoT revenues to grow by mid- to high single-digit percentage with QCT automotive revenues slightly down, consistent with the trend in the prior year. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $2.2 billion. This reflects typical calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs. In closing, very pleased to start our fiscal year with strong execution and financial performance. In QTL, as Cristiano outlined, we are pleased to have extended several key license agreements. We do not expect any material change in QTL licensing revenue run rate as a result of these extensions. In QCT, our technology differentiation will accelerate with our on-device gen AI leadership and introduction of our custom Qualcomm Oryon CPU. We also remain well positioned to execute on our diversification strategy by extending our technology portfolio to deliver industry-leading products across automotive and IoT. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio."", 'Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan', 'Thank you, Akash. Operator, we are now ready for questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.', 'Samik Chatterjee', ""Congrats on the results here. Maybe if I can start with AI and particularly the launch of the Samsung S24. Now you have some incremental sort of experience in terms of devices launching in the market and the performance and consumer reception you're seeing to that. So I know you outlined adoption of 3G, 4G, but any way of giving us some flavor of what you're thinking in terms of adoption of these AI devices or AI on edge in terms of the smartphone market? How similar or different will that curve look like relative to 5G adoption? And any insights from the sort of pipeline you're working on will be helpful for us. And I have a follow-up."", 'Cristiano Renno Amon', ""Thanks for the question. This is Cristiano. Look, it's early, but I think it's -- we're definitely excited about what we see in the beginning. It's not only unique to the Galaxy S24 that has a number of now use cases running gen AI on the device. I mentioned a few of in my prepared remarks, like translation. And you have a much more effective assistance in a number of different applications. We're going to see productivity coming. But we'll also see that happening with some of our other customers from China launching a number of models. So I think we have a large number now of models being ported into our hardware for gen AI. I think we're starting to see the beginning of new use cases. Reviews have been positive, and we are happy with we've seen the results following the launch. I think we need to monitor the situation. But eventually, at a minimum, is going to have a favorable impact on mix, which is a trend that we continue to see premium and high tier with more computing power. It is the fastest-growing segment in the handset market."", 'Samik Chatterjee', ""Yes. Okay. Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, the -- and the Android OBX customers or the Chinese OEMs you work with, they exceeded your expectation in the fiscal first quarter. But as you're looking to the second quarter, you're guiding to a more flattish trajectory here. I know the industry has sort of been looking at inventory refill from those customers as well, driving some of the momentum. So just wondering if you can give us an update in terms of what you're seeing from those customers. And if at all, Huawei and their reemerges in the market is starting to have an impact in terms of volume or market share for these customers as well in the context of your flat guide for them for quarter-over-quarter."", 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Sure. Samik, it's Akash. As we have said previously, as we entered fiscal '24, our view was that Android channel inventory had largely normalized. And so as we go through the year, we typically see normal bill bleed cycle around handset launches. So that's kind of the phase we are in from our perspective. In the first quarter, what we saw was higher demand due to the acceleration of Android flagship launches with our new chip, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. And we saw very strong demand across all the major Android OEMs. And so happy, of course, with that traction and that momentum carries over to the second quarter as well. And that's what you're seeing both in our results and our going forward. In terms of your comment on Huawei, really what we've seen since Huawei 5G launch is that the premium tier TAM in China has expanded. And so we're continuing to see strong demand from our customers post that launch."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.', 'Matthew D. Ramsay', ""I guess for my first question, Cristiano, it was good to hear, I guess, the formal announcement of an extension with your partnership with Samsung. And you mentioned, I think, in your prepared script that it started with 2024 devices, but I assume it's longer than that. So maybe you could give us a little context as to the links and any details you can share on the new agreement. You guys obviously have your new custom CPUs coming into the Snapdragon road map and some expanded MPU product as well. So we see kind of what the split is of share in the flagship at Samsung currently, but I'm just trying to understand a bit more about what this means for on a go-forward basis."", 'Cristiano Renno Amon', ""Thanks for the question, Matt. The agreement that we announced at this earnings call, it is a multiyear agreement. We're not disclosing the duration, but there are several years into that agreement. And I think your observation is correct. I think it starts in 2024. I think as you look at the launch of Galaxy S24 is a good proxy on how we should think about the agreement between us and Samsung. But most important is the thing that you outlined. Our road map is getting stronger over time, especially with our custom CPU coming to mobile, and we're aiming to have the leadership position in the mobile performance on CPU. And our NPU continue to expand as we -- as I mentioned before, we're just at the beginning of the gen AI transition. I think in summary, we're very pleased with our relationship with Samsung, and it's a very long-term relationship with this customer."", 'Matthew D. Ramsay', ""Got it. I guess my follow-up question is one for Akash. First of all, Akash, congratulations on the new COO hat. Well done. But my question is around margins. And I noticed that even with the IoT business down dramatically, there was some improvement in sequential gross margin in the quarter and back above 30% in QCT operating margins. So maybe you could discuss some of the moving parts with margins in the business because it was a -- I'm -- pleasantly a bit better than I had modeled, and I kind of want to see what might be sustainable or what actions you took on a go-forward basis on both the gross and the operating side."", 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Thank you, Matt, and thanks for the well wishes. I'm looking forward in this new role to working with Cristiano and the executive team to kind of deliver on our long-term priorities. And of course, I'll continue to remain committed to my CFO role, working closely with the team here and maintaining consistency and transparency and looking forward to seeing a lot of you at upcoming events. On the margin side, what you saw in the first quarter is really the fact that our gross margins were stronger because the mix was richer. We had a higher set of premium tier launches coming through and that impacted our volume, and we benefited from that mix -- richer mix. And if you look at our second quarter guide, we are guiding largely in line with how our first quarter came in. So that was obviously great to see. From an operating margin perspective, it's -- in addition to the strength in the gross margins, obviously, the revenue scale and the actions we took on the OpEx also benefited. And so we were happy to -- extremely happy to deliver 31% operating margin in QCT and really focused on delivering to the long-term target we've outlined to the investors."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.', 'Thomas Michael Walkley', 'Congrats on extending some of the licensing deals. I guess, just want to jump a little bit into the IoT business, the 3 segments. I assume, consumer is still weaker. But can you update us kind of how the inventory bleed is trending for the 3 business within IoT? And then within that question, too, just on the recovery of IoT, can you share with us the X Elite ramp and how material this might become for IoT, say, in the next 1 to 2 years?', 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Maybe I'll address the first part and then Cristiano can talk through the X Elite question. From an IoT inventory perspective, what we have seen is stabilization really on the consumer side. As you know, we were one of the first to call out the weakness in IoT, and now we're seeing it go through both on the industrial and the edge networking side. And consistent with our previous comments, we think the first quarter was the bottom for our IoT revenue stream. We're guiding second quarter up mid- to high single digits. Second half of the year -- fiscal year, as we see the inventory channel kind of normalizing and end markets kind of benefiting from that, we're excited about what our product portfolio can bring. And overall, lots of opportunities for us there. So over -- in my mind, there's significant uncertainty, but we are cautiously optimistic, and I think we have a great product portfolio as we look forward."", 'Cristiano Renno Amon', ""Look, your question about X Elite in PC. It's too early. We're tracking to the launch of products with this chipset tied with the next version of Microsoft Windows that has a lot of the Windows AI capabilities. We're still maintaining the same date, which is driven by Windows, which is mid-2024, getting ready for back-to-school. What we're excited about it is since we announced that at Tech Summit showing the performance of the product and the AI capabilities, design traction continue to increase. So we had increased the number of designs since last quarter. and we continue to march forward towards the launch. We like that everybody is now talking about on-device AI on PC. That's where we started this journey with X Elite. And I think that proved to be a tailwind to the opportunity for us in PCs."", 'Thomas Michael Walkley', ""Great. And maybe, Cristiano, just a quick follow-on question. Just on the auto business, how should we think about the ramp of that business over the next 1 to 2 years? You've talked about a lot of design win activity and digital chassis ramping this year. But with ADAS coming into the model, how might that business ramp towards your target in 2026?"", 'Cristiano Renno Amon', ""No, absolutely. Thank you for your question. Look, let me step back a little bit and say we're extremely pleased with our performance in auto, especially when you look at the overall market. Right now, you look at Qualcomm results with record revenues and very strong, I think, year-over-year growth. In 2023, in this year that just closed, we launched 75 models with our silicon with a significant improvement in silicon content as it relates to those immersive cockpit and in many cases, processing for safety. So we're very happy with the business. And I think the answer to your question is we are on track to meet our targets that we set on the Auto Investor Day of $4 billion and $9 billion, respectively, I think for '26 at the end of the decade. So we're on track for that. And the next quarter, we're going to give you an update on the design win pipeline that continues to grow."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.', 'Stacy Aaron Rasgon', ""So given that you've got Android, Android was pretty strong in December, and it's flat into March. How are you thinking about June seasonality given all these trends and moving pieces? I know it's usually down a bit for March, but I guess in the current environment, how are you thinking about June seasonality?"", 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Stacy, it's Akash. No change to the shape of the year comments that we made last time. Following second quarter, we do expect third quarter to be the lowest quarter. It's one of the quarters where we do not have any significant flagship launches. And as a result, you kind of see a decline in third quarter then growth back into the fourth quarter. And it's -- when you look at second to third quarter, we expect a trend consistent with the last 2 years. First half, obviously benefited from this acceleration of launches for Android and pretty happy with that. And I think it sets us up as we look forward in terms of both content growth with our strong road map and just positioning overall in the handset market."", 'Stacy Aaron Rasgon', 'Got it. And so my follow-up. I just want to ask about Huawei. Was Huawei still completely out of the model in December? And is it out of the model in the March guide?', 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Yes. So as we've said in the past, Stacy, we do have a 4G license to ship to Huawei. And so we've continued to ship based on customer demand. But as you're aware, they have launched a 5G device with their own chip, and that's, I think, their priority going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.', 'Christopher Caso', ""I guess just a question on QTL, and coming from your comments about the global handset market, it sounds like you're a little more optimistic on the 5G market on the year. QTL revenue has been kind of stuck in this range because of where handset units have been. Do you -- is -- I guess what's the outlook for QTL going forward in the context of what you're expecting for the handset market overall?"", 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Yes. So as we outlined for our handset market, when you look at calendar '24, overall market, we expect it to be flat to slightly up. But within that, 5G, obviously, is our target market, especially for the chip business. We expect that to be high single digit to low double digit up on a year-over-year basis. Within QTL, I will stick with the guidance we have given before. We think there's a scale to the business that's aligned with the handset market and the 2 will move in line. And then on the extensions of the license, I just wanted to make sure that I said this in my prepared remarks, but just to confirm. As a result of the extension, we do not expect any material change in our QCT licensing revenue run rate. So it's consistent with the program. In the QTL licensing revenue run rate, it's consistent with the program."", 'Christopher Caso', ""Great. That's helpful. As a follow-up. Cristiano, I wonder if you could speak to sort of the decision to reengage in custom cores with Oryon. And what outcome you expect to that? I mean, it sounds like that's been one of the reasons or one of the things behind the renewal of the Samsung agreement. What sort of change in the market, because Qualcomm did custom cores in the past? And what do you expect to get out of that in terms of market share and content and such?"", 'Cristiano Renno Amon', ""Thank you, Chris, for your question. Look, it's consistent, I think, with the strategy we outlined, I think, following the acquisition of NUVIA. In the past, Qualcomm has been designing now its own custom cores. And I think the first instantiation of that was for PCs. Actually, if you remember, in the past, that was the key motivation as we embark on this journey to create a leading SoC for laptops for the Windows ecosystem. We needed to have the performance leadership and we needed to design our own CPU to deliver the results that we did with X Elite. Now we're taking that across the entire road map. Your observation is correct. As we take that into mobile next, we're seeing significant interest from our partners as it truly becomes a leadership position in the marketplace now across all cores, not only graphics and AI but also CPU. And we're not stopping there. Following smartphone, it's going to go into our automotive business, and we're excited about what the team has accomplished to date. Oryon is really well positioned to be the leading CPU core in the industry."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.', 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""Can you talk about restocking in China? It looks like the China Android, obviously, was up a ton and it's being guided flat. Your peer was a bit cautious on this. Can you talk -- do you think you're shipping that to consumption? And do you think you're going to ship to consumption through the rest of the year? And then I had another question."", 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Yes. Tim, consistent with what I said earlier in the call. I think we were kind of at -- largely at normalized inventory for Android entering the fiscal year. What you saw in the December quarter, at least for us, to a large extent, was a build for the various premium tier launches that happened during the period. And so we do expect normal bill bleed cycles through the year as devices launch. But that's kind of the framework with which we are operating going forward."", 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', 'Got it. And then now that you have the modem for longer for this one flagship customer, one can envision a scenario where maybe you can leverage that into some new RF content that you have not had in the past. Is this a scenario? I mean, it seems like it could add $1 billion maybe. I mean you were sort of running to $4 billion a year in your RFFE business prior to stopping to tell us what that is. So it seems like that is something you could potentially leverage the reliance on your modem business.', 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Yes. Tim, I'd say that's a conversation, obviously, that we will talk to the customer about. It's a part of our portfolio, and we'll make it available if they're interested."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.', 'Ross Clark Seymore', 'A couple of questions and, Akash, congrats on the COO role. The first one is on the OpEx side of things. You guys did a great job in the calendar fourth quarter and you gave the guidance for the fiscal first -- or fiscal second quarter. How should we think about that for the remainder of the year, given your commentary on kind of doubling down on some of the opportunistic investments to diversify the company, new cores, et cetera?', 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Yes, Ross, thank you very much. From an OpEx perspective, really, the way we think about it is any hiring that we do we'll be very selective and focused on really acquiring new skills that are required for diversification. But other than that, we've gone through a reduction recently. We think we're at scale to a large extent, and we're committed to operating discipline."", 'Ross Clark Seymore', ""Great. And I guess for my follow-up. I noticed in the 10-Q, you had a new 10% customer, I think it was a 14% customer. I don't expect you to name who that is. But is that a reflection of the strong China demand that you talked about in the continuation of good future growth opportunities? Or was there any onetime aspect of that customer, whoever it may be, popping up in the quarter?"", 'Akash Palkhiwala', 'I think the way you framed it in your first theory is a reasonable way of thinking about it.', 'Operator', ""Our next question is coming from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""Just passing on my congratulations to Akash as well. I just wanted to ask on the ASP side for Android. You're obviously kind of characterizing a market that's flattish into March, kind of the bottom in June and then improving from there. But you benefited from some good mix in the beginning of the fiscal year here. Could you talk about what you would expect from a mix perspective as you go to the back half? Would you see the same kind of strength on the ASP side that you've kind of seen over the past year? That would be really helpful to understand."", 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Yes. So if you think about premium flagship launches for our OEMs, a lot of the launches happen in the holiday time frame just before the holidays, going into Chinese New Year as well. And so you've seen a lot of those happen. We do have some significant launches through the middle of the year, but obviously, the next big launch goes into the holiday season, starting with Apple and then going into the Android launches. So that's the typical cadence. Now when -- just to confirm, that's just the premium tier we are talking about. Of course, there are other tiers and including the high tier, where we have very significant presence and that does drive a significant portion of our -- the launches that happened through the year and also our revenue base."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""Helpful. And then just on the auto business. You've clearly seen some weaker data points just out of the ecosystem. Can you explain why your auto business may not be levered to some of like the ADAS areas where you've seen a particular weakness of late? And like when do those ADAS and wins start layering on? Is that more of like a '25 story for you guys or '26? Just can you talk about the pipeline and when you see those more advanced wins kind of layering into the revenue stream?"", 'Cristiano Renno Amon', ""This is Cristiano. Look, the automotive story of Qualcomm is primarily driven by share gains as models with our silicon, part of our pipeline started to materialize into revenue. And the way you should think about it, historically, a lot of the revenue was telematics. Now you see the largest component being a lot of the fully immersive digital cockpits on the car. And we already have some revenue from ADAS processing. You see a lot of cars, for example, in China with both ADAS and autonomy with our processor. You see some of our customers in the United States with our processor. And I think that continues to grow. As we get towards our 2026 revenue target, you're probably going to see very healthy components of all of those elements."", 'Operator', 'Our final question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.', 'Tal Liani', ""I have 2 follow-ups on answers or questions you had before. The first one is Samsung. On one hand, there is a new contract. On the other hand, Samsung is going to use their own more in '24 versus '23. So net-net, are you expecting revenues of Samsung to go up or down in '24 versus '23? What are your expectations of share losses within -- can you frame it for us? And the second question is on the auto business. You had a phenomenal quarter. It's very different from the other auto companies. Most other auto Companies had weakness. What is the strength related to? Meaning is it share gain with certain customers? Is it new product? Or can you just put some color on the strength, the relative strength, versus the others?"", 'Akash Palkhiwala', ""Yes, Tal, it's Akash. So on this -- on Samsung and this is a conversation about the premium tier, I assume. In G S23, we did have global share. In the G S24 that just launched and consistent with what we said on the last quarter, we expect to have a majority share based on the model split between us and Exynos. As Cristiano indicated in his prepared remarks, one of the benefits of the agreement that we did with them is it gives us predictability on our position within the premium tier going forward. And then from a content perspective, there's clearly content expansion happening. And this is really when you look at our premium tier road map, not just with gen AI coming in, our custom CPU cores coming in as well, but then also across other technologies. As consumers demand more capability, we see our content and our ASP both continue to grow. Switching over to your second question on automotive. You should really think -- the way to think about our automotive business is we're tied to the launch of new cars. Clearly, the industry is going through a transformation, digitization of cars, and we are right at the intersection of that transformation. We are benefiting as cars put in more infotainment content for experience within the car. More ADAS content comes into the car as well. And really, we get to benefit from all those intersection points in the car, and we're increasing the content as new cars launch. So that's the maybe a disconnect between some of our peers, what they're seeing and what we're seeing. Stepping back, I mean, clearly, this is an industry that's going through some shorter-term dynamics, so we'll be closely monitoring it. But when you step back, our technology, our position, our products look really good, and we're excited about where we're going."", 'Operator', ""That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?"", 'Cristiano Renno Amon', ""Yes. Just in closing, I'd just like to remind everyone, look, we're -- as I said, we're happy with the quarter. We see the android market stabilizing after we've been to '23. That was a year of correction. We like the transition of user experience with gen AI. That could create an opportunity in mobile. This is one of those times for Qualcomm. They are both our Apple and Samsung revenue on the chip side or under contract. We're very happy about that. We continue to move towards stability of the QTL revenue stream with those new agreements. As you look at the growth opportunity, I think the auto results speak for itself. We're now in the IoT segment, really focus on the launch of X Elite. In the PC, we announced a new product for XR. And if you believe that, that market is finally going to get very large scale, we're well positioned with our partnership with Meta as well as Samsung and Google. And as IoT, especially industrial goes to the correction, we expect that to resume growth. So we're focused on what we can control, busy at work with the growth and diversification of the company. And I want to say a big thank you for all of our partners and employees that helped us get to this quarter. Thank you very much, and I'll talk to you all next quarter."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.""]"

And now to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon."", 'Cristiano Amon -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q1, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $9.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75 above the high end of our guidance. Revenues from our chipset business of $8.4 billion reflect healthy Android demand and continued strong momentum in automotive.', ""Licensing business revenues were $1.5 billion. We're pleased with these results, and I will now share some key highlights from the business. In handsets, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform is setting a new standard for on-device gen AI experiences for premium smartphones and powers all through flagship Android devices launched and launching this fiscal year. Notably, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform for Galaxy is featured in the recently announced Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra globally, in addition to the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus in multiple regions."", ""The Galaxy S24 series includes on-device AI features such as live translate interpreter, chat assist, nitography, and more. This marks the beginning of how gen AI will evolve the overall smartphone experience and highlights the significant opportunity for Snapdragon platforms. We're also announcing that we extended a multiyear agreement with Samsung relating to Snapdragon platforms for flagship Galaxy smartphone launches starting in 2024. The extended agreement demonstrates the value of Snapdragon 8, our technology leadership, and our successful long-term strategic partnership with Samsung."", ""In the quarter, we also announced the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 mobile platform, which brings leading gen AI capabilities to high-tier Android smartphones and is a category leader in both experiences and performance. In our QTL business, we're pleased to share that we recently extended several key license agreements. First, Apple exercised its unilateral option to extend its global patent license agreement for an additional two years, taking the existing agreement through to March 2027; second, we have renewed long-term agreements with two significant Chinese smartphone OEMs. In addition, we continue to negotiate new agreements or renewals with other key licensees and OEMs, including some whose current agreements are set to expire in early fiscal 2025."", ""Automotive continues to be an important pillar of our growth and diversification strategy. Notably, 75 new models launched commercially in 2023 were for technologies, highlighting Qualcomm's growing scale in automotive and execution of our design wins. Earlier this month at CES, we announced our collaboration with Bosch to have our Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC power their new central vehicle computer. As a reminder, Snapdragon Ride Flex enables the fusion of infotainment in ADAS functionalities on a single SoC, enabling automakers to realize a unified central compute and software-defined vehicle architecture that scales across tiers."", ""Additionally, we demonstrated digital cockpits connected services and advanced driver assistance enabled by gen AI models running locally on the Snapdragon platform. These new capabilities can be enabled on a number of existing designs via a software upgrade. This represents significant new opportunities for Qualcomm and our partners. In PCs, we're driving toward the launch of Snapdragon X Elite in mid-2024 and are pleased that our design win traction continues to increase since the platform was announced last October."", 'We expect Snapdragon X Elite to set the industry benchmark for on-device gen AI and copilot experiences in addition to leading performance and battery life for next-generation Windows PCs. We recently expanded our mixed reality solutions with the announcement of the Snapdragon XR2-plus Gen 2. Our new platform supports 4.3K per eye resolution and 90 frames per second in 12 or more concurrent cameras to deliver crisp, immersive, mixed reality and virtual reality experiences. We are proud to partner with Samsung and Google to provide leading XR experiences to Galaxy users by utilizing Snapdragon XR2-plus Gen 2.', ""In edge networking, we announced the Snapdragon X35 5G Modem-RF system, the world's first commercial Release 17 5G Red Cap solution. The Snapdragon X35 brings a new class of purpose-built 5G for Internet of Things devices. Devices powered by Snapdragon X35 are expected to launch by the first half of 2024. We continue to believe that industrial edge devices with connectivity, high-performance computing, and on-device AI will become one of our largest addressable opportunities fueled by the secular trends of digital transformation."", ""As such, we're accelerating our investments in solutions, ecosystem, and broad channel enablement to position ourselves for growth while we navigate the industrywide inventory drawdown. One key area of focus is to enable our customers to unlock the potential of gen AI at the enterprise using our chipset solutions. As an example, Zebra Technologies and Toshiba recently demonstrated on-device gen AI capabilities for enterprise workflows and inventory management at retail self-checkout, respectively. Additionally, Honeywell showcased a Qualcomm-powered Edge AI box for warehouse applications."", ""As we complete the first quarter of fiscal '24 ahead of our expectations, I'm very optimistic about Qualcomm's trajectory and the opportunities ahead. The fundamentals of our growth drivers remain unchanged, our diversification strategy is working, and we're making significant progress across mobile, automotive, computing, XR, edge networking, industrial IoT, and more. At the upcoming Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we will provide an update on our cellular modem and connectivity leadership, as well as on our overall scale of Snapdragon gen AI. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash."", 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our first fiscal quarter earnings. We are pleased to announce strong non-GAAP results above the high end of guidance with revenues of $9.9 billion and EPS of $2.75. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBIT margin of 74% were at the high end of guidance, deflecting slightly higher handset units."", 'QCT delivered revenues of $8.4 billion and EBIT margin of 31%, both above the high end of guidance, reflecting strength in handsets and automotive revenues. QCT EBIT margin includes the benefit of revenue scale, stronger product mix, and operating discipline. Handset revenues of $6.7 billion were higher than our prior expectations primarily due to the increased demand driven by the acceleration of Android flagship launches with our Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform. Notably, our Android handset revenues from Chinese OEMs exceeded our expectations of greater than 35% sequential growth.', ""IoT revenues of $1.1 billion reflect the industrywide challenges we've previously outlined. We achieved record automotive revenues of $598 million which grew by 12% sequentially, reflecting the increased content in new vehicle launches with our Snapdragon digital chassis platform. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% sequentially to $2.1 billion and included the benefit of accelerated implementation of cost actions that we had previously outlined for the first half of fiscal '24. Lastly, we returned $1.7 billion to stockholders during the quarter, including $784 million in stock repurchases and $895 million in dividends."", ""Before turning to second fiscal quarter guidance, I'll update you on global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units. We estimate that global units declined by mid-single-digit percentage in calendar '23 relative to calendar '22, an improvement from our prior expectations due to the recent stabilization in demand. For calendar '24, we estimate that global handset units will be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. This estimate includes expected growth of high single digit to low double-digit percentage in 5G handsets."", 'Turning to guidance for the second fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $8.9 billion to $9.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.20 to $2.40. The sequential decline in revenues and non-GAAP EPS relative to the first fiscal quarter will be driven by seasonality for a modem-only handset customer in both QTL and QCT. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and EBIT margins of 69% to 73%.', 'In QCT, we expect revenues of $7.6 billion to $8.2 billion and EBIT margins of 27% to 29%. For QCT handset revenues coming off a strong performance in the first fiscal quarter, we anticipate Android revenues will be approximately flat quarter over quarter. On a sequential basis, we expect QCT IoT revenues to grow by mid- to high single-digit percentage with QCT automotive revenues slightly down, consistent with the trend in the prior year. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $2.2 billion.', 'This reflects typical calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs. In closing, very pleased to start our fiscal year with strong execution and financial performance. In QTL, as Cristiano outlined, we are pleased to have extended several key license agreements. We do not expect any material change in QTL licensing revenue run rate as a result of these extensions.', 'In QCT, our technology differentiation will accelerate with our on-device gen AI leadership and introduction of our custom Qualcomm Oryon CPU. We also remain well-positioned to execute on our diversification strategy by extending our technology portfolio to deliver industry-leading products across automotive and IoT. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.', 'Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Thank you, Akash. Operator, we are now ready for questions.', '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] One moment please for the first question. The first question is from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan.', 'Please proceed with your question.', 'Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the results here. Maybe if I can start with AI and particularly the launch of the Samsung S24. Now you have some incremental sort of experience in terms of devices launching in the market and the performance and consumer reception you're seeing to that. So, I know you outlined adoption of 3G, 4G, but any way of giving us some flavor of what you're thinking in terms of adoption of these AI devices or AI on edge in terms of the smartphone market? How similar or different will that curve look like relative to 5G adoption? And any insights from the sort of pipeline you're working on will be helpful for us."", 'And I have a follow-up. Thank you.', 'Cristiano Amon -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hello, Samik. Thanks for the question. This is Cristiano. Look, it's early, but I think we're definitely excited about what we see in the beginning."", ""It's not only unique to the Galaxy S24 that has a number of now use cases running gen AI on the device. I mentioned a few of in my prepared remarks, like translation. And you have a much more effective assistance in a number of different applications. We're going to see productivity coming."", ""But we'll also see that happening with some of our other customers from China launching a number of models. So, I think we have a large number now of models being ported into our hardware for gen AI. I think we're starting to see the beginning of new use cases. Reviews have been positive, and we are happy with we've seen the results following the launch."", 'I think we need to monitor the situation. But eventually, at a minimum, is going to have a favorable impact on mix, which is a trend that we continue to see premium and high tier with more computing power. It is the fastest-growing segment in the handset market.', 'Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Yeah. OK. Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, the -- and the Android OBX customers or the Chinese OEMs you work with, they exceeded your expectation in the fiscal first quarter.', ""But as you're looking to the second quarter, you're guiding to a more flattish trajectory here. I know the industry has sort of been looking at inventory refill from those customers as well, driving some of the momentum. So, just wondering if you can give us an update in terms of what you're seeing from those customers. And if at all, Huawei and their reemergence in the market is starting to have an impact in terms of volume or market share for these customers as well in the context of your flat guide for them for quarter over quarter."", 'Thank you.', 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Samik, it's Akash. As we have said previously, as we entered fiscal '24, our view was that Android channel inventory had largely normalized. And so as we go through the year, we typically see normal build bleed cycle around handset launches."", ""So, that's kind of the phase we are in from our perspective. In the first quarter, what we saw was higher demand due to the acceleration of Android flagship launches with our new chip, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. And we saw very strong demand across all the major Android OEMs. And so happy, of course, with that traction and that momentum carries over to the second quarter as well."", ""And that's what you're seeing both in our results and our going forward. In terms of your comment on Huawei, really what we've seen since Huawei 5G launch is that the premium tier TAM in China has expanded. And so we're continuing to see strong demand from our customers post that launch."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.', 'Matt Ramsay -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Thank you very much, guys. Good afternoon. I guess for my first question, Cristiano, it was good to hear, I guess, the formal announcement of an extension with your partnership with Samsung. And you mentioned, I think, in your prepared script that it started with 2024 devices, but I assume it's longer than that."", ""So, maybe you could give us a little context as to the length and any details you can share on the new agreement. You guys obviously have your new custom CPUs coming into the Snapdragon road map and some expanded MCU product as well. So, we see kind of what the split is of share in the flagship at Samsung currently, but I'm just trying to understand a bit more about what this means for on a go-forward basis. Thanks."", 'Cristiano Amon -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks for the question, Matt. The agreement that we announced at this earnings call, it is a multiyear agreement. We're not disclosing the duration, but there are several years into that agreement. And I think your observation is correct."", ""I think it starts in 2024. I think as you look at the launch of Galaxy S24 is a good proxy on how we should think about the agreement between us and Samsung. But most important is the thing that you outlined. Our road map is getting stronger over time, especially with our custom CPU coming to mobile, and we're aiming to have the leadership position in the mobile performance on CPU."", ""And our NPU continue to expand as I mentioned before, we're just at the beginning of the gen AI transition. I think in summary, we're very pleased with our relationship with Samsung, and it's a very long-term relationship with this customer."", 'Matt Ramsay -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Got it. I guess my follow-up question is one for Akash. First of all, Akash, congratulations on the new COO hat. Well done.', 'But my question is around margins. And I noticed that even with the IoT business down dramatically, there was some improvement in sequential gross margin in the quarter and back above 30% in QCT operating margins. So, maybe you could discuss some of the moving parts with margins in the business because it was a -- pleasantly a bit better than I had modeled, and I kind of want to see what might be sustainable or what actions you took on a go-forward basis on both the gross and the operating side. Thanks.', 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Matt, and thanks for the well wishes. I'm looking forward in this new role to working with Cristiano and the executive team to kind of deliver on our long-term priorities. And of course, I'll continue to remain committed to my CFO role, working closely with the team here and maintaining consistency and transparency and looking forward to seeing a lot of you at upcoming events. On the margin side, what you saw in the first quarter is really the fact that our gross margins were stronger because the mix was richer."", 'We had a higher set of premium tier launches coming through and that impacted our volume, and we benefited from that mix -- richer mix. And if you look at our second quarter guide, we are guiding largely in line with how our first quarter came in. So, that was obviously great to see. From an operating margin perspective, in addition to the strength in the gross margins, obviously, the revenue scale and the actions we took on the opex also benefited.', ""And so we were extremely happy to deliver 31% operating margin in QCT and really focused on delivering to the long-term target we've outlined to the investors."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.', 'Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on extending some of the licensing deals. I guess, just want to jump a little bit into the IoT business, the three segments.', 'I assume, consumer is still weaker. But can you update us kind of how the inventory bleed is trending for the three business within IoT? And then within that question, too, just on the recovery of IoT, can you share with us the X Elite ramp and how material this might become for IoT, say, in the next one to two years?', 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Maybe I'll address the first part and then Cristiano can talk through the X Elite question. From an IoT inventory perspective, what we have seen is stabilization really on the consumer side. As you know, we were one of the first to call out the weakness in IoT, and now we're seeing it go through both on the industrial and the edge networking side. And consistent with our previous comments, we think the first quarter was the bottom for our IoT revenue stream."", ""We're guiding second quarter up mid- to high single digits. Second half of the fiscal year, as we see the inventory channel kind of normalizing and end markets kind of benefiting from that, we're excited about what our product portfolio can bring. And overall, lots of opportunities for us there. In my mind, there's significant uncertainty, but we are cautiously optimistic, and I think we have a great product portfolio as we look forward."", 'Cristiano Amon -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Look, your question about X Elite in PC. It's too early. We're tracking to the launch of products with this chipset tied with the next version of Microsoft Windows that has a lot of the Windows AI capabilities. We're still maintaining the same date, which is driven by Windows, which is mid-2024, getting ready for back-to-school."", ""What we're excited about it is since we announced that at Tech Summit showing the performance of the product and the AI capabilities, design traction continues to increase. So, we had increased the number of designs since last quarter. and we continue to march forward toward the launch. We like that everybody is now talking about on-device AI on PC."", ""That's where we started this journey with X Elite. And I think that proved to be a tailwind to the opportunity for us in PCs."", 'Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks. And maybe, Cristiano, just a quick follow-on question. Just on the auto business, how should we think about the ramp of that business over the next one to two years? You've talked about a lot of design win activity and digital chassis ramping this year."", 'But with ADAS coming into the model, how might that business ramp toward your target in 2026?', 'Cristiano Amon -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""No, absolutely. Thank you for your question. Look, let me step back a little bit and say we're extremely pleased with our performance in auto, especially when you look at the overall market. Right now, you look at Qualcomm results with record revenues and very strong, I think, year-over-year growth."", ""In 2023, in this year that just closed, we launched 75 models with our silicon with a significant improvement in silicon content as it relates to those immersive cockpits and in many cases, processing for safety. So, we're very happy with the business. And I think the answer to your question is we are on track to meet our targets that we set on the Auto Investor Day of $4 billion and $9 billion, respectively, I think for '26 at the end of the decade. So, we're on track for that."", ""And the next quarter, we're going to give you an update on the design win pipeline that continues to grow."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.', 'Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, given that you've got Android, Android was pretty strong in December, and it's flat into March. How are you thinking about June seasonality given all these trends and moving pieces? I know it's usually down a bit for March, but I guess in the current environment, how are you thinking about June seasonality?"", 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Stacy, it's Akash. No change to the shape of the year comments that we made last time. Following second quarter, we do expect third quarter to be the lowest quarter. It's one of the quarters where we do not have any significant flagship launches."", 'And as a result, you kind of see a decline in third quarter then growth back into the fourth quarter. When you look at second to third quarter, we expect a trend consistent with the last two years. First half, obviously benefited from this acceleration of launches for Android and pretty happy with that. And I think it sets us up as we look forward in terms of both content growth with our strong road map and just positioning overall in the handset market.', 'Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Got it. And so my follow-up. I just want to ask about Huawei. Was Huawei still completely out of the model in December? And is it out of the model in the March guide?', 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. So, as we've said in the past, Stacy, we do have a 4G license to ship to Huawei. And so we've continued to ship based on customer demand. But as you're aware, they have launched a 5G device with their own chip, and that's, I think, their priority going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.', 'Chris Caso -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Yes, thank you. I guess just a question on QTL, and coming from your comments about the global handset market, it sounds like you're a little more optimistic on the 5G market on the year. QTL revenue has been kind of stuck in this range because of where handset units have been. I guess what's the outlook for QTL going forward in the context of what you're expecting for the handset market overall?"", 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, as we outlined for our handset market, when you look at calendar '24, overall market, we expect it to be flat to slightly up. But within that, 5G, obviously, is our target market, especially for the chip business. We expect that to be high single digit to low double digit up on a year-over-year basis."", ""Within QTL, I will stick with the guidance we have given before. We think there's a scale to the business that's aligned with the handset market and the two will move in line. And then on the extensions of the license, I just wanted to make sure that I said this in my prepared remarks, but just to confirm. As a result of the extension, we do not expect any material change in our QCT licensing revenue run rate."", ""So, it's consistent with the program. In the QTL licensing revenue run rate, it's consistent with the program."", 'Chris Caso -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Great. That's helpful. As a follow-up. Cristiano, I wonder if you could speak to sort of the decision to reengage in custom cores with Oryon."", ""And what outcome you expect of that? I mean, it sounds like that's been one of the reasons or one of the things behind the renewal of the Samsung agreement. What sort of change in the market, because Qualcomm did custom cores in the past? And what do you expect to get out of that in terms of market share and content and such?"", 'Cristiano Amon -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Chris, for your question. Look, it's consistent, I think, with the strategy we outlined, I think, following the acquisition of NUVIA. In the past, Qualcomm has been designing now its own custom cores. And I think the first instantiation of that was for PCs."", ""Actually, if you remember, in the past, that was the key motivation as we embark on this journey to create a leading SoC for laptops for the Windows ecosystem. We needed to have the performance leadership and we needed to design our own CPU to deliver the results that we did with X Elite. Now we're taking that across the entire road map. Your observation is correct."", ""As we take that into mobile next, we're seeing significant interest from our partners as it truly becomes a leadership position in the marketplace now across all cores, not only graphics and AI but also CPU. And we're not stopping there. Following smartphone, it's going to go into our automotive business, and we're excited about what the team has accomplished to date. Oryon is really well-positioned to be the leading CPU core in the industry."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.', 'Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Thanks a lot. Can you talk about restocking in China? It looks like the China Android, obviously, was up a ton and it's being guided flat. Your peer was a bit cautious on this. Do you think you're shipping that to consumption? And do you think you're going to ship to consumption through the rest of the year? And then I had another question."", 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Tim, consistent with what I said earlier in the call. I think we were kind of largely at normalized inventory for Android entering the fiscal year. What you saw in the December quarter, at least for us, to a large extent, was a build for the various premium tier launches that happened during the period.', ""And so we do expect normal build bleed cycles through the year as devices launch. But that's kind of the framework with which we are operating going forward."", 'Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Got it. And then now that you have the modem for longer for this one flagship customer, one can envision a scenario where maybe you can leverage that into some new RF content that you have not had in the past. Is this a scenario? I mean, it seems like it could add $1 billion maybe. I mean you were sort of running to $4 billion a year in your RFFE business prior to stopping to tell us what that is.', 'So, it seems like that is something you could potentially leverage the reliance on your modem business. Thanks.', 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Tim, I'd say that's a conversation, obviously, that we will talk to the customer about. It's a part of our portfolio, and we'll make it available if they're interested."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.', 'Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Hi, guys. Thanks. May I ask a couple of questions and, Akash, congrats on the COO role. The first one is on the opex side of things.', 'You guys did a great job in the calendar fourth quarter and you gave the guidance for the fiscal second quarter. How should we think about that for the remainder of the year, given your commentary on kind of doubling down on some of the opportunistic investments to diversify the company, new cores, etc.?', 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Ross, thank you very much. From an opex perspective, really, the way we think about it is any hiring that we do we'll be very selective and focused on really acquiring new skills that are required for diversification. But other than that, we've gone through a reduction recently. We think we're at scale to a large extent, and we're committed to operating discipline."", 'Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Great. And I guess for my follow-up. I noticed in the 10-Q, you had a new 10% customer, I think it was a 14% customer. I don't expect you to name who that is."", 'But is that a reflection of the strong China demand that you talked about in the continuation of good future growth opportunities? Or was there any one-time aspect of that customer, whoever it may be, popping up in the quarter?', 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', 'I think the way you framed it in your first theory is a reasonable way of thinking about it.', 'Operator', ""Our next question is coming from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question."", ""Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst"", ""Hi, Thanks for taking the question and just passing on my congratulations to Akash as well. I just wanted to ask on the ASP side for Android. You're obviously kind of characterizing a market that's flattish into March, kind of the bottom in June and then improving from there. But you benefited from some good mix in the beginning of the fiscal year here."", ""Could you talk about what you would expect from a mix perspective as you go to the back half? Would you see the same kind of strength on the ASP side that you've kind of seen over the past year? That would be really helpful to understand. Thank you."", 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. So, if you think about premium flagship launches for our OEMs, a lot of the launches happen in the holiday time frame just before the holidays, going into Chinese New Year as well. And so you've seen a lot of those happen. We do have some significant launches through the middle of the year, but obviously, the next big launch goes into the holiday season, starting with Apple and then going into the Android launches."", ""So, that's the typical cadence. Now, just to confirm, that's just the premium tier we are talking about. Of course, there are other tiers and including the high tier, where we have very significant presence and that does drive a significant portion of the launches that happened through the year and also our revenue base."", ""Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst"", ""Helpful. And then just on the auto business. You've clearly seen some weaker data points just out of the ecosystem. Can you explain why your auto business may not be levered to some of like the ADAS areas where you've seen a particular weakness of late? And like when do those ADAS and wins start layering on?

Thank you."", 'Cristiano Amon -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'This is Cristiano. Look, the automotive story of Qualcomm is primarily driven by share gains as models with our silicon, part of our pipeline started to materialize into revenue. And the way you should think about it, historically, a lot of the revenue was telematics. Now you see the largest component being a lot of the fully immersive digital cockpits on the car.', 'And we already have some revenue from ADAS processing. You see a lot of cars, for example, in China with both ADAS and autonomy with our processor. You see some of our customers in the United States with our processor. And I think that continues to grow.', ""As we get toward our 2026 revenue target, you're probably going to see very healthy components of all of those elements."", 'Operator', 'Our final question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.', 'Tal Liani -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""I have two follow-ups on answers or questions you had before. The first one is Samsung. On one hand, there is a new contract. On the other hand, Samsung is going to use their own more in '24 versus '23."", ""So, net-net, are you expecting revenues of Samsung to go up or down in '24 versus '23? What are your expectations of share losses within -- can you frame it for us? And the second question is on the auto business. You had a phenomenal quarter. It's very different from the other auto companies. Most other auto companies had weakness."", 'What is the strength related to? Meaning is it share gain with certain customers? Is it new product? Or can you just put some color on the strength, the relative strength, versus the others? Thanks.', 'Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Tal, it's Akash. So, on Samsung and this is a conversation about the premium tier, I assume. In G S23, we did have global share. In the G S24 that just launched and consistent with what we said on the last quarter, we expect to have a majority share based on the model split between us and Exynos."", ""As Cristiano indicated in his prepared remarks, one of the benefits of the agreement that we did with them is it gives us predictability on our position within the premium tier going forward. And then from a content perspective, there's clearly content expansion happening. And this is really when you look at our premium tier road map, not just with gen AI coming in, our custom CPU cores coming in as well, but then also across other technologies. As consumers demand more capability, we see our content and our ASP both continue to grow."", ""Switching over to your second question on automotive. You should really think -- the way to think about our automotive business is we're tied to the launch of new cars. Clearly, the industry is going through a transformation, digitization of cars, and we are right at the intersection of that transformation. We are benefiting as cars put in more infotainment content for experience within the car."", ""More ADAS content comes into the car as well. And really, we get to benefit from all those intersection points in the car, and we're increasing the content as new cars launch. So, that's the maybe a disconnect between some of our peers, what they're seeing and what we're seeing. Stepping back, I mean, clearly, this is an industry that's going through some shorter-term dynamics, so we'll be closely monitoring it."", ""But when you step back, our technology, our position, our products look really good, and we're excited about where we're going."", 'Operator', ""That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?"", 'Cristiano Amon -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. Just in closing, I'd just like to remind everyone, look, as I said, we're happy with the quarter. We see the Android market stabilizing after we've been to '23. That was a year of correction."", 'We like the transition of user experience with gen AI. That could create an opportunity in mobile. This is one of those times for Qualcomm. They are both our Apple and Samsung revenue on the chip side or under contract.', ""We're very happy about that. We continue to move toward stability of the QTL revenue stream with those new agreements. As you look at the growth opportunity, I think the auto results speak for itself. We're now in the IoT segment, really focused on the launch of X Elite."", ""In the PC, we announced a new product for XR. And if you believe that, that market is finally going to get very large scale, we're well positioned with our partnership with Meta, as well as Samsung and Google. And as IoT, especially industrial goes to the correction, we expect that to resume growth. So, we're focused on what we can control, busy at work with the growth and diversification of the company."", ""And I want to say a big thank you for all of our partners and employees that helped us get to this quarter.

The handset market is no longer struggling with a glut, and the market for internet-connected devices — a segment known as the Internet of Things — is passing its lowest point and will soon return to growth, he said.', '“Handsets are getting back to normal,” Amon said. New phones with artificial intelligence functions are exciting, but it’s still difficult to predict when they will capture the imagination of consumers and drive a spike in sales, he said.', 'Qualcomm sales will be $8.9 billion to $9.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter, the company said. That was in line with an average analyst estimate of $9.36 billion. Excluding certain items, profit will be $2.20 to $2.40 a share in the current quarter, versus an average projection of $2.26.', 'Investors have been looking for signs that consumers are upgrading their smartphones at a faster pace.

It now runs until March 2027. The chipmaker also signed a new agreement with Samsung Electronics Co., with the South Korean company agreeing to base future devices on Qualcomm processors.', 'Apple is the world’s largest smartphone maker — after passing Samsung last year — and will give further insights into the state of the industry Thursday. That’s when the company is due to report its quarterly results.', 'While Amon is trying to lessen his dependence on the phone market — with forays into automotive and personal computer chips — Qualcomm’s earnings are still heavily influenced by demand for handsets, particularly in China.', 'In the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 24, profit was $2.75 a share, excluding some items. Revenue was up 5% at $9.9 billion. Analysts had estimated profit of $2.36 and sales of $9.54 billion.', 'The Internet of Things remained a weak spot. Revenue from that business fell 32%.

And Samsung went back a little bit where Qualcomm has more content. And yeah, they beat revenue by 4%.

So it really starts to get interesting in the second quarter as they start building inventory and shipping it to PC makers. They can start selling in the May and June time frame. And I think it'll start off as small, but I see in the next two years, where I could see the company getting 10% market share of notebooks or even more. And those are premium parts with an ASP of around $300."", ""And that's all upside, right? Because Qualcomm is really never put its mark on the PC market. It's been out there, kind of testing stuff. But this is where-- at least based on the recent benchmarks, even compared to the latest and greatest from Intel, they have a very solid design."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Patrick, that's actually where I want to go next is on these PC chips. They've talked a bold game, Patrick, right, I mean, how they're going to outperform rivals like Apple, like Intel. You agree with that?"", ""PATRICK MOORHEAD: So right now, based on some of the I'll call it guerrilla marketing or guerrilla reviews, where a system hasn't shipped yet but they're dropping developer notebooks out there at the reviewers, Qualcomm has a sizable advantage, particularly on the AI side. And then when it comes to even the CPU part, CPU portion, even versus Apple's latest and greatest with the M3. Because if you step back, Apple currently has the highest performance and highest performance per watt part in a notebook. And there are figures coming out that show Qualcomm is even beating that design.""]"

Cold temperatures can sap your charge faster than normal.', ""3. Use a tripod: Shooting the night sky requires a slower camera shutter speed, and using a tripod will help prevent camera shake and give you crisp, sharp images regardless of what type of camera you're using.

Composition: Depending on your location, some ideas to keep in mind for a more breathtaking image are mountains, a tree line, lighted tent, building structures or reflections of the Northern Lights on a lake or pond.

This phrase isn't exclusively for the corporate business world. Don't miss out on getting the most out of your Northern Lights experience because you're too cold to enjoy it!

""Will that start to free up some resale inventory? I think so. And I think that\'s probably helpful against the backdrop of we continue to be undersupplied in the country.

And there does need to be a generational shift here that mortgage rates in the 5% for the long term\xa0are still really good low rates for a long-term investment like your home.""', 'As rates soften, it has sparked a debate over whether homebuilders should pull back on incentives, such as mortgage rate buydowns, where the builder effectively lowers the rate on the loan by paying a portion of the costs. PulteGroup isn’t changing its strategy on this front.', ""“The reason we've assumed that the incentive load stays about where it is [is] just because affordability continues to be challenged,” Marshall said."", 'Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Moret', ""Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3.This quarter, we saw double-digit sequential growth in orders, with all business segments and regions up from the trough in Q4 of last year. While we are continuing to see the impact of excess inventory in the channel, the underlying demand from machine builders and end-users remain strong.Total sales were up 3.6% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 1% in the quarter, led by North America. China was the single largest drag on our shipments. Currency translation increased sales by over 1 point, and acquisitions contributed almost 1.5 points of growth.Our organic sales did come in below our expectations, largely due to the timing of our recovery to a more normal product book-and-bill process. As a source of our demand shifts from older backlog to new orders that need to be shipped as soon as they are received, we are working through some lingering shortages and line constraints. Our supply chain team is expected to complete this transition in Q2 with little impact on the full year.In our Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were down 4.5% versus prior year. While product shipments in this segment experienced the biggest supply chain constraints in the quarter, we were able to offset some of that impact with strong performance from our configure-to-order businesses and from recent acquisitions.Our Clearpath and Cubic acquisitions had a strong quarter, both on top line and bottom line, showcasing the tremendous value these offerings are bringing to our customers across new verticals and applications. Last quarter, I talked about our presence in datacenter build-outs, and Cubic's momentum with large cloud service providers continues to fuel our growth in this end-market. I'll touch on some of the important Clearpath wins later on the call.Software & Control organic sales increased 4% year-over-year and were in line with our expectations. Logix continues to demonstrate unique value in the marketplace, and we've made some major software investments in this segment over the last few years. We are seeing the value from this innovation, demonstrated by double-digit sales growth in our cloud-native and on-prem information software offerings.Lifecycle Services organic sales grew over 8% versus prior year, better than we expected. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.13, with strong order activity across solutions, services and our Sensia joint venture. I'm pleased with how our Sensia team is making progress, with profitable growth in the quarter. Q1 orders and sales were up over 25% year-over-year.One of the strategic Sensia wins this quarter was with Mellitah Oil and Gas joint venture, one of the largest oil and gas companies in Libya, Sensia's advanced measurement technology is helping this customer modernize all of their liquid metering skids and establishes Sensia as one of the key players in the region for major metering turnkey solutions.Another highlight of the quarter was our continued growth in ARR. Total annual recurring revenue was up 20% year-over-year, with strong growth across our Plex and fixed SaaS offerings and recurring services, including our growing cybersecurity business. The impact of these contracts on our financial performance is also increasing, especially in a year with relatively low product growth. This quarter, our Plex SaaS platform was selected by EOS Energy, an energy start-up focused on grid scale storage for utility companies. EOS Energy, in partnership with ACRO Automation Systems, has selected Rockwell Automation to provide Plex, MES and QMS information software to complement ACRO's battery manufacturing solution built on Rockwell's control platform. ACRO is currently building out the first state-of-the-art manufacturing line that will manufacture EOS Energy's next-gen Z3 batteries. Segment margin of about 17% and adjusted EPS of $2.04 were both down versus prior year. The adjusted EPS was below our expectations, and Nick will discuss this further in a few minutes.Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 industry segment performance. Before we get into the individual verticals, keep in mind that the more product-intensive industries were the most impacted by planned shipments moving to Q2 and later in the year.Our discrete sales were down 10% year-over-year. Within discrete, automotive sales were down high single digits. While auto customers are focused on near-term profitability and temporary slowdown in EV demand, they continue to fund new EV and battery CapEx programs. In addition to these investments, we are seeing increased activity across our traditional ICE and plug-in hybrid platforms as brand owners and tier suppliers are looking to diversify their exposure in response to consumer demand and infrastructure limitations.As you know, Rockwell has a substantial installed base with these established automotive customers and is well positioned to capture additional market share regardless of the application.This quarter, our Logix platform was selected by AKASOL BorgWarner, a global battery producer and automotive tier supplier, developing innovative battery manufacturing processes for their production plants in Seneca, South Carolina and Darmstadt, Germany. This customer plans to increase their production volume in Europe and North America and scale to more plants globally. Another exciting automotive win this quarter came from Clearpath Robotics, where a large brand owner will be using over 100 of our auto, autonomous mobile robots in their U.S. subassembly applications.Semiconductor sales were also down high single digits versus prior year. While the industry is still navigating through a myriad of challenges, including geopolitical risk, excess memory capacity and workforce shortages, we continue to see new announcements in orders for greenfield projects and legacy fab upgrades, along with continued momentum in our wafer transport solutions. Within our e-commerce and warehouse automation industry, sales declined mid-teens and were in line with our expectations. Customers across many verticals continue to modernize their existing operations to match the current market's needs. In addition to a strong funnel of these warehouse transformation projects, we're starting to see renewed CapEx plans from our e-commerce customers for fulfillment center builds later in fiscal year '24 and in fiscal year '25.Moving to our Hybrid Industries. Within this industry segment, growth in life sciences and tire were offset by declines in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were down high single digits versus prior year. Given the mix of products serving this customer segment, our Q1 performance in this vertical was most impacted by our internal capacity constraints mentioned earlier on the call. Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see large end-users investing their digital and cyber capabilities across their global footprint.This quarter, we had another sizable Clearpath win at one of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the world, where the customer chose our auto AMRs to replace their existing AGV system to increase throughput and flexibility while enhancing material movement security. It is clear our customers across many industries are focused on augmenting their existing workforce through autonomous and innovative solutions to drive further productivity safety and sustainability in their operations.Life Sciences sales grew 10% in the quarter. Note that our Life Sciences revenue is more weighted to software and services versus products. In addition to our MES and cybersecurity services momentum, we are continuing to see increased investments in high-growth areas such as advanced therapy medicinal products and GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs. Tire was up high single digits.Moving to process. Sales in this industry segment grew over 10% year-over-year, once again led by strong growth in oil and gas, metals and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 25% this quarter. I already mentioned our performance in Sensia, and we continue to see follow-on orders from our customers' decarbonization and digitization projects worldwide.Let's turn to Slide 5 in our Q1 organic regional sales. North America organic sales were up over 4% year-over-year. North American manufacturers are continuing to invest, and we expect this region to be our strongest performing market this year. Latin America was down 0.5 point. EMEA sales were down about 2%. And Asia Pacific sales declined over 7%. Similar to the last few quarters, we continue to see challenges in the Chinese manufacturing economy, with high cancellations and pushouts relative to the rest of the world. Sales in China were down high teens versus prior year.Moving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. We continue to expect our full year orders to grow low single digits versus prior year, with strong sequential growth through the balance of this fiscal year. Factoring our performance through January, our continuous analysis of distributor inventory levels and strong pipeline of customer projects, we are reaffirming our fiscal '24 sales guidance range with organic sales projected to grow 1% at the midpoint.Currency is also expected to increase sales by 1%. And we now expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5 points of growth. ARR is still slated to grow about 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase slightly versus prior year, with significant second half increases coming from increased product volume, spending discipline and the growing benefit of productivity initiatives being taken in Lifecycle Services. Nick will share additional calendarization detail in his section.Adjusted EPS is slated to grow 5% year-over-year at the midpoint, again, weighted to the back half of the year. And we still expect free cash flow conversion of 100%. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. Nick?"", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7, first quarter key financial information.First quarter reported sales were up 3.6% over last year. Q1 organic sales were up 1%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 120 basis points. About 3 points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our expectations. Segment operating margin was 17.3%, compared to 20.2% a year ago. This 290 basis point decrease reflects higher investment spend, mix between products and solutions, and lower supply chain utilization. While our Q1 spend was down sequentially, we had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to an abnormally low investment spend in Q1 of last year.Key areas of year-over-year spending increases include investments in new products, digital infrastructure and commercial resources. I'll comment later on the expected progression of our investment spend when I cover our full year outlook.As Blake mentioned, orders inflected upward sequentially, and we expect strong sequential order growth through the remainder of the year. The expected slope of orders is consistent with what we have discussed over the last couple of quarters.Adjusted EPS of $2.04, down 17% compared to last year, was below our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected sales and lower segment operating margin. The devaluation of the Argentine peso was an additional $0.10 adjusted EPS headwind in Q1. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 18%, slightly above the prior year rate. Free cash flow was negative $35 million, compared to a positive $42 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by higher incentive compensation payout during the quarter, which was tied to our fiscal '23 performance.Working capital decreased in Q1, driven by lower accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 400,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $120 million. On December 31, $800 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Blake discussed our top line performance in the quarter, so I'll focus on our margin performance. As I mentioned earlier, our investment spend in the year-ago quarter was lower than normal as most of the incremental fiscal '23 investments started in Q2 of last year. This resulted in a difficult year-over-year margin comparison in Q1 for both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control.Intelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.2%, compared to 22.4% a year ago. The decrease from prior year was driven by lower sales volume, the timing of prior year investment spend, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive price/cost. Our Clearpath and Cubic acquisitions, both part of Intelligent Devices, are performing well and are making commercial -- and we are making commercial and technical investments here to accelerate profitable growth.Software & Control margin of 25% decreased from 29.2% last year. The lower margin was driven by the timing of prior year investment spend and lower supply chain utilization, partially offset by price/cost.Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.13. Lifecycle Services margin of 10.4% doubled from the year-ago margin of 5.2%. Strong margin performance was driven by higher sales, lower incentive compensation and higher margins in Sensia. We are realizing productivity benefits from Lifecycle Services restructuring actions we took last year, and those benefits are coming in as expected.The next slide, 9, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal '23 to Q1 fiscal '24. Core performance was down $0.10 on a 1% organic sales increase as positive price/cost was more than offset by negative product mix and lower supply chain utilization. Higher investment spend was a $0.40 EPS headwind. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects a lower projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year.The impact from acquisitions was a $0.10 headwind and aligned with our expectations. The year-over-year impact from currency was a $0.05 headwind, with the $0.10 headwind from the Argentine peso revaluation more than offsetting the positive impact from other currencies. The $0.05 -- the net $0.05 currency headwind was offset by a $0.05 tailwind from interest expense. Share count and tax rate were each immaterial to the year-over-year change in EPS this quarter.Let's now move on to the next slide, 10, guidance for fiscal '24. We are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '24 of reported sales growth of 0.5% to 6.5%, and organic sales growth in the range of negative 2% to positive 4%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we now expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth, up from 100 basis points in our prior guidance, as the growing pipeline of projects from Clearpath is leading to higher expected growth. Given this improvement, Clearpath is now expected to dilute adjusted EPS by $0.20 versus our prior expectation of $0.25.We now expect a full year currency tailwind of 100 basis points, down from 150 basis points in our prior guide because projections for the Euro and the Canadian dollar have weakened slightly for the year. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year.We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. And we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $12 to $13.50. We expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This reflects our continued expectation that inventory days on hand will drop to approximately 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24, compared to 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the first half to be well below 100%, mostly tied to the higher incentive compensation payment made in Q1 relative to our fiscal year '23 performance, and higher income tax payments related to the realized capital gain on the sale of our stake in PTC, as well as our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act transition tax payment.From a calendarization perspective, we expect Q2 sales dollars and segment margin to be similar to Q1 levels. We previously expected the lead times on our last constrained products would return to normal by the end of Q1. This is now being pushed back to the middle of the year. This means that our split between first half and second half revenue will be even more weighted towards the second half. Our plan was and continues to be for balanced spend across the 4 quarters of fiscal year '24, compared to our upward trajectory of spend in fiscal year '23, as confidence in supply chain recovery pace grew. Given the split of sales between first and second half, that means first half margins will be noticeably lower compared to the year prior and second half margins noticeably higher. We expect margins in Q2 to remain similar to what they were in Q1 and then increase to the mid-20s in Q3 and Q4. That expansion in margin is virtually all -- driven virtually all by revenue returning to levels consistent with end demand. We anticipate investment spend to be relatively flat across the 4 quarters of fiscal year '24.From a year-on-year perspective, Q2 and Q3 increases in investment spend will be approximately $10 million each and then a year-over-year decrease in Q4. A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is expected to be about $120 million. And we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.1 million shares. We expect to deploy between $300 million and $500 million to share repurchases during the year.With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Thanks, Nick. Despite geopolitical volatility, our detailed discussions with our distributors, machine builders and end-users point to fairly healthy market conditions. Our outlook for fiscal year '24 is based on an acceleration of new product orders as distributors and machine builders reduce excessive inventory. Our operations team is working around the clock to ensure we can convert these new orders into shipments at lead times that are as good or better than pre-pandemic lead times.We continue to gain share across our key platforms, especially here in North America. We are seeing early orders from customer projects facilitated by economic stimulus, and automation continues to be an important way to maximize the productivity of available workers. Our recent acquisitions are performing well on both revenue and cost, with Clearpath Robotics being a standout addition to Rockwell's portfolio. We've seen multimillion dollar wins across diverse end-markets, including automotive, food and beverage, and even warehousing and logistics. And this is just the beginning.We have a unique portfolio of high-value assets that we've built and bought with the best partner ecosystem in the business. Our focus is now to integrate these elements as only a pure-play can, growing share, profitability and cash flow by driving efficiency and synergy.Aijana, we'll now begin the Q&A session."", 'Aijana Zellner', ""Thanks, Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to 1 question and a quick follow-up. Julianne, let's take our first question."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.', 'Andrew Alec Kaplowitz', ""Nick, you mentioned that your orders were up double digits sequentially. Could you tell us where backlog was ending Q1? And regardless, you did reiterate your low single-digit order growth guide for FY '24. So are you beginning to see a more substantial turn in orders here in fiscal Q2 as your distributors bottom out their inventory levels? And if so, what end-markets would you say are inflecting the most?"", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes, Andy, we ended last year with a backlog of $4.1 billion all in, and it went down high single digits in -- during the first quarter. In terms of what we're seeing with orders, you're exactly right, we're seeing an inflection up in the orders from the Q4 trough. And we're expecting that to continue into the second quarter of double-digit growth into the second quarter. In terms of where that -- where we're seeing that, I'll turn that over to Blake."", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Yes. Let me just mention additionally, Andy, that distributor inventory is coming down. So as we've talked about before, we have good visibility into our distributor inventory based on our channel model, and we are seeing that going down as we expected. As we're seeing the orders, it's a good mix across industries, including some of the industries that were pressured by the lower shipments in the first quarter like auto and food and beverage, we're also seeing it across the entire portfolio, as we talked about annual recurring revenue, very strong from a software and a high-value services standpoint and other aspects of Lifecycle Services.But we do expect that that order recovery is going to be broad-based across our key industries, including in discrete and hybrid, to complement the continuing good performance in process such as oil and gas."", 'Andrew Alec Kaplowitz', ""Very helpful, guys. And then you didn't change your adjusted EPS guidance for the year, but you did mention that you expect modest EPS growth that's back-end loaded. I know, Blake, you suggested that your supply chain team should catch up with a more book-and-bill type environment in Q2, and Nick, you talked about the margin jump starting in Q3. But maybe you could talk more about your confidence level in getting that margin jump you expect in Q3. And does a relatively slow start for EPS for the year suggests modest EPS growth for FY '24, meaning somewhat lower in that $12 to $13.50 EPS range? Or are you not trying to single that?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""No. Well, we're reaffirming the guide that we introduced in November. The significant increase in EPS in the second half of the year is based on the increased volume. You'll recall last year, we went from roughly $2 billion of shipments in the first quarter of fiscal year '23 to an exit of around $2.5 billion. And we're expecting to see something similar in this year, in fiscal year '24, from the Q1 that we were talking about of $2 billion roughly of shipments to around $2.5 billion at the end of the year. That's what's going to drive the higher margins and EPS. Last year, the causal for that ramp was based on getting chip supply. This year, it's the ramp of orders."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.', 'Jeffrey Todd Sprague', ""Can we just drill back into the supply chain comments? They seem inconsistent, right, when we think about it. Revenues this quarter are lower than revenues in the prior 3 quarters, right? So you're getting a lot more out the door the prior 3 quarters. So can you just elaborate a little bit more on what exactly happened in supply chain? What kind of bottlenecks you're dealing with? Are they at the Rockwell factory level? Are they at a supplier level? Just please clear that up for us, if you could."", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Sure, Jeff. So what we're seeing is the shift in the timing going from a dynamic of shipments that's been based entirely on reducing large amounts of backlog, to a recovery to a more normal product book-and-bill process. So the big shipments that we saw over the last year were based on chips coming in with a very visible really mass of past-due backlog that was in a relatively concentrated set of SKUs for us. So whether it was variable speed drives or motion control or Logix I/O. We had very good visibility into what we needed to ship as soon as we got the chips.We're seeing the shift in Q1, which should be complete in Q2, of moving to a more normal distribution of having the vast majority of our shipments in the quarter based on book-and-bill, that is, new orders coming in that get turned around in the quarter. The things that hampered us in Q1 were the lingering tail of those past-due backlog items that we talked about taking a little bit longer than Q1 to clear out, as well as some continuing component challenges, and then the shift to being able to build safety stock to be able to handle those incoming orders.That progress continues in Q2. We expect to be substantially complete with that in the quarter. But that's the difference of what we were shipping out last year versus what we're shipping out now. I should also mention, we've talked in the past about our capacity being over $10 billion. And that remains true. Our capacity to ship in terms of physical plant and labor is over $10 billion. And that's going to be important as we continue to grow."", 'Jeffrey Todd Sprague', ""And then again, if we could just talk a little bit more detail, maybe it's for Nick. I think you're pretty explicit on sort of the margins for Q2. Maybe just give us a little bit of color though on kind of the mix and what's driving that. I mean it does sound like you're expecting some sequential revenue lift in Q2. So why would margins be roughly similar to Q1?"", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes. We're expecting dollar revenue to be very similar in Q2 to what it was in Q1, and a very similar margin. The mix of what we're selling in Q1 to Q2, in Q1, we had more of it coming out of our backlog and less from current quarter book-and-bill. In Q2, that will be shifting -- that mix will be shifting to more coming out of current quarter orders as we continue to bring that backlog down.On the margin front, many of the things that we saw in first quarter, we're going to be keeping investment spend very similar to what -- in Q2 very similar to what it was in Q1. The year-on-year change of that will come down, but the sequential will be almost identical.And then mix will probably not be as -- was a drain -- was a negative to us in Q1. And we expect mix to continue as a negative into Q2, both from a segment mix where we expect higher growth in -- our highest growth in Lifecycle Services, but also within segments where we're seeing more of our sales in Intelligent Devices coming from our configure-to-order business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.', 'Andrew Burris Obin', ""Just to follow up, I guess, on Jeff's question. If we go back to your Analyst Day, I think the message is that this is a transition year, and then revenue growth mean-reverts to plan next year, which means it's going to accelerate very nicely. Can you just expand, how do you make sure that, over the next 18 months, Rockwell can actually deliver the volumes? Are there any structural changes that you're making to your internal processes and supply chains to sort of ensure a smooth ramp-up?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Yes, Andrew, there is. As I mentioned before, the first is to make sure that we have the fixed assets in place. We've been working on that for over a year, which allowed us to get to the $9 billion worth of shipments last year, which was a fairly healthy step-up from prior. And we've kept going to where, today, we feel like we have over $10.5 billion worth of capacity in terms of the assets. As you'll recall, we're a fairly asset-light manufacturing process. It's assembly, it's test fixtures, it's surface mount machines and so on. And we're making sure, not only in our organic business, but also with the acquisitions where we're seeing such strong growth, that we're making the investments to be able to fuel that growth.Labor is the other area. We have adequate product labor in place currently. We are continuing to ramp up based on the growth in our engineered-to-order business and the share gains that we're seeing there, the labor through the year in that. And in some cases, we're holding labor in place to make sure that it's there as we see that order ramp continue through the year.From a structural standpoint, we are working through ways to drive efficiency, to get scale throughout the organization. Some of this is standard lean concepts. But it's also adding the things that we've learned about needing resilience in terms of redundancy across multiple plants, in some cases, redundant sources of supply to be able to reduce the dependence on single suppliers in single parts of the world. So we're working all of those plays in operations as well as with the engineers.Andrew, going back to your first comment, we do expect to be exiting fiscal year '24, as we go through this transition, with margins that are very encouraging, as Nick talked about, as well as volume that supports continued growth in '25 and beyond."", 'Andrew Burris Obin', ""Just a follow-up question. We've been getting some incoming calls, just folks concerned about slowdown in packaging CapEx. I think there were specific headlines. Also mining, another area of concern, I know sort of discrete and process. But can you just comment about these 2 specific markets, maybe a little bit more granularity what you are seeing around the world?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Sure. So for us, packaging is typically being incorporated as part of our vertical industries of food and beverage, consumer packaged goods. And we are seeing the machinery builders in those areas, in Life Sciences as well, I should mention, there's packaging of medicine in Life Sciences, of course. And we are seeing those machine builders, similar to our distributors work, through inventory in their system.It's in a similar kind of profile to what we're seeing with our distributors, in that we expect over the coming few months, that works off and exposes what we continue to see from direct conversations with those customers, with those machine builders strong underlying demand.With respect to mining, we actually are seeing a relative strength in mining in the areas that we focus on. Some of that is driven by materials for batteries. But in general, we do expect to see low single-digit growth in mining in the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.', 'Nigel Edward Coe', ""I'm sorry, I missed a part of the call, Nick, where you were running through the guidance point. Did you call out the degree of order acceleration? I know you called out double-digit growth sequentially. Just wondering if you quantified the order and backlog exiting the quarter."", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes. Yes, I did call some of that out. First, we saw double-digit order growth sequentially in Q1, and we expect double-digit order growth sequentially in Q2. And then further ramp into Q3 and Q4 for orders. And that's being driven by the progress we're seeing with excess inventory in the channel coming out. In terms of the backlog, we ended fiscal year '23 with a backlog of $4.1 billion, and we saw that come down high single-digit percent in the first quarter."", 'Nigel Edward Coe', 'Are we still looking at $3 billion as the point where this stabilizes and where we start to see that real inflection in order rates?', 'Blake D. Moret', ""I'm sorry, the $3 billion?"", 'Nigel Edward Coe', ""Yes, $3 billion of backlog. I think that's what you called out as sort of [normal] level."", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes. What I said on the last call is that we expect the backlog in a more normal range of 30% to 35% of our revenue. I think that we still see that as a good point. I'd say our current projections see us at the high end, closer to the high end of that 30% to 35% range now for fiscal year '24."", 'Nigel Edward Coe', ""Okay. That's great. And then my follow-on question, Nick, is I understand that the mix impacts from Lifecycle services are growing, the Software Control and ID. But maybe the 240 basis points of gross margin compression year-over-year, maybe just unpack that for us in terms of mix versus M&A impacts. Just as curious because that -- given that pricing was 3 points, price/cost positive, that's a study big delta."", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes. So if you look at our press release, we have gross profit down 240 basis points year-on-year. About 1/3 of that is coming from the investment spend that I talked about year-on-year, that that's because our R&D spend is part of that growth prospect. So that's about 1/3 of that decline in the margin there. Our acquisitions, Clearpath and Verve, are 30 basis points are a small part of that. And then the rest of it would be coming from mix and underutilization of our -- underutilization of our supply chain in the first quarter."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.', 'Charles Stephen Tusa', ""So I guess just from a stability perspective on the deliveries. Is there a particular end-market or anything like that that's driving this what kind of looks to be a very choppy outcome on delivery? Is it like are there certain segments of the market or product types that are not maybe flowing as smoothly as they have in the past?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""No. Steve, it's really -- I mean, it is product and it's centered in the Intelligent Devices. So where you have the greatest diversity of SKUs between variable speed drives, motion control. And these are the areas where you're seeing that shift that I mentioned earlier, where we were bringing down a significant amount of past-due backlog, and now we're moving towards what is a more normal book-and-bill environment.But there's no unsurmountable challenges that we don't expect to be resolved in Q2. It was the shift that we saw really Q1 and a little bit into Q2, is that move from having the vast majority of our shipments as past-due backlog moving to more book-and-bill, centered within the Intelligent Devices segment."", 'Charles Stephen Tusa', 'Okay. I guess just also, just, Nick, from an earnings perspective, first half is going to be relatively low, is how much of a linear step-up do you think for 3 and 4Q as we just think about the seasonality here?', 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes. It will really be bringing us where the first 2 quarters of this year are, I'd say, under-reflecting end-demand for our products as that excess inventory is being worked through. And then Q3 and Q4 are getting back to a more normal. So yes, that makes it more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. But given our plans of what we'll be doing from spending, the type of earnings growth, is very consistent with what we expect with that kind of uptick in revenue into Q3 and Q4."", 'Charles Stephen Tusa', ""Okay. And just lastly, just on the orders, we're getting to something in the kind of 1-point, I don't know, 1.6, 1.7 range. Is that about right?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Yes. We haven't given the specific number, Steve. We talked about double-digit sequential growth from the trough in Q4 to Q1, with expected continuing double-digit sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, and really continuing through the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS.', 'Christopher M. Snyder', 'I wanted to ask about the guided step-up in margins from the high teens level in the fiscal second quarter to about mid-20s in the fiscal third quarter. I understand volumes are getting better sequentially, but that implied sequential incremental is much, much sharper than what we would kind of say is normalized for the company. So can you just sort of talk about other drivers of that sequential margin uplift into the back half beyond just volume?', 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes. There's 3 things I'll point out on that, Chris. The vast majority, I'll say 75% of that margin expansion, is just coming from the volume increase in holding investment spending flat across the year.The second and third pieces are pretty equal. One is coming from the improved utilization of our factories that we'll -- and our supply chain that we'll see as a result of that. And then the third is we saw good progress on our Lifecycle services margin, and we expect that to continue, and that's also going to be part of our continued margin expansion from the first half to the second half."", 'Christopher M. Snyder', ""I appreciate that. And then on some of the supply chain constraints you guys called out that weighed on shipments in the first quarter. I don't think I caught it, but could you provide any sort of magnitude on how much sales were impacted by that? And it does not seem like that's coming back in the second quarter. It seems like they are then kind of deferred into the back half of the year. Is that right?"", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes. I would put the -- we had originally guided that we expected low single-digit growth in the first quarter. We came in at 1. So there is -- there's a portion, but it's probably in the $50 million to $70 million range of what we're talking about there. And yes, much of that is going into the second half of the year. That is correct."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.', 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""I just wanted to try and square sort of the comments on capacity utilization and the supply constraints with inventories. I think they're running -- we'll wait for the Q for the end-December balance, but it sounds like those are sort of stable sequentially maybe. And they've been running at a mid-teens share of sales versus sort of 8%, 9% pre-COVID. And they rose a lot the last 12 months even as sales rose.So I just want to understand sort of -- it sounds like inventories to sales, inventory days, should fall in the balance of the year. But do you need sort of some -- is that based on a much faster sell-through out of the plant? You need to sort of underproduce somewhat to get the inventory back down? Or do you think that inventories will stay much higher now as a share of sales medium term than pre-COVID for some reason, even though lead times are normal?"", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes, Julian, there's a few things that will change there. First of all, you know our projection that we're going to move from 140 days of inventory down to 125. That's been there and that's unchanged.Now the mix of that, as we're looking at this shift to more and more of our revenue coming from current quarter orders that we're booking and billing, part of our action plans there is we see some increased needs for safety stock of those finished goods. So as we go through the balance of this year, there will be some places where finished goods go up. But that will be more than offset by the reductions that we're seeing in our components driven by the improved lead times we have for those components as well as our work in progress.So we're expecting, as we progress through '24, just to be seeing that kind of shift. The 125 days will still be well above our pre-pandemic levels where we were typically under 100 days of inventory."", 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""I see. But I guess -- I get it. Sort of 2 years ago, sort of people would have said you need higher inventory because backlogs are very high and you need inventory to sort of satisfy projects and backlog. But now you're saying as you go back towards a more normal book and ship business, that also requires sort of higher inventories. I just want to sort of understand what's kind of changed in the thinking there."", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes. In order to have sufficient inventories to be able to ship products very quickly to our customers and our distributors when they want it, we've been working on getting our products recovery back to where we can ship. Now part of the progress we're making in the next couple of quarters is getting all of our safety stocks on our -- for our finished goods to where we feel they should be in order to make sure we're performing and executing to our customers' expectations. That's part of that plan.And so finished goods will not decline, but we expect all of our decline to be coming in the -- in our raw materials and work in progress."", 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""That's helpful. And just the follow-up on that would be, when you look at your sort of customers and distributors, how are you seeing them managing their inventories of kind of your product? And how are they feeling about those inventory levels today, please?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Yes. We expect our distributors to be carrying a little higher amount of inventory given the customer service challenges that the industry has had over the last couple of years, we expect that equilibrium that distributors get to to be a little higher level than it was pre-pandemic. And that's with very specific discussions with them about how they're thinking about the balance of customer service and working capital.We're also seeing with our machine builders that, as I mentioned before, some of them are still continuing to work down inventory in their own system, but we expect that to be complete over the coming months. I don't know of any difference in the way machine builders are looking at carrying levels of inventory and working capital. But with our distributors, we do expect them to normalize at a little higher level than they would have traditionally."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer.', 'Noah Duke Kaye', ""Thanks very much. I just want to ask one final one on the production constraints. Can you help us understand a little bit better, what is different about the configure-to-order business versus the type of products that you've been working down a backlog? Is there a focus on different lines? Does it require different personnel? Just help us understand some of the actual operational dynamics you are going through as you kind of reconfigure for a more normal book-and-ship environment?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Sure. Let me just clarify that. The shift that's going on that we saw challenges in the first quarter was the move from servicing backlog of products to shipping out book-and-bill of products where the orders come in in the quarter. We continue to have a certain amount of configure-to-order business, our motor control centers, our big drives, our independent cart technology and so on. That isn't representing the biggest challenge to us. Those are very different processes. Those configure-to-order businesses come in with varying degrees of customization specific to a customer.But the big dynamic that we've been talking about in Q1 is the move from a somewhat concentrated list of SKUs that we have backlog building -- that backlog built up because we couldn't get the chips, moving to book-and-bill of a more diverse set of SKUs as we see the largest portion of our shipments coming from orders received in that quarter, not 1 or 2 or 3 quarters prior. So that's the main dynamic that we're working through.You have much less visibility to what's coming in from that book-and-bill profile. So that's one of the changes. And what Nick was talking about in the previous question is we're in the process of building up safety stock in those areas so that we can deal with the ebb and flow of the normal order book, in a quarter being able to turn that around and convert those orders to shipments in the quarter. So those are the processes that are somewhat different from what -- the world we've been living in for the last year or so, to what we're transitioning to and we'll continue to operate in, we hope, for a long time."", 'Noah Duke Kaye', ""Thanks, Blake. If I could ask just one follow-up. I think you're not -- you reiterated your organic industry segment outlook essentially for the full year. Is there any change or shift you've seen in the timing of demand and orders for any of the major segments or subsegments? It does seem like most of the cadence here is really driven by your own production considerations and where channel inventory is. But is there any shift in timing you can see among the end-customers?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Yes. I think you said it right. The largest impact is based on getting those shipments out the door, being able to see the distributors return to equilibrium. We continue to see good activity in process applications. We talked about oil and gas, specialty chemical, mining. These are all areas that are relatively strong.Certainly, we've seen some slowdown in certain of the EV projects, but those projects are continuing. We're continuing to win new business in those areas. And as I talked about in my prepared remarks, in traditional internal combustion engines and in hybrid manufacturing, we have very good readiness to serve in those areas as well, with a lot of experience.So in a year of low growth, we're not seeing any big ebbs and flows in the vertical end-market needs being the predominant factor in any changes through the year."", 'Aijana Zellner', ""Julianne, we'll take one more question."", 'Operator', ""Our last question will come from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", ""First, I just wanted to ask about the back half of the year margin profile. And it does seem like a transition from maybe a higher concentration of a narrower band of products that you would have had shipping out of backlog in '23 compared to more kind of book-and-shipping quarter in '24 is a bit of a mix headwind. And so when we think about back half of '24 margins being better than back half of '23, can you expand on that a little bit? Is it Devices is up, Lifecycle is up, maybe Software & Control is down a bit year-over-year? Just trying to contemplate what could still be a year-over-year mix headwind as you broaden out the book and ship."", 'Blake D. Moret', ""Yes. I think what you're seeing from a positive standpoint is the greater percentage of products as those orders increase through the year. To be sure, we are seeing some headwind based on the comparables with the year where Logix grew over 30% last year as one of our most profitable product lines.But the other point is that, recognizing the puts and takes in this year, we did take cost out beginning in Q4 of the last year. And so that gives us help to being able to push those margins at the exit of '24 higher than they were. That's in -- across our business and functions, most noticeably in Lifecycle Services."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", ""Great. And then just on the sort of channel inventory observations, and it sounds like it's taking a little bit longer than previously anticipated to get channel inventories to targeted levels, what are your observations of why that is in terms of kind of end market demand patterns or maybe a little bit more inventory out there than you appreciated for why it would be more middle of the year versus first half of the year where we would have seen channel inventory correct?"", 'Blake D. Moret', ""We're really talking about variability that could be in the area of weeks or a month. I wouldn't read too much into talking middle of the year versus second quarter. We did see a good double-digit sequential increase in orders in Q1. We expect that again in Q2. January represents a sequential increase based on what we've seen so far from Q1. And so we continue to see that inventory at our distributors coming down pretty much as we expected."", 'Nicholas C. Gangestad', ""Yes. Joe, I'll just add. I mean, we're obviously in close dialogue with all of our distributors, and a high percentage of them are affirming to us that they expect to be done with -- they're reducing excess inventory sometime during Q2 and that they're at an equilibrium point there."", 'Aijana Zellner', ""Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

It gives general cargo — dry goods, hardware, textiles and other everyday items — low priority. Freight forwarders are careful about tendering shipments to the airline because third-party shipments can be left behind when a plane is full of shipments from FedEx customers.', 'Dedicating fixed space to third-party freight would be a big change and a potential threat to other cargo airlines, experts say.', '“If they change strategy and decide that [hypothetically] one third of every FedEx plane, or a group of planes, is now reserved for general heavy cargo and will not be subjected to any offload that would have a huge impact,” said a senior executive at a global freight broker who asked not to be named because of company rules against speaking with the media. “Freight carriers like Cargolux, Qatar Airways, Lufthansa and Emirates, they would not like to see that at all because if you fly freighters you need every single kilo. You don’t have, like FedEx or UPS, another moneymaker, which are the packages.”', 'In the fall of 2022, FedEx launched an initiative to take out $4 billion in structural costs by fiscal year 2025 and redesign the entire parcel distribution network to create greater efficiency. The air and international unit flew fewer hours in 2023, deactivated aircraft until demand returns, accelerated the retirement of older planes and flew more direct routes.', 'In conjunction with its latest quarterly earnings on Dec. 19, management spelled out in more detail how it plans to reconfigure airline operations.', '', 'The new strategy de-emphasizes the hub-and-spoke system originally built for speed and global connectivity. Instead, a three-pronged approach prioritizes density and improved cash flow by better segmenting shipments between owned freighters, partner airlines, road transport and deferred freight.', 'FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam, during a briefing with analysts, characterized the new Tricolor network design as a way to improve efficiency, but internal company communications show it is equally designed to propel Express into sectors in which it has not traditionally operated.', 'The Purple network, consisting of FedEx’s owned aircraft fleet, will underpin Express’ high priority, high-margin international parcel business utilizing the existing hub model. This part of the network consists of direct flights from gateways such as Paris; Cologne, Germany; Osaka, Japan; and Hong Kong feeding the main night sortation hub in Memphis, Tennessee, as well as locations like Indianapolis and Newark, New Jersey.', '“Capturing this priority parcel business is where FedEx Express has historically made its primary profits. However, this worldwide market segment is not projected to grow substantially. Realizing this, over the last 24 months, we have carefully evaluated our network to ensure that our traditional purple tail flying carries as much high-value priority volume as possible and that aircraft gauge and density maximize our load factors,” said Justin Brownlee, senior vice president of flight operations, in a Dec. 21 memo to frontline workers obtained by FreightWaves.', 'A portion of FedEx’s fleet will be reallocated to the so-called Orange network, which will operate off-schedule to carry heavy freight that doesn’t require maximum speed and is better suited for a truck-fly-truck delivery model than flying the entire trip. These planes will fly into primary and regional sortation centers such as Newark and Oakland, California, during the daytime when workers have more time to build dense pallets.', 'The object is to improve aircraft utilization, feed the ground parcel and freight networks, and help decongest hubs before the priority night sortation. Customers can expect transit times of three to five days.', '“Right now, we move all products — parcels and freight pallets, priority and deferred — in the same way, through an air network that is timed and structured to deliver priority goods around the world in the most expedited way possible. However, the global market is broader than just priority parcel shipments, and FedEx needs to restructure our international network to better capture freight shipments (pallets) and less time-sensitive parcels (including e-commerce) in a profitable manner,” Brownlee said. “By adjusting our network to best serve the entirety of the global market, we can broaden our customer base and profitably grow revenue, which will ultimately lead to growth at our airline and increased flying.”', 'Orange addresses an $80 billion deferred market, of which FedEx only has a 1% share.', '“With this structure, FedEx can provide the outstanding service we are known for to customers', 'needing international standard air freight logistics and do so with a cost structure that enables our sales teams to aggressively compete in this space,” Brownlee said.', 'Upper management’s previous comments about reducing use of nearly 30 widebody freighters created a misperception about air realignment’s purpose, said Pat DiMento, vice president of flight operations and training, in a secretly recorded meeting with pilot evaluators several weeks ago that was shared with FreightWaves. “If we don’t capture some of that middle band, we will never get their [shipper’s] freight that is also in the priority range. Right now, we don’t offer much in that middle band to save money for these companies. So they are trying to capture that so that we can also grow what is our priority, international business.”', 'FedEx, UPS and DHL Express offer excess capacity on their airlines at bargain rates compared to for-hire freighter operators because the main parcel product covers the fixed cost base — much like passenger airlines enhance margins by selling available belly space to shippers. All-cargo airlines are challenged to compete with widebody passenger airlines, which often can offer lower rates because operating costs are allocated to the passenger business. The share of international cargo capacity on freighters has declined the past two years as travel picked up after the COVID crisis and passenger airlines reintroduced more flights.', 'But freight management companies take a risk shipping with FedEx and UPS because they are offloaded first if there isn’t enough space on a flight. The best time to utilize an integrated package carrier is the summer, when they aren’t as busy, according to logistics specialists.', 'The Orange network is already being organized. In February, FedEx plans to launch two new daytime flights from Liege, Belgium, to Memphis and Indianapolis. “We are also evaluating the right timing for additional flights from Liege to Oakland and Newark. In Europe, the Liege hub is a key part of the strategy, given its purpose-built capabilities for freight handling and optimal pallet build,” Brownlee said.', 'He described the changes to the priority parcel network as rightsizing, rather than downsizing, the airline. Some aircraft on low-volume lanes have been parked, but the company also plans to grow in other markets this year. FedEx Express, for example, intends to start a route by September serving El Salvador and Guatemala, utilizing a Boeing 757 freighter. Management also is working to launch service to Argentina, Chile and Ecuador in April with a Boeing 767 cargo jet, subject to necessary government approvals.', 'Finally, FedEx will use third-party carriers — the White network — as flex capacity and to backfill imbalanced trade routes. “This isn’t an approach that costs anyone jobs or puts at risk the future of FedEx flying. Rather, it gives us extra scalable capacity … which in turn helps us grow our market share in all sectors of the global air freight market,” Brownlee said.', 'A FedEx employee, who asked not to be identified because of concerns about possible job retaliation, agreed the color-coded strategy actually could be a positive development for pilots, who have seen their billable flight hours sharply reduced in the past year. By handling priority shipments separately from deferred freight, FedEx can go after a greater share of the less time sensitive heavy palletized airfreight and e-commerce markets in a profitable manner.', 'DiMento stressed in the meeting that FedEx is “not trying to drive product down to other carriers, we’re not trying to wet-lease [outsource] anything. All of that stuff is just crazy talk.”', 'But logistics experts question whether FedEx can be viable long term in the general cargo sector given its elevated cost structure, including pay scales for pilots that far exceed those of international freighter operators, and the relatively low margins.', '“To make a competitive product is difficult and it runs the risk of diluting your core international Express products,” said Derek Lossing, a former head of global freight procurement at Amazon who now runs Cirrus Global Advisors. “It’s not a great time to make a lot of money in air cargo because of the low rates. There’s not a lot of margin” because freight forwarders buy airport-to-airport transportation as a commodity in the wholesale market, and aren’t keen to pay a premium, he explained.', 'And rates, which have fallen back near 2019 levels excluding fuel surcharges, could go lower this year as more capacity enters the market. The supply of cargo space is about 7% to 13% greater year over year and 4% greater than pre-pandemic levels, primarily because of the strong return of passenger aircraft and their associated belly storage, according to the International Air Transport Association and others. More widebody passenger aircraft are expected to hit the market as China fully reopens to air travel this year.', 'Some Wall Street analysts believe FedEx hasn’t truly come to terms with the amount of structural cost reductions necessary to achieve decent profits. The DRIVE cost initiative is already losing steam, going from $1.4 billion in savings in the quarter ended May 31 to $600 million in the quarter ended Nov. 30. In Express, expense reduction went from $500 million to $200 million over the same six-month period. FedEx Express’ operating margin was an all-time low of about 2.2% in the prior quarter. Meanwhile, management guidance suggests the next two quarters could be the worst ever for Express profitability.', 'FedEx has 407 mainline aircraft in its fleet, while rival UPS operates about 290 aircraft, according to fact sheets from each company.', '“We applaud management for trying something new with the air network, but suspect this is lending back to the FedEx of old, focused on service improvements. While reallocating air capacity to improve transit times is admirable, the overarching and long-term problem at Express has been', 'and remains excess network capacity,” said Barclays transportation analyst Brandon Oglenski, in a research report. “While it may initially hurt, we think true margin improvement and finally earning returns in excess of the high levels of capital required to run Express would take a structural 20%-to-30% reduction in capacity from current operations, which just does not seem to be in the cards with current management plans.”', 'In the memo, Brownlee said FedEx has deferred taking down four MD-11 freighters in the second half of the fiscal year, ending May 31, because of incremental volume increases in the Asia, Middle East and Africa regions. Nonetheless, the retirement plan for the aging aircraft has not changed.

Calhoun', ""Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. While we report on our fourth quarter results today, my focus is on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 and the actions we are taking as a company that strengthen quality and earn the confidence of our customers, the confidence of our regulators and the flying public. Brian will cover the financials. I will keep my comments strictly to the issue at hand. I'll start upfront by apologizing again to Alaska Airlines, to their crew and to their passengers and more broadly to all of our customers who were affected by the 737 MAX 9 grounding. The NTSB's investigation into the accident is ongoing.I have an amazing amount of confidence in the work that they do. They bring experts to the investigation. And they take all the time that's necessary to draw accurate conclusions, and we intend to be there with them. As part of that NTSB process, I cannot comment on any specific root cause or speculate a root cause. As a participant in the process, I do believe the investigation will narrow quickly. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better. Our customers deserve better. I want to remind everybody what a great job the pilots and the crew at Alaska Airlines did in responding to a desperate moment. I also want to remind everybody what a terrific job the leadership at Alaska Airlines did, grounding the airplanes and ensuring safety.Alaska Airlines did exactly what companies like Boeing would hope that they do at a moment like that. And that is why the airline industry is as safe as it is. We caused the problem, and we understand that. Over these last few weeks, I've had tough conversations with our customers, with our regulators, congressional leaders and more. We understand why they are angry, and we will work to earn their confidence. There is no message, no slogan that will accomplish that. It's all about real, demonstrated action and absolute transparency every step of the way. So let's talk about those steps. Our team has worked diligently to help our customers restore their 737-9 airplanes to service. The FAA approved the detailed inspection protocol last Wednesday. And today, all 737-9 operators are safely returning their airplanes in service. More broadly, we are taking immediate and comprehensive actions to strengthen quality of Boeing and within our supply chain. We instituted additional quality controls and inspections at Boeing and at our supplier. We issued bulletins to suppliers to strengthen the focus on conformance and reducing the risks of quality escapes. We opened our factories to 737 operators for additional direct oversight. And we appointed an expert quality adviser to conduct a comprehensive and independent review of our commercial airplane quality management system, and they will remain with us for many years.Most importantly, last week, we paused 737 production for the day as more than 10,000 teammates across Renton, Seattle and Moses Lake stopped to focus on safety and quality and only safety and quality. This was a quality stand-down at a scale we have never done before, and we're going to keep doing them across our commercial factories. In addition to our internal actions, the FAA has announced new oversight of our 737 manufacturing. We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn. We respect their role as our regulator, and we will follow their direction in every step on production.Today, we're producing 737s at a rate of 38 per month. And we will remain at that rate until the FAA and Boeing is satisfied with our quality and manufacturing process. This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us, from our regulator or from third parties, will make us better. It's that simple.Over the last several years, we've taken close care not to push the system too fast. And we have never hesitated to slow down, to halt production or to stop deliveries to take the time we need to get things right. Nobody knows that better than our investors.As you know, we stopped delivering 787s for over a year to ensure that each conform to our exacting specifications prior to delivery. And on the 737 line, we have regularly slowed rate breaks to support the stability of the overall production system and to correct nonconformances when identified. But this accident makes it absolutely clear we have more work to do. I know that these moments that impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and our investors. But quality and safety must come above all else. And our customers and our investors know that and are in there with us.On that note, as you will see, we are not issuing financial outlook for 2024 today. Now is not the time for that. We won't predict timing. We won't get ahead of our regulator. We will go slow to go fast. And we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down if that's what's needed.We will simply focus on every next airplane and ensuring we meet all the standards that we have, all the standards that our regulator has and that our customers demand. As we go about that work, we remain confident in our recovery. Since day 1, we've been focused squarely on inculcating safety and quality to everything that we do and getting back to our legacy of having engineering excellence at the center of our business. That focus and commitment is unwavering. And we will continue to strengthen our processes and our execution every step of the way. Most importantly, we will be transparent every step of the way. And with our 170,000 employees in mind, I'd like to close with a message directly to our team. We have confidence in you, and we have confidence in Boeing. We have confidence in our airplanes. I know how seriously you take your work.Our men and women on the manufacturing floor and in our engineering offices know exactly what we must do. You know your work better than anyone else on the planet. Use your voice, speak up, focus on every next detail. We will seek out and act on your feedback. We're in a challenging moment. We will earn trust back through demonstrated action and a commitment to total transparency. I'm confident in you, I'm confident in our company and that together, we will do just that. Brian, over to you."", 'Brian J. West', ""Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's start off with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $22 billion. That's up 10% year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher commercial volume and favorable mix. The core loss per share was $0.47, better than last year primarily on improved commercial volume, better mix and lower abnormal costs. They were offset by lower defense margins and higher period expenses, including R&D, which we expected.Free cash flow was $3 billion in the quarter, in line with the prior year and up sequentially from the third quarter primarily due to improved commercial deliveries and strong order activity, which show favorable advanced payment timing, some of which was anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 611 net orders in the quarter with 411 737s, including an order with Akasa, 98 777Xs largely an Emirates order and 83 787s. We have over 5,600 airplanes in backlog valued at $441 billion. BCA delivered 157 airplanes in the quarter, and revenue was $10.5 billion. That's up 13% driven by higher widebody deliveries and favorable mix. Operating margin was just positive at 0.4%, driven by returning to normal 737 delivery levels in the quarter, improved mix as well as lower abnormal costs associated with getting to 5 per month on the 87 and resuming production on the 777X. Now I'll give more color on the key programs. On the 737, we delivered 110 airplanes in the quarter and 45 in December. The program also began FAA certification flight testing on the 737-10 in December.For the year, we delivered 396 airplanes, on the upper end of the revised guidance range we provided in October. Per the FAA announcement, we'll maintain production at 38 per month and work transparently with the FAA to complete all requirements for future increases. At the same time, we'll continue to prioritize the master schedule to avoid disruption in our supply chain.On the 737-9, we're actively supporting our customers' return to service activities. And as of today, the majority are back flying. In our factory, we have 10 -9s in production, all of which will undergo the FAA-proved inspection process prior to delivery. Spirit has also adopted this inspection routine in its factory. The quarter ended with about 200 MAX airplanes in inventory. It's important to think about this inventory in 3 buckets. First, there are 140 737-8s built prior to 2023. The vast majority are for customers in China and India. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we work towards shutting down the shadow factory. In the second bucket, there are around 25 airplanes produced in 2023 that are still in WIP, given the disruptions in the second half of last year. And we expect these to deliver in 2024. And lastly, there are approximately 35 -7s to -10s that we will deliver once those airplanes are certified, the timing of which will be determined by the FAA. Moving on to the 787. We delivered 23 airplanes in the quarter, including 11 in December. For the year, we delivered 73 airplanes, within the guidance range we originally outlined for 2023. The program successfully transitioned production to 5 per month in the quarter and still plan to steadily work our way to 10 per month in the '25, '26 time frame. We ended the quarter with approximately 60 airplanes in inventory, about 50 of which require rework, which continues to progress steadily. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory. We booked $77 million of abnormal costs in the quarter and have approximately $300 million left to go that will wind down by year-end, in line with our expectations.On the 777X, we resumed production in the quarter and continue to progress along the program timeline, which remains unchanged. During the quarter, the Emirates order for 90 777Xs, brought the program backlog to more than 400 airplanes and also extended the accounting quantity.We continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the certification process, including working to obtain approval from the FAA to begin certification flight testing. We booked $71 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, which is now fully behind us after resuming production, in line with our expectations.Moving to the next page, Boeing Defense and Space. BDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including the Lot 10 award from the U.S. Air Force for 15 KC-46A tankers. The backlog is now at $59 billion. Revenue was $6.7 billion, up 9% on the tanker award and improved volume. And BDS delivered 52 aircraft and 2 satellites in the quarter. Operating margin was minus 1.5% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from 3Q, but still we have more work to do.4Q results were impacted by cost true-ups on 3 fixed-price development programs totaling $139 million as well as unfavorable performance and mix on other programs. Our game plan to get BDS back to high single-digit margins by the '25, '26 time frame remains unchanged.Our core business remains solid, representing 60% of our revenue and performing in the mid- to high single-digit margin range. The demand for these products is very strong. And we need to execute, compete and grow these offerings. On the 25% of the portfolio primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs, operational performance stabilized as we exit the year. And as a result, the fourth quarter saw improved margin trends, although still negative. We still expect to return to the strong historical performance levels as we roll in our new contracts with tighter underwriting disciplines as we move into the '25, '26 time frame.Lastly, we have our fixed-price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of revenue. Despite the relatively modest cost (inaudible) in the quarter, we continue to focus on maturing these programs and retiring risks quarter in, quarter out. And we made some good progress in the fourth quarter.In addition to capturing the tanker award from the U.S. Air Force, the program delivered 9 aircraft in the fourth quarter, continuing to build positive momentum in spite of the supply-related disruptions to the factory that we faced earlier last year. And on the T-7A, the first Red Hawk arrived at Edwards Air Force Base in November, formally starting the Air Force development flight test campaign for the aircraft.Overall, the defense portfolio is poised to improve. The strong demand across the customer base, the products are performing in the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive execution and stability will return this business to performance levels that our investors recognize. Moving now to the next page, Boeing Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter. They received $6 billion in orders, and the backlog is now at $20 billion. Revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6% primarily on favorable commercial volume and mix. Operating margins were a very strong 17.4%, an expansion of 350 basis points versus last year as both our commercial and government businesses were delivering double-digit margins. In the quarter, BGS opened a parts distribution center in India and received a follow-on contract to provide sustainment for the C-17. Turning now to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $16 billion. On debt, the balance remained flat at $52.3 billion. And over the next few days, we'll pay down $4 billion of the $5 billion of maturities coming due this year from our available cash on hand. We continue to maintain access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. Our liquidity position remains strong. Our investment-grade credit rating continues to be a priority. And we're developing -- deploying capital in line with the projects we've shared previously: invest in the business and pay down debt. Turning to the next page, I'll cover our full year financials. Full year revenue was $77.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by improved commercial volume primarily on higher 787 deliveries. The core loss per share was $5.81, better than prior year primarily on improved commercial volume and mix as well as lower fixed-price development charges in defense. Free cash flow was $4.4 billion for the year, up versus prior year primarily on higher 787 deliveries and favorable receipt timing that was partially offset by higher expenditures as we increase production rates and invest in the business. While we're postponing issuing 2024 guidance today, given our current focus, we're committed to sharing timely and transparent updates moving forward. I would like to provide some additional context on our path forward.We always knew 2024 was going to be an important year in our recovery. Based on what we know today, we expect another steady year of free cash flow driven by the 737 production at 38 per month, ongoing execution of the 787 toward our long-term objectives, continued liquidation of our 737 and 787 inventory and continued focus to wind down both shadow factories.Our defense business will continue to improve as we mature fixed-price programs and transition recently challenged programs with better underwriting disciplines that we've already started to see. And BGS will continue to generate strong free cash flow.Longer term, we're focused on quality and stability, which will ultimately drive free cash flow. Nothing has changed on the demand front, and the backlog is strong and growing.Remember, our '25, '26 guidance was based on achieving stability. And we have to earn that by applying resources to fix our issues and demonstrate predictability one airplane at a time, side-by-side with our regulator.This team is up to the challenge, and we'll apply any and all resources to get back to deliveries that satisfy our customers and underwrite the long-term demand profile. We're still confident in the goals we laid out for '25, '26 although it may take longer in that window than originally anticipated, and we won't rush the system.With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for closing comments."", 'David L. Calhoun', ""Yes. Thanks, Brian. We're addressing you from Renton, home of 737 MAX family. We're living in the here and now, and we're working with all of our people. And I couldn't be more impressed with their commitment, dedication and the comprehensive nature around which they will look at this. Boeing will get better. I am confident in that. We will address everything that needs to be learned from the accident, and we'll move forward. So thanks. Happy to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Peter Arment.', 'Peter J. Arment', ""Yes. Dave, thanks for the initial opening color on the MAX situation and the steps being taken. So I guess just to follow on that, Dave, I wanted to ask you about where you assess you are in kind of the recovery of the MAX program when we think about what has been a successful transition to rate 38 and some of the progress in stabilizing the supply chain. And you've commenced deliveries to China. And I know we're not talking about '25, '26 targets, but directionally. There's been a lot of improvement since last fall and since your Investor Day when you laid out this long-term outlook."", 'David L. Calhoun', ""Yes, Peter. I appreciate that. By the way, one stat, which I was just handed, which I track all the time is the number of our -9s that have been returned into service. We're at 129, and that is progressing at a very quick rate based on the inspection protocols that are FAA and we all agreed with. I am very proud of the progress that we've made, and I feel great about it, of course, with one exception, and it's too big an exception, which is the escape. I also know that as the NTSB investigation narrows and concludes, and I do believe that will happen in relatively short order, all the learning that can be extracted from it and all the learning that can be extracted from all those inspections of all those airplanes flying day in and day out, that will inform us on what improvements we can make on our quality systems. First and foremost, we will run the door plug literally from the second a door is received at Wichita through their lines, all 12 positions, through our 11 positions here. Inspections will be added at every turn. It is on lockdown, and we've had help from our FAA. We've had help from our customers, et cetera. So that's sort of step 2. The next one is how do you take all of that learning and apply it through all the supply chain lines. And we have some medium- and long-term efforts just beginning to make sure that we do that. My confidence comes from quality systems always can get better. And when you have a moment like this, you take everything. You literally look at everything, and we're all keenly aware of everything.So we're going to run that play as hard as we can, and we're going to take the time to do it and the FAA -- I'm sort of glad they called out a pause because that's a good excuse to just take our time, do it right, and I wish I had called that out in the first day, but maybe I would have. We've been good at taking pauses. I've probably taken more pauses in the last 3 years, and I'll apologize to all our investors now, than have been taken in 10 years before it. But this is what we do, and it's how we get better. And I also say, Peter, as you know, one of the nagging issues that we've been facing have been shortages here and there, where we have to pause our line. Buffer inventory is not quite as robust as we'd like them to be based on supply chain weaknesses. We will run our master schedule in accordance with the plans that preceded this. And each and every part we receive and all the buffer inventories that we get will stabilize production here on out, less traveled work in our line, all things good come from that.So I feel really good about it. And I also have confidence in our airplanes that will be certified. I like the respect that the FAA and Boeing are showing one another. Again, maybe too long a diatribe, but there are lots of sound reasons for why I'm feeling good. And in some ways, this moment will accelerate recovery, not delay it."", 'Peter J. Arment', 'And just initial progress on China?', 'David L. Calhoun', ""Yes. So Peter, as we've talked many, many, many times, we have stood by our customers in China day in, day out. They have been flying MAXs now for the better part of the year. They are performing extremely well. And we'd always hoped and expected they would begin to take deliveries. And I think everybody has noticed that those deliveries have started. So we are just going to stay diligent, stay with each and every one of them and make sure our Chinese customers get what they've ordered and paid for."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""Maybe if you could update us on how you're thinking about the MAX 10 and the MAX 7 certification timing, just given MAX 7 exemption being withdrawn. What does it mean for the 10? And how does that phase in as you think about ramping production to 50 a month and the profit profile of the MAX side if there's no MAX 7 or 10?"", 'David L. Calhoun', ""Sheila, thanks for that question. I'm going to just give a little bit of a moment on why we made that decision on the time-limited exemption. I'll let Brian help quantify it. I visited Capitol Hill for a lot of reasons. My biggest one is to own the problem, be transparent and convey that to all of our workforce so that they know we're willing to do that. And then we can all be honest, clear with each other every step of the way in this process. And so I'm glad I made the visit. I was not expecting when I met with Senator Duckworth, the conversation that we had. You know she's a pilot and a decorated pilot. She listened to everything I had to say. We didn't have a debate about the safety of the 7. And the 7 in its certification work was moving along at a pretty steady pace.She had a way different argument for me, and it was right. She said, you want to introduce this new airplane, a derivative, yes, but a new airplane. And 9 months from now, you'll have an engineered solution to it, to this issue. And why is that the right call? And in my view, it was a sound, principled position to take. I went home for the weekend. I talked to our customer, and you know who that is, unbelievably constructive, and this is the right thing to do for aviation. So that is really how it happened, and it was that simple. But the passion and the argument that Senator Duckworth presented to me, I'm so glad I heard. Anyway, that's what happened. The 7 will have to move until we get that engineered fix in place. And then I'll let Brian sort of quantify the, okay, now what."", 'Brian J. West', ""Yes. And on the 7, the work at hand, we will design engineering solution. We're applying the resources. Our view that, that could be within a year. But on the 7, remember, while it's a very, very important customer, the number of deliveries you're talking about is relatively small. As I mentioned, we've got 35 of -7 and -10s in inventory at the end of the quarter. There are a handful of 10s. They're mostly 7. So we'll sort that out as the process works in that airplane before the FAA gets certified. On your question on the -10, I prefer not to get into what ifs. It is a great airplane. Customers love it, and there's great demand for it, and it will get certified at some point when the FAA decides."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""Brian, you alluded to 2024 being another -- I think the words were steady year of free cash flow. I think in sort of follow-on descriptions, you gave a lot of uppers to what's going to happen year-on-year. So is steady meaning growth in free cash flow and/or can you give some of the offsets to the uppers?"", 'Brian J. West', ""Yes. Thanks, Myles. So I did describe some of the key ones. Obviously, BCA volume up, BDS less of a drag, BGS steady. There's a big investment in there that I probably should have called out now that you're asking is the 777X investment. That's important, and that's big. And also, we got a plan for making sure that we stay laser like our supply based on the master schedule. We don't want them to take their foot off what they're doing. And if that means we got to hold more inventory, so be it.It's important because at this moment, it will allow us to have any of our suppliers that might have been at the line (inaudible) than short of the line, they get a chance to catch up. So all of that in the mix are levers that we got to deal with as we move into the year. And in terms of what steady means, our belief we stand here today, the bottom end will look a lot like it did last year and maybe a little bit of growth. And once we know more, we'll put more specificity around it, and we'll give normal guidance when adequate, when appropriate."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.', 'Seth Michael Seifman', 'Brian, you talked a couple of times about the shadow factories and the path towards winding them down over the next year and change. Is there any way to quantify how you think about what the cost of the shadow factories was in 2023 or what you expect it to be in 2024?', 'Brian J. West', ""Yes. So thanks. I would -- the impact you're not going to see in 2024, just because we still have to move that work through the system. But as we exit, it will largely -- behind us. As we think about our expectations on BCA profitability over time, we've always talked to it getting back to normal. A lot of that productivity will be not only what volume might look like. I can't say a lot about that now. But also, we don't have this resource with the shadow factories. So we won't quantify it specifically, but it is an important component as we think about going from what our profitability has looked like at BCA historically and where we think we can get to."", 'David L. Calhoun', ""Maybe I'll just add and refresh everybody's memory because we've talked about it a couple of times. In our shadow factories, we put more hours into those airplanes than we do to produce it in the first place. So anyway, that's a metric I know everybody understands."", 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""Great. And maybe if I could sneak in one more to -- the advances, it was a nice tailwind in '23. How do you think about that in '24?"", 'Brian J. West', ""Right now, we plan for, obviously, not to be quite what it was in 2023. That's factored into my comments. The good news is, is that we still have a pretty robust demand environment and our commercial teams are working hard to chase every next order. So we're not counting on a big one, but we know that our teams can go win campaigns."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Jason Gursky from Citi.', 'Jason Michael Gursky', ""Brian, just maybe a quick clarification or maybe, Dave, and then a question on defense. The clarification on the rate 38 a month, you guys still firing some planes so that the number that you're actually producing is a little bit less than that? Just kind of curious what rate 38 means. And then on defense, Brian, you've historically broken things down into that 60, 25, 15 bucket. You talked a little bit about the 25% bucket and the 15% bucket in your remarks. So I was wondering if you can just comment on the 60%, the remaining part of the portfolio and how that's performing and where maybe margins are in that slug of business at this point?"", 'Brian J. West', ""Sure. I'll take the first one. Yes, we've cycled to 38 per month. We said that. Keep in mind, it always takes time for that to equate it to deliveries, but we're not firing blanks. On your question on the 60% of the portfolio on BDS, look, they've consistently quarter in, quarter out has still been able to deliver some very good performance on some products that the customers need. And you know the laundry list that we talked about, things like Apache and all that sort of stuff, missiles and weapons, things that are needed right now in this environment that we live in. And they're performing well. And they're in that mid- to high single-digit margin rate. And when we step back, if we think about going from where BDS is with margins, 2 things have to happen. That 25% that's wrapped around fighters and satellites, that has to get better. We expect it to get better and look a lot like it used to. So then you've got 85% of your portfolio clicking at stable, consistent mid- to high single-digit rates. And we know we can get there. And then you've got this 15% of the portfolio on fixed-price development programs that we expect to be less of a drag as we retire risk over time. And we expect that to play out."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein.', 'Douglas Stuart Harned', ""I want to go back to the MAX 7 and the MAX 10 certification. And the question I have is when you look forward and given there is uncertainty on the timing of the certification of each one of those, and you look at both the mix and your customer demand. And certainly, you've had more demand than you can respond to, given supply chain issues. First, let's say that mix changes because of the timing of certification on those 2 variants. Are you still -- do you still see your line as full because it could be moved around between -7s, 8s, 9s, 10s? And then second, what kind of operational challenges, if any, do you have when you have to have some flexibility about what variant you're producing?"", 'David L. Calhoun', ""Doug, I'll just start by saying I think it's manageable. We will have this -- if there's a delay in any way, we're not going to know at the last second. We're going to know with a considerable time frame in my view. And by the way, right now, the status on the 7 and the 10 was progressing reasonably well. I don't believe the FAA has taken anybody off the course, and we haven't taken anybody off the course. And so they are making real progress.And I think we were almost close to the finish line had we not pulled the time-limited exemption. So I don't -- again, I'm never going to suggest a date or anything like that for the FAA. But they're working diligently on it, and they know how to separate these 2 -- these -- the issue we're wrestling within our factory from the [cert] efforts. And I believe we're going to have plenty of time, and we'll be able to manage our product mix reasonably well. There won't be anything dramatic by way of change. If there are some subtle change from quarter-to-quarter, first or second, you'll know it pretty early, and so will we. And I think it's quite manageable."", 'Douglas Stuart Harned', 'So is it fair to say that the supply chain ramp is probably still the governing constraint on your production ramp, not things like mix here?', 'David L. Calhoun', ""Yes. Although I will say, if this pause goes on for a little while, I like -- I don't want to pause my customers. But the pause is going to be helpful for us in so many ways in the sense that, that supply chain, they're going to keep running according to that master schedule. It's good for us if some buffers get developed and some of the more stressed suppliers get ahead of the game. So there is important progress that will get made despite this momentary pause."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.', 'Ronald Jay Epstein', ""If I may, I got a 2-part question if that's okay. The first one, if you guys could walk through 787 a little bit. You mentioned the rate -- what's going on in that line, that sort of thing. We get questions about that. And then I'll come back with the second part in a second."", 'Brian J. West', ""Yes. So on the 787, there's nothing new on the 87. Team is doing a very nice job. We'll produce at the 5 per month rate like we described. We expect to steadily increase those rates over time and liquidate a lot of inventory, a lot of inventory. And we'll give more dimensions around the specifics in line with normal guidance, but the program is doing just fine. And the backlog is big."", 'Ronald Jay Epstein', ""Yes, that's been doing great. And then maybe the second question, this one is a little more difficult. The -- I'm still trying to get my head around how we got here. Meaning if you go back to the beginning of the MAX issue, wasn't the 737 line like the most scrutinized production line in the world? So what happened to get to where we got today? I understand that revamping the quality system and all that is all great news. It's a positive move forward. But why did that have to happen now? And I just don't understand that."", 'David L. Calhoun', ""Well, Ron, it's a -- it should never happen. So the question about now is not so relevant. It should never and can never happen. I am incredibly proud of the work that our people do on the 37 line. I think it has steadily progressed. Quality numbers have gotten better.But when you have an escape and then when everybody concludes exactly what happened in that escape, that lights another fire. So you take another step forward with respect to all things quality. And you make certain that whatever it was that created that opportunity for failure in the sky or in flight can never happen again. And that has already happened, and then we'll learn from everything. So yes, I think I understand your underlying context for the question, but I probably take exception to that premise."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.', 'Cai von Rumohr', ""Yes. So now that you've waived the exemption on the engine anti-icing and you're redesign -- you're designing the new system, you said it would take about a year. Have you accelerated that at all? And could you accelerate it more because my assumption is that is going to be the long pole in the tent in terms of when you -- when the FAA can certify the MAX 7 and 10."", 'David L. Calhoun', ""I think that is an accurate statement that you just made. Given the fact that we made this decision just a couple of days ago, needless to say, we will throw more engineers at it. We're going to put more work into it and can accelerate it. And the 9 months that I discussed with Senator Duckworth was based on my understanding of that project before I made this decision. So the answer is yes, we'll step up resources. We'll step up whatever testing is required. We will do everything we can to inform the FAA about that particular part of that program. So -- and that's where we stand today. And you are correct. That is the pole in the tent all of us should be watching."", 'Cai von Rumohr', ""Terrific. And then another quick one. With the supply chain running at the master schedule but you're delivering not quite as many, should we think about a fairly large build in the inventory account here in the next couple of quarters until you get beyond that?"", 'Brian J. West', ""Yes. There's 2 things, Cai, that are going to be things we have to deal with in cash flow. One is going to be the 777X investment I discussed as well as what you just described. And that's contemplated in my description of what we thought the bottom look like. And then we just got to go run the play and work through what's in front of us. But more work ahead, and we'll describe it more specifically as we move through the year."", 'Matt Welch', 'Louis, we have time for one more question.', 'Operator', 'And that question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.', 'Noah Poponak', ""Might go over one if I'm last. But Brian, recognizing that there's some limitation here in how you can discuss it, but maybe just trying to talk out MAX units this year with assumptions of not breaking to higher rates. You made it a point to say you're at 38. I know that rate final assembly, where the entire supply chain is, is always a different number. But if I just simply said 31 for 6 months and 38 for 6 months, that's in the low 400s and then you unwind 5 to 10 of inventory a month. I can kind of get somewhere near 500 or just decent growth from 2023. Is that just a reasonable starting point as we wait to learn more from the FAA?"", 'Brian J. West', ""No, I completely understand the question. Those are the inputs I described. But out of respect for the process that we need to go through the FAA, I just got to steer away from specificity. It's just not the right time.We've got work in front of us. And I promise when appropriate, we are going to be more specific. But anyway, that's -- it's probably going to be on the specificity of those numbers, wait and see. It's just not appropriate."", 'Noah Poponak', 'Yes. Fair enough. Fair enough. Are you willing and able to speak to just updating what the cap is these days on the monthly inventory unwind and how China plays into that?', 'Brian J. West', ""I don't know we think about a cap. We've got the shadow factories that have been working for quite a while. And they know the routines, and they've been pretty steadily on both 37 and the 87, consistently meeting month in, month out liquidation targets and expectations for customers. So I don't think there's any kind of cap. We're just focused on we know exactly the [piles] inventory. It's 140 on the 37 that I described. It's 50 on the 87 that have to get the rework. And we're just going to move through this year with real focus in order to be in a position where we start shutting these shadow factories down. And then we're just going to run that play as hard as we can."", 'Noah Poponak', ""Okay. And is China officially fully 100% taking deliveries? We see it in the press. We see the reading of the tail number of websites. But can you just declare that, that's just fully officially on at this point?"", 'David L. Calhoun', 'One at a time, and yes.', 'Noah Poponak', ""Okay. And then, Brian, just one more, defense. The margin is still not where you want it but better sequentially. Any framework you can provide around how that progresses through '24? And what was the final defense cash burn in the '23 cash so we can think about where -- what to work off of as we go into '24."", 'Brian J. West', ""Yes. So the cash burn, we put out some numbers a year ago, and we thought the operating cash flows by division. BDS, the worst case and for them in that range they were much worse than that. And it's all what we described last year, and we expect it to be better this year. And that's behind us. But yes, they did a lot worse, obviously, offset by BGS and BCA doing better. But it was worse.And then the first part of your question on margins, we expect margin trajectories to get better over time, particularly as we focus on this 25% of the portfolio that is very specific, and there's a lot of actions or activity around it. But we will get better.They will eventually get to the point where we're putting positives on the board. What I'm most interested is the team that's got to execute over the next -- between now and 2025, '26 in order to get these margins back in the high single-digit range. And I will remind you that that's how we describe our defense margins. You really got to put 2 points on top of that, which is what we account for in our Global Services division for the defense side. So it's really more like a double-digit defense external view that we are aiming to get towards because we think that's a pretty decent business. Thanks, everyone."", 'David L. Calhoun', 'Thanks, everybody.', 'Operator', ""That completes the Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.""]"

The National Safety Transportation Board, which is investigating, is expected to release its preliminary findings soon.', 'That’s the Boeing of today and the last five years. But it wasn’t always that way.', 'It wasn’t that long ago that Boeing’s reputation was that of a staid industrial giant, known for building the safest, most advanced planes in the sky. It helped introduce the world to commercial jet travel.', 'Pilots and others in the industry, as well as members of the flying public, summed up their confidence in the company with the expression, “If it’s not Boeing, I’m not going.” The company still sells\xa0coffee cups\xa0and\xa0t-shirts\xa0with that slogan.', 'So how in the world did the company whose brand was once synonymous with safety become mired in reputational disaster – to the point where at least one travel site has a feature that allows passengers to avoid Boeing 737 Max planes altogether.', 'Experts and critics say that Boeing’s woes have been years in the making, some pointing to the result of a shift in corporate culture that started at the top and put profits ahead of the safety and engineering prowess for which it was once praised, placing not only its future, but the passengers on its planes, at grave risk.', 'While Boeing denies there has been such a shift away from safety and excellence, what is indisputable is that its engineering and manufacturing problems have contributed to a series of shocking incidents, two of which resulted in the deaths more than 300 people combined. Boeing simultaneously became a financial basket case, reporting cumulative net losses of more than $26 billion, and counting, over the last five years, with no end to the red ink in sight.', 'Boeing executives insist that quality and safety are still a top priority for the company, and the problems of recent years have only increased its focus on quality and safety. Asked for comment on the claim that it now puts profits ahead of quality and safety, the company pointed to a recent statement by CEO Dave Calhoun.', '“Over the last several years, we’ve added rigor around our quality processes, hired tens of thousands of engineers and mechanics, advanced key investments in our future, transformed our functions and gradually increased our production rates,” he told investors in October. “Most importantly, we’ve worked hard to instill a culture of speaking up and transparently bringing forward any issue, no matter the size, so we can get things right for the future.”', 'A week after Calhoun made the remark, the company delivered a 737 Max 9 to Alaska Air, the fourth it had built for the carrier that month. Code letters N704AL, the jet’s door plug blew out while the plane was mid-air, less than 10 weeks after it was delivered, just minutes into the January 5 flight.', 'The company also pointed to what it called a “quality stand down,” on Thursday for its 737 factory teams in Renton, Washington in which it halted production to focus on quality issues. Boeing announced the move in the wake of a recently expanded federal probe into the company’s manufacturing practices following the Alaska Air incident and plans for Congressional hearings into its practices.', 'The first 737 Max 9 planes that were grounded after that incident returned to service on Friday, and most are expected to be back in the air by the end of this week.', '“Our long-term focus is on improving our quality so that we can regain the confidence of our customers, our regulator and the flying public. Frankly, we have disappointed and let them down,” said a statement by Stan Deal, the head of Boeing’s commercial airplane unit, in a statement to employees following that return to service. “Over the last century, the people of Boeing have faced and overcome significant challenges. This is one of those times. We have to be better. We have to deliver perfect airplanes each and every time.”', 'But critics say this crisis is unlike any earlier problems at the company, arguing that despite Boeing’s assurances, they believe there has been a cultural change within the company in the last 25 years that has put profits over safety and quality.', '“Leadership is more concerned with\xa0getting the planes out the door than quality,” Ed Pierson, a former Boeing executive who is now the executive director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a public interest group, told CNN last week. He said planes are still being produced today with flaws not being caught.', 'The spark for the conflagration that has recently consumed Boeing might date back decades.', 'After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the huge American defense contractors began to consolidate. Fearful of their own survival without a communist enemy stalking NATO’s borders\xa0they\xa0began to merge with one another. In the decade after the end of the Cold War, 51 major American defense and aerospace contractors\xa0became just five huge companies.', 'And one of the five left standing was Boeing, newly merged in 1997 with competitor McDonell Douglas.', 'Critics said that before the merger, Boeing had a reputation as a company run by people with engineering backgrounds who cared about quality and safety first. But those critics say the merger put the company in the hands of executives with a finance background, who put profits as their top goal.', '“Boeing had a reputation before the merger of a company where engineers were high church,” Ron Epstein, an\xa0aerospace analyst at Bank of America, told CNN. It resulted in Boeing not being as profitable as some comparable manufacturers, he said.', 'But after the merger he said, “everything had to be cost-justified.”', 'On paper, Boeing was the company that bought McDonnell Douglas. But many of the leadership ranks became filled with McDonnell Douglas veterans, not Boeing executives.', 'Many of them had financial backgrounds, not the engineering backgrounds of those who had run Boeing in the past. Or they came from outside of the company, such as from General Electric, where cost-cutting and improved efficiency was a near religion.', 'One of those was Jim McNerney, who became Boeing CEO in 2005, after a career that started at consumer products maker Procter & Gamble, included time at management consultant McKinsey & Co., and was followed by years at GE. He was CEO of 3M before being tapped to run Boeing, without any engineering and limited aerospace experience.', 'Under this leadership the company moved away, figuratively and literally, from its Pacific Northwest roots, where top executives had been intimately familiar with the massive assembly lines there where commercial jets were built, and any problems that might be developing there.', 'In 2001 it moved its headquarters to Chicago. And in the midst of various crises in recent years, it moved its headquarters again in 2022,\xa0not back to Seattle, but to a\xa0suburb of Washington, DC,\xa0near the Pentagon, Capitol Hill, and its various regulators, like the FAA. Ironically the move to Washington came the same week Airbus\xa0revealed that it was increasing production of commercial jets at its factory in\xa0Mobile, Alabama, only seeming to drive home the point to critics that Boeing was moving in the wrong direction.', '“One company is saying ‘We’re going to build lots of jets.’ The other is saying ‘We’re going to lobby the Pentagon and Congress for defense dollars.’ It’s a big contrast,” said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a leading aerospace analyst.', 'Boeing became more dependent on suppliers to build more and more of its planes, seeking to limit its role to joining together the parts. And it spun-off some of the operations it had depended upon previously. Supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselages for Boeing’s planes, including the 737 Max, was created in 2005 after Boeing sold its Wichita division and Oklahoma operations raising $900 million in cash by doing so.', 'And in 2009, about a year after weathering a 58-day strike at its unionized plants in Washington state, the company announced plans for a non-union plant in right-to-work South Carolina to assemble its new, most advanced jet, the 787 Dreamliner, giving it a factory with lower pay that wasn’t at risk of going on strike in the future.', 'Calhoun, Boeing’s current CEO, took over in January 2020, nine months into the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes. He also has no engineering background, having served as senior managing director and head of portfolio operations at investing firm The Blackstone Group, CEO of Nielsen and spending 26 years at GE.', 'Just over a year and a half later, after the pandemic reduced demand for the long-range Dreamliner due to the drop in international travel, Calhoun and Boeing decided it needed to\xa0preserve cash\xa0and could no longer justify two 787 plants. It had a choice between consolidating production to a veteran plant in Washington state staffed by unionized employees and a non-union South Carolina plant. It decided to close the unionized line in Washington and keep the South Carolina plant.', 'But it soon had quality problems with the 787 Dreamliners being produced there, leading to two costly halts in deliveries, one lasting over a year.', 'Although Boeing says it values its worldwide staff, it made deep staff cuts during the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, offering buyouts to more senior workers. The loss of expertise has proven devastating, Bank of America’s Epstein said.', '“A key variable is your workforce,” he said. “You want it to be as experienced as possible. When it’s all said and done, how much do you really save closing the unionized plant?”', 'Aviation safety advocate Pierson served as a senior manager at Boeing’s 737 factory after a career in the military. He left the company in 2018, just months before the first fatal crash. He told CNN his frustration with top management attitudes on quality led him to quit.', 'In 2019 he testified to Congress that there was evidence that the 737 Max was having production quality issues, including planes being delivered to airlines that had faulty hardware or other system malfunctions, problems that involved more than a dozen safety issues, some of which he described as serious. He recounted that he had recommended a halt in production of the 737 Max to deal with quality issues in the months ahead of the first crash. He said the boss to whom he had made the recommendation told him, “We can’t do that, I can’t do that.”', '“I pushed back, explaining that I had seen operations in the military shut down over less substantial safety issues, and those organizations had national security responsibilities,” he testified. He said his supervisor responded tersely, “The military isn’t a profit-making organization.”', 'Other experts agree with Pierson that despite its claims of being concerned with safety and quality, Boeing’s actions suggest otherwise.', '“You’re looking at a management team whose idea of acknowledging the problem is to readjust the cash flow numbers for next year,” said Aboulafia in an interview with CNN.', 'And then disaster struck.', 'The first fatal\xa0crash of a 737 Max\xa0occurred\xa0in Indonesia in October 2018, the\xa0second in Ethiopia in March 2019, killing a total of 346 people. It led to a 20-month grounding of all 737 Max jets. In addition to the horrifying loss of life, it cost the company more than $21 billion, making it one of the costliest corporate disasters on record, as well as one of the most deadly.', 'After the first crash, Boeing successfully pushed to keep the planes in the air. Even after the second crash, as airline regulators around the world\xa0grounded the jet, Boeing pushed the FAA to hold off on its own grounding order, saying that it had “full confidence in the safety\xa0of the 737 Max” and that “based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance” to airlines.', 'When the FAA gave in to\xa0global and public pressure to announce its\xa0own grounding, Boeing said it accepted the move out of an “abundance of caution.”', 'Eventually it was a design flaw in the Max that was blamed for the two fatal crashes, as a feature meant to stop the planes from climbing too fast and stalling instead forced the nose of the planes downward.', 'But critics of Boeing say the problem wasn’t just the flawed design of the jet that led to the deaths, it was the decisions that Boeing made to not quickly acknowledge the problem with design after the first crash, and have a grounding take place at that time, which could have prevented the second crash.', '“In the light most favorable to Boeing, the first crash was an accident, the second crash is a crime,” said Robert Clifford, the attorney suing Boeing on behalf of families of the victims of the second crash, the one in Ethiopia, in an interview with CNN. He said if the plane had been grounded immediately, Boeing might have ended up fixing the problem much faster, and with less expense, as well as preventing the second crash.', '“They gambled with people’s lives and the people lost,” he said.', 'In 2021 Boeing admitted to liability in the two crashes, agreeing to pay compensatory damages, which allowed the company to avoid the possibility of having to pay far more in punitive damages.', '“Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss,” the company said in a statement at that time. “By accepting responsibility, Boeing’s agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.”', 'It has also agreed to pay a $2.5 billion fine to settle charges it defrauded\xa0the FAA when it first won approval of the flawed 737 Max.', '“I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do — a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations,” Calhoun said at that time.', 'But that agreement was criticized by the families of victims of the Ethiopian air crash as well as members of Congress as being far too lenient. About 70% of the $2.5 billion fine it agreed to pay was money it had already agreed to pay as compensation to its airline customers.', 'Pierson said the probe that followed the second crash revealed\xa0Boeing executives\xa0were more concerned with continued production than finding the cause of the crash and fixing it.', '“They absolutely prioritized the delivery of planes over the investigation,” he said.', 'Pierson said the design flaw, as problematic as it was, was not the total problem that led to the crash. He said the quality of the work that would produce various malfunctions while the planes were in flight was just as significant as the design flaw.', 'He points to a report from the Ethiopian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau that looked at both fatal crashes and found that “These accidents were triggered by production quality defects that… presented as intermittent system malfunctions.”', 'Without the build quality issues causing malfunctions, the design flaw feature of the plane that forced the nose of the plane down would not have turned on, and the flights would not have crashed, according to the Ethiopian report.', 'But that finding got little attention as the US National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA focused on design flaws rather than the build\xa0quality issues, Pierson said.', 'Eventually the probe provided an ugly look at the\xa0decision-making process\xa0at Boeing. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”', 'Boeing’s release of the documents included an apology to the FAA, Congress, airlines, and the public.', 'An ironic part of Boeing’s focus on profits is that it has resulted in a company that is\xa0in the worst financial shape in its more than 100-year history, with five years of deep losses already,\xa0and more expected losses ahead.', 'As recently as 2018 Boeing was riding high, reporting revenue of more than $100 billion for the first time in its history and projecting more growth to come. It had just started deliveries of the 737 Max the year before. The short-term focus on profits was, indeed, producing profits. At least for a little while.', 'Its rival Airbus was the one struggling, on the verge of abandoning its $25 billion mistake, the A380 superjumbo jet that had turned out to be a white elephant with little demand from airlines or passengers. Despite that, the two companies were neck-and-neck in orders and deliveries.', 'But in less than a decade, all that has changed.', 'Airbus delivered 735 commercial jets last year. Boeing only 528. Net orders and the backlog of jets each is waiting to build show a larger imbalance. And while Airbus is forecast to report adjusted net income of 4.3 billion euros, or $4.7 billion profit, for 2023 when it reports results, Boeing just reported an operating loss of $3.2 billion for the year.', 'Aboulafia said the short-sighted push for profits has put the company at\xa0a severe competitive disadvantage to Airbus, and that Calhoun and other top managers at Boeing, as well as its board, need to go if the company is to have a chance to turn things around.', 'Despite the losses and severely weakened market position of Boeing, there is little chance it could go out of business.', 'The airlines around the world that have already bought Boeing planes basically need to keep using those models, whatever the problems.', 'Commercial pilots are certified on specific models\xa0and are not able to easily move\xa0from single-aisle to widebody versions of Boeing jets, let alone between a Boeing and an Airbus jet. And having different models means the airlines need to have a large, expensive supply of spare parts on hand to keep their planes in the air.', 'And any Boeing customer who canceled their orders today would have to get in line behind a backlog of more than 8,600 jets that Airbus has already agreed to build for its existing customers.', '“It’s a very weird industry. It has high barriers to entry and only two players. You can get away with nonsense like this,” said Aboulafia.', 'Pierson said incident reports on planes that Boeing continues to build, while not nearly as dramatic as the Alaska Air incident, suggest the\xa0pressure to put profits over quality remains, despite Boeing’s claims.', '“The company has gutted quality control so they can produce more airplanes,” he said. “The employees are completely overwhelmed. Everybody is focused on the Max 9, and rightfully so. That incident should never have happened. But there are issues on other planes. It has become a recipe for disaster.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.”', 'Boeing did not give the financial guidance that it normally provides to investors, nor say when it might be able to provide two new versions of the 737 Max that it has promised to airlines, but which have yet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.', '“While we often use this time of year to share or update our financial and operational objectives, now is not the time for that,” Calhoun said in comments to Boeing employees that were published by the company.', 'The January 5 incident in which a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight has put the company on the defensive once again. Fortunately, no one died, as the crew was able to make an emergency landing within minutes of the hole opening, but the brief flight terrified passengers who had cell phones and clothing ripped outside the plane. It led to a three-week grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 9 model as inspections discovered problems with the installation of other door plugs.', '“I’ve had tough and direct conversations with our customers, regulators and lawmakers,” he added. “They are disappointed, and we have much to prove to earn our stakeholders’ confidence.”', 'Calhoun’s statements came as the manufacturer posted another loss for 2023, while failing to provide a 2024 financial outlook that would have included expectations of approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for two new versions of the jet, the longer 737 Max 10 and the shorter 737 Max 7.', 'In the wake of the door plug incident, the FAA has said it will not allow the company to move ahead with planned increases in production of existing models. And two major customers, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, said last week they are pushing back plans indefinitely for deliveries they had been counting on for both models.', '“Our people on the factory floor know what we must do to improve better than anyone,” Calhoun said. “We will go slow, we will not rush the system and we will take our time to do it right.”', '“Increased scrutiny — whether from ourselves, from our regulator, or from others — will make us better,” he added.', 'In an interview Wednesday on CNBC, Calhoun said he’s not going to predict what the National Transportation Safety Board, which is conducting an investigation of the incident, will find as the cause. But he said that “I am convinced we have this [door] plug completely under control.”', 'The 737 Max 9 also got a vote of confidence Wednesday from Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB.', '“I would have no problem getting on a Max 9 tomorrow and flying,” Homendy told CNN in an interview. “Here’s what I will say about aviation safety overall. It is safe, but there are issues.”', 'She said the NTSB is in the “final stages” of preparing a preliminary report on the Alaska Air incident.', '“We want to make sure it’s right,” Homendy said about the agency’s preliminary findings. “This is a somewhat complex issue with a lot of parts.”', 'In his appearance on CNBC, Calhoun also defended the company’s decision not to give updated financial guidance. The company did say it is now producing 38 737 Max jets a month, but that is fewer than it needs to once again make a profit on its best-selling plane. The FAA’s limit on increased production of the Max in the wake of the Alaska Air incident will delay Boeing’s ability to return to profitability.', '“Our full attention, our full focus as a company is to make certain we never have a safety [incident] again, to learn everything we can from the accident, learn everything we can from the FAA’s audit, learn everything we can from… the ideas given to us by our own people,” he said.', 'Asked if Boeing has lost the confidence of its airline customers, he said that so far the customers are telling the company they are sticking with Boeing.', '“Was this a shot at them? Absolutely. As I said, these moments shake all of us to the bone – Boeing, our people, our customers, everybody,” he said. “Our job is to restore confidence at every level. They want Boeing to win. They want us to succeed.”', 'In what passes for good news for the troubled company, Boeing reported an adjusted loss of 47 cents a share, or about $285 million, in the fourth quarter, much better than the $1.75 a share loss a year earlier and the 78 cents a share loss estimates from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.', 'The company has not only reported losses in all but one quarter since late 2019, it has almost always reported a bigger loss than forecasts.', 'Shares of Boeing, which have lost nearly 20% of their value since the Alaska Air incident, were narrowly higher in premarket trading Wednesday on Calhoun’s comments and the quarterly report.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. While we report on our fourth quarter results today, my focus is on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 and the actions we are taking as a company to strengthen quality and earn the confidence of our customers, the confidence of our regulators, and the flying public. Brian will cover the financials.', ""I will keep my comments strictly to the issue at hand. I'll start upfront by apologizing again to Alaska Airlines, to their crew, and to their passengers, and more broadly, to all of our customers who are affected by the 737 MAX 9 grounding. The NTSB's investigation into the accident is ongoing. I have an amazing amount of confidence in the work that they do."", ""They bring experts to the investigation, and they take all the time that's necessary to draw accurate conclusions, and we intend to be there with them. As part of that NTSB process, I cannot comment on any specific root cause or speculate a root cause. As a participant in the process, I do believe the investigation will narrow quickly. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened."", 'Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better. Our customers deserve better. I want to remind everybody what a great job the pilots and the crew at Alaska Airlines did in responding to a desperate moment.', ""I also want to remind everybody what a terrific job the leadership at Alaska Airlines did, grounding the airplane and ensuring safety. Alaska Airlines did exactly what companies like Boeing would hope that they do at a moment like that, and that is why the airline industry is as safe as it is. We caused the problem, and we understand that. Over these last few weeks, I've had tough conversations with our customers, with our regulators, congressional leaders, and more."", ""We understand why they are angry, and we will work to earn their confidence. There is no message, no slogan that will accomplish that. It's all about real demonstrated action and absolute transparency every step of the way. So, let's talk about those steps."", 'Our team has worked diligently to help our customers restore their 737-9 airplanes to service. The FAA approved the detailed inspection protocol last Wednesday. And today, all 737-9 operators are safely returning their airplanes in service. More broadly, we are taking immediate and comprehensive action to strengthen quality at Boeing and within our supply chain.', 'We instituted additional quality controls and inspections at Boeing and at our supplier. We issued bulletins to suppliers to strengthen the focus on conformance and reducing the risks of quality escapes. We opened our factories to 737 operators for additional direct oversight. And we appointed an expert quality advisor to conduct a comprehensive and independent review of our commercial airplane quality management system, and they will remain with us for many years.', ""Most importantly, last week, we paused 737 production for the day as more than 10,000 teammates across Renton, Seattle, and Moses Lake stopped to focus on safety and quality and only safety and quality. This was a quality stand down at a scale we have never done before, and we're going to keep doing them across our commercial factories. In addition to our internal actions, the FAA has announced new oversight of our 737 manufacturing. We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn."", ""We respect their role as our regulator, and we will follow their direction in every step on production. Today, we're producing 737s at a rate of 38 per month, and we will remain at that rate until the FAA and Boeing is satisfied with our quality and manufacturing process. This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us, from our regulator, or from third parties, will make us better. It's that simple."", ""Over the last several years, we've taken close care not to push the system too fast, and we have never hesitated to slow down, to halt production, or to stop deliveries to take the time we need to get things right. Nobody knows that better than our investors. As you know, we stopped delivering 787s for over a year to ensure that each conform to our exacting specifications prior to delivery. And on the 737 line, we have regularly slowed rate breaks to support the stability of the overall production system and to correct nonconformances when identified."", 'But this accident makes it absolutely clear we have more work to do. I know that these moments that impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and our investors, but quality and safety must come above all else. And our customers and our investors know that and are in there with us. On that note, as you will see, we are not issuing financial outlook for 2024 today.', ""Now is not the time for that. We won't predict timing. We won't get ahead of our regulator. We will go slow to go fast."", ""And we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down if that's what's needed. We will simply focus on every next airplane and ensuring we meet all the standards that we have, all the standards that our regulator has and that our customers demand. As we go about that work, we remain confident in our recovery. Since day one, we've been focused squarely on inculcating safety and quality into everything that we do and getting back to our legacy of having engineering excellence at the center of our business."", ""That focus and commitment is unwavering, and we will continue to strengthen our processes and our execution every step of the way. Most importantly, we will be transparent every step of the way. And with our 170,000 employees in mind, I'd like to close with a message directly to our team. We have confidence in you and we have confidence in Boeing."", 'We have confidence in our airplanes. I know how seriously you take your work. Our men and women on the manufacturing floor and in our engineering offices know exactly what we must do. You know your work better than anyone else on the planet.', 'Use your voice. Speak up. Focus on every next detail. We will seek out and act on your feedback.', ""We're in a challenging moment. We will earn trust back through demonstrated action and a commitment to total transparency. I'm confident in you. I'm confident in our company."", 'And that together, we will do just that. Brian, over to you.', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's start off with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $22 billion. That's up 10% year over year."", 'Growth was driven by higher commercial volume and favorable mix. The core loss per share was $0.47, better than last year, primarily on improved commercial volume, better mix, and lower abnormal costs. They were offset by lower defense margins and higher period expenses, including R&D, which we expected. Free cash flow was $3 billion in the quarter, in line with the prior year and up sequentially from the third quarter, primarily due to improved commercial deliveries and strong order activity, which drove favorable advanced payment timing, some of which was anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.', ""Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing commercial airplanes. BCA booked 611 net orders in the quarter, with 411 737s, including an order with Akasa; 98 777Xs, largely an Emirates order; and 83 787s. We have over 5,600 airplanes in backlog, valued at $441 billion. BCA delivered 157 airplanes in the quarter, and revenue was $10.5 billion."", ""That's up 13%, driven by higher wide-body deliveries and favorable mix. Operating margin was just positive at 0.4%, driven by returning to normal 737 delivery levels in the quarter, improved mix, as well as lower abnormal costs associated with getting to five per month on the 87 and resuming production on the 777X. Now, I'll give more color on the key programs. On the 737, we delivered 110 airplanes in the quarter and 45 in December."", ""The program also began FAA certification flight testing on the 737-10 in December. For the year, we delivered 396 airplanes, on the upper end of the revised guidance range we provided in October. For the FAA announcement, we'll maintain production at 38 per month and work transparently with the FAA to complete all requirements for future increases. At the same time, we'll continue to prioritize the master schedule to avoid disruption in our supply chain."", ""On the 737-9, we're actively supporting our customers' return to service activities. And as of today, the majority are back flying. In our factory, we have 10 -9s in production, all of which will undergo the FAA-approved inspection process prior to delivery. Spirit has also adopted this inspection routine in its factory."", ""The quarter ended with about 200 MAX airplanes in inventory. It's important to think about this inventory in three buckets. First, there are 140 737-8s built prior to 2023. The vast majority are for customers in China and India."", 'We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we work toward shutting down the shadow factory. In the second bucket, there were around 25 airplanes produced in 2023 that are still in WIP given the disruptions in the second half of last year, and we expect these to deliver in 2024. And lastly, there are approximately 35 -7s and -10s that we will deliver once those airplanes are certified. The timing of which will be determined by the FAA.', ""Moving on to the 787. We delivered 23 airplanes in the quarter, including 11 in December. For the year, we delivered 73 airplanes, within the guidance range we originally outlined for 2023. The program successfully transitioned production to five per month in the quarter, and still plan to steadily work our way to 10 per month in the '25, '26 time frame."", 'We ended the quarter with approximately 60 airplanes in inventory, about 50 of which require rework, which continues to progress steadily. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory. We booked $77 million of abnormal cost in the quarter and have approximately 300 million left to go that will wind down by year-end, in line with our expectations. On the 777X, we resumed production in the quarter and continue to progress along the program timeline, which remains unchanged.', 'During the quarter, the Emirates order for 90 777Xs brought the program backlog to more than 400 airplanes and also extended the accounting quantity. We continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the certification process, including working to obtain approval from the FAA to begin certification flight testing. We booked $71 million of abnormal cost in the quarter, which is now fully behind us after resuming production, in line with our expectations. Moving to the next page, Boeing defense and space.', 'BDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including the Lot 10 award from the U.S. Air Force for 15 KC-46A tankers. The backlog is now at $59 billion. Revenue was $6.7 billion, up 9% on the tanker award and improved volume, and BDS delivered 52 aircraft and two satellites in the quarter.', ""Operating margin was minus 1.5% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from 3Q, but still, we have more work to do. 4Q results were impacted by cost true-ups on three fixed-price development programs totaling $139 million, as well as unfavorable performance and mix on other programs. Our game plan to get BDS back to high single-digit margins by the '25, '26 time frame remains unchanged. Our core business remains solid, representing 60% of our revenue and performing in the mid- to high-single-digit margin range."", ""The demand for these products is very strong, and we need to execute, compete, and grow these offerings. On the 25% of the portfolio, primarily comprised of fighter satellite programs, operational performance stabilized as we exited the year. And as a result, the fourth quarter saw improved margin trends, although still negative. We still expect to return to the strong historical performance levels as we roll in new contracts with tighter underwriting disciplines as we move into the '25, '26 time frame."", 'Lastly, we have our fixed-price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of revenue. Despite the relatively modest cost true-ups in the quarter, we continue to focus on maturing these programs and retiring risks quarter in and quarter out, and we made some good progress in the fourth quarter. In addition to capturing the tanker award from the U.S. Air Force, the program delivered nine aircraft in the fourth quarter, continuing to build positive momentum in spite of the supply related disruptions to the factory that we faced earlier last year.', ""And on the T-7A, the first Red Hawk arrived at Edwards Air Force Base in November, formally starting the Air Force development flight test campaign for the aircraft. Overall, the defense portfolio is poised to improve. The strong demand across the customer base, the products are performing the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive execution and stability will return this business to performance levels that our investors recognize. Moving on to the next page, Boeing global services."", 'BGS had another strong quarter. They received $6 billion in orders, and the backlog is now at $20 billion. Revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6%, primarily on favorable commercial volume and mix. Operating margins were a very strong 17.4%, an expansion of 350 basis points versus last year as both our commercial and government businesses were delivering double-digit margins.', ""In the quarter, BGS opened a parts distribution center in India and received a follow-on contract to provide sustainment for the C-17. Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $16 billion. On debt, the balance remained flat at $52.3 billion."", ""And over the next few days, we'll pay down $4 billion of the $5 billion of maturities coming due this year from our available cash on hand. We continue to maintain access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. Our liquidity position remains strong. Our investment-grade credit rating continues to be a priority."", ""And we're developing -- deploying capital in line with the priorities we've shared previously: invest in the business and pay down debt. Turning to the next page, I'll cover our full year financials. Full year revenue was $77.8 billion, up 17% year over year. Growth was driven by improved commercial volume, primarily on higher 787 deliveries."", ""The core loss per share was $5.81, better than prior year, primarily on improved commercial volume and mix, as well as lower fixed-price development charges in defense. Free cash flow was $4.4 billion for the year, up versus prior year, primarily on higher 787 deliveries and favorable receipt timing that was partially offset by higher expenditures as we increase production rates and invest in the business. While we're postponing issuing 2024 guidance today given our current focus, we're committed to sharing timely and transparent updates moving forward. I would like to provide some additional context on our path forward."", ""We always knew 2024 was going to be an important year in our recovery. Based on what we know today, we expect another steady year of free cash flow, driven by the 737 production at 38 per month, ongoing execution of the 787 toward our long-term objectives, continued liquidation of our 737 and 787 inventory, and continued focus to wind down both shadow factories. Our defense business will continue to improve as we mature fixed-price programs and transition recently challenged programs with better underwriting disciplines that we've already started to see. And BGS will continue to generate strong free cash flow."", ""Longer term, we're focused on quality and stability, which will ultimately drive free cash flow. Nothing has changed on the demand front, and the backlog is strong and growing. Remember, our '25, '26 guidance was based on achieving stability, and we have to earn that by applying resources to fix our issues and demonstrate predictability one airplane at a time, side by side with our regulator. This team is up to the challenge and will apply any and all resources to get back to deliveries that satisfy our customers and underwrite the long-term demand profile."", ""We're still confident in the goals we laid out for '25, '26, although it may take longer in that window than originally anticipated, and we won't rush the system. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for closing comments."", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Brian. We're addressing you from Renton, home of the 737 MAX family. We're living in the here and now, and we're working with all of our people."", ""And I couldn't be more impressed with their commitment, dedication, and the comprehensive nature around which they will look at this. Boeing will get better. I am confident in that. We will address everything that needs to be learned from the accident, and we'll move forward."", 'So, thanks. Happy to take your questions.', '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from the line of Peter Arment. Please go ahead.', 'Peter Arment -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Good morning, Dave and Brian.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, Peter.', 'Peter Arment -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', ""Dave, thanks for the initial open color on the MAX situation and the steps being taken. So, I guess just to follow on that, Dave, I wanted to ask you about where you assess you are in kind of the recovery of the MAX program when we think about what has been a successful transition to rate 38 and some of the progress in stabilizing the supply chain, and you've commenced deliveries to China. And I know we're not talking about '25, '26 targets, but directionally, there's been a lot of improvements since last fall and since your Investor Day when you laid out this long-term outlook. Thanks."", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Peter, I appreciate that. By the way, one stat which I was just handed which I track all the time is the number of our -9s that have been returned into service. We're at 129."", ""And that is progressing at a very quick rate based on the inspection protocols that our FAA and we all agreed with. I am very proud of the progress that we've made, and I feel great about it. Of course, with one exception, and it's too big an exception, which is the escape. I also know that as the NTSB investigation narrows and concludes, and I do believe that will happen in relatively short order, all the learning that can be extracted from it and all the learning that can be extracted from all those inspections of all those airplanes flying day in and day out, that will inform us on what improvements we can make on our quality systems."", ""First and foremost, we will run the door plug literally from the second a door is received at Wichita through their lines, all 12 positions, through our 11 positions here. Inspections will be added at every turn. It is on lockdown. And we've had help from our FAA, we've had help from our customers, etc."", ""So, that's sort of Step 2. The next one is how do you take all of that learning and apply it through all the supply chain lines? And we have some medium- and long-term efforts just beginning to make sure that we do that. My confidence comes from quality systems always can get better. And when you have a moment like this, you take everything."", ""You literally look at everything. And we're all keenly aware of everything. So, we're going to run that play as hard as we can. And we're going to take the time to do it in the FAA."", ""I'm sort of glad they called out a pause because that's a good excuse to just take our time, do it right. And I wish I had called that out on the first day, but maybe I would have. We've been good at taking pauses. I've probably taken more pauses in the last three years, and I'll apologize to all our investors now, than have been taken in 10 years before it."", ""But this is what we do and it's how we get better. And I also say, Peter, as you know, one of the nagging issues that we've been facing have been shortages here and there where we have to pause our line. Buffer inventory is not quite as robust as we'd like them to be based on supply chain weaknesses. We will run our master schedule in accordance with the plans that preceded this."", 'And each and every part we receive and all the buffer inventories that we get will stabilize production here on out. Less traveled work in our line. All things good come from that. So, I feel really good about it.', ""And I also have confidence in our airplanes that will be certified. I like the respect that the FAA and Boeing are showing one another. Again, I -- maybe too long a diatribe, but there are lots of sound reasons for why I'm feeling good. And in some ways, this moment will accelerate recovery, not delay it."", 'Peter Arment -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'And just initial progress on China. Thanks.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, Peter, as we've talked many, many, many times, we have stood by our customers in China day in and day out. They have been flying MAXs now for the better part of the year. They are performing extremely well."", ""And we'd always hoped than expected they would begin to take deliveries. And I think everybody has noticed that those deliveries have started. So, we are just going to stay diligent and stay with each and every one of them and make sure our Chinese customers get what they've ordered and paid for."", 'Peter Arment -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Thanks so much, Dave.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yup.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.', 'Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Good morning, Dave and Brian. Maybe if you could update us on how you're thinking about the MAX 10 and the MAX 7 certification timing just given the MAX 7 exemption being withdrawn. What does it mean for the 10 and how does that phase in as you think about ramping production to 50 a month and the profit profile of the MAX line if there's no MAX 7 or 10?"", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sheila, thanks for that question. I'm going to just give a little bit of a moment on why we made that decision on the time-limited exemption. I'll let Brian help quantify it. I visited Capitol Hill for a lot of reasons."", ""My biggest one is to own the problem, be transparent, and convey that to all of our workforce so that they know we're willing to do that and then we can all be honest, clear with each other every step of the way in this process. And I'm -- so I'm glad I made the visit. I was not expecting, when I met with Senator Duckworth, the conversation that we had. You know she's a pilot and a decorated pilot."", ""She listened to everything I had to say. We didn't have a debate about the safety of the 7. And the 7 in its certification work was moving along at a pretty steady pace. She had a way different argument for me, and it was right."", ""She said, you want to introduce this new airplane? A derivative, yes, but a new airplane. And nine months from now, you'll have an engineered solution to it, to this issue. And why is that the right call? And in my view, it was a sound, principled position to take. I went home for the weekend."", 'I talked to our customer. You know who that is. Unbelievably constructive. And this is the right thing to do and for aviation.', ""So, that is really how it happened. And it was that simple. But the passion and the argument that Senator Duckworth presented to me, I'm so glad I heard. Anyway, that's what happened."", ""The 7 will have to move until we get that engineered fix in place. And then I'll let Brian sort of quantify the, OK, now what?"", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. And on the 7, the work at hand, we will design an engineering solution. We're applying the resources. Our view is that that could be within a year."", ""But on the 7, remember, while it's very, very important customer, the number of deliveries you're talking about is relatively small. As I mentioned, we've got 35 of -7 and -10s in inventory at the end of the quarter. There's a handful of 10s. They're mostly 7s."", ""So -- but we'll sort that out as the process works and that airplane, per the FAA, gets certified. On your question on the -10, you know, I prefer not to get into what-ifs. It is a great airplane. Customers love it, and there's great demand for it."", ""And it'll get certified at some point when the FAA decides."", 'Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.', 'Myles Walton -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Brian, you alluded to 2024 being another, I think the words were steady year of free cash flow. I think in sort of follow-on descriptions, you gave a lot of uppers to what's going to happen year on year. So, is steady meaning growth in free cash flow, and/or can you give some of the offsets to the uppers? Thanks."", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Thanks, Myles. So, I did describe some of the key ones. Obviously, BCA volume up.', ""BDS less of a drag. BGS steady. There's a big investment in there that probably should have called out now that you're asking. It's a 777X investment."", ""That's important and that's big. And also, we got a plan for, you know, making sure that we stay laser-like our supply based on the master schedule. We don't want them to take their foot off on what they're doing. And if that means we got to hold more inventory, so be it."", ""It's important because, at this moment, it will allow us to have any of our suppliers that might have been at the line, might stand short of the line, they get a chance to catch up. So, all of that in the mix, our leverage that we got to deal with as we move into the year. And in terms of what steady means, you know, our belief, as we stand here today, the bottom end will look a lot like it did last year and maybe a little bit of growth. And once we know more, we'll put more specificity around it, and we'll give normal guidance when adequate and when appropriate."", 'Myles Walton -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Hey. Thanks very much and good morning.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Seth.', 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Brian, you talked a couple of times about the shadow factories and, you know, the path toward winding them down over the next year and change. Is there any way to quantify, you know, how you think about what the cost of those shadow factories was in 2023 or what you expect it to be in 2024?', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, thanks. I would -- the impact, you're not going to see in 2024 just because we still have to move that work through the system. But as we exit, it will be largely behind us."", ""As we think about our expectations on BCA profitability over time, we've always talked to it getting back to normal. A lot of that productivity will be not only what volume might look like, can't say a lot about that now, but also we don't have this resource with the shadow factories. So, we won't quantify it specifically, but it is an important component as we think about going from what our profitability has looked like at BCA historically and where we think we can get to."", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""And maybe I'll just add and refresh everybody's memory because we've talked about it a couple of times. In our shadow factories, we put more hours into those airplanes than we do to produce it in the first place. So, anyway, that's -- I -- that's a metric I know everybody understands."", 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Great. Maybe if I could sneak in one more to the advances. It was a nice tailwind in '23. You know, how do you think about that in '24?"", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""You know, right now, you know, we plan for obviously not to be quite what it was in 2023. That's factored into my comments. The good news is, is that we still have a pretty robust demand environment, and our commercial teams are working hard to chase every next order. So, we're not counting on a big one, but we know that our teams can go win campaigns."", 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thanks very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.', 'Jason Gursky -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, everybody. Brian, just maybe a quick clarification, or maybe Dave, and then a question on defense. The clarification is on the rate of 38 a month.', ""Do you guys still firing some blanks so that the number that you're actually producing is a little bit less than that? Just kind of curious what rate 38 means. And then on defense, Brian, you've historically broken things down into that 60-25-15 bucket. You talked a little bit about the 25% bucket and 15% bucket in your remarks. I was wondering if you just comment on the 60%, the remaining part of the portfolio, and how that's performing, and where maybe margins are in that slug of business at this point."", 'Thanks.', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. I'll take the first one. Yeah, we've cycled to 38 per month. We said that."", ""Keep in mind, it always takes time for that to equate into deliveries, but we're not firing blanks. On your question on the 60% of the portfolio on BDS. Look, you know, they've consistently quarter in and quarter out has still been able to deliver some very good performance on some products that the customers need. And you know the laundry list that we talked about, things like Apache and all that sort of stuff, missiles and weapons."", ""Things that are needed right now in this environment that we live in. And they're performing well, and they're in that mid- to high-single-digit margin rate. And when we step back, if we think about going from where BDS is with margins, two things have to happen. That 25% that's wrapped around fighters and satellites, that has to get better."", ""We still expected it to get better and look a lot like it used to. So then you've got 85% of your portfolio clicking at stable, consistent mid- to high single-digit rates. And we know we can get there. And then you've got this 15% of the portfolio on fixed-price development programs that we expect to be less of a drag as we retire risk over time."", 'And we expect that to play out.', 'Jason Gursky -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.', 'Doug Harned -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Good morning. Thank you.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Hi, Doug.', 'Doug Harned -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""Hi. I want to go back to the MAX 7 and the MAX 10 certification. And the question I have is when you look forward and given there is uncertainty on the timing of the certification of each one of those and you look at both the mix and your customer demand. And certainly, you've had, you know, more demand than you can respond to given supply chain issues."", ""First, let's say that mix changes because of the timing of certification on those two variants. Are you still -- do you still see your line as full because it could be moved around between -7s, 8s, 9s, 10s? And then second, what kind of operational challenges, if any, do you have when you have to have some flexibility about what variant you're producing?"", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""You know, Doug, I'll just start by saying I think it's manageable. We will have -- this -- if there's a delay in any way, we're not going to know at the last second. We're going to know with a considerable time frame, in my view. And by the way, right now, the status on 7 and the 10 was progressing reasonably well."", ""I don't believe the FAA has taken anybody off the course, and we haven't taken anybody off the course. And so, they are making real progress. And I think we were almost close to the finish line had we not pulled, you know, the time-limited exemption. So, I don't -- again, I'm never going to suggest a date or anything like that for the FAA, but they're working diligently on it, and they know how to separate these two -- these -- the issue we're wrestling with in our factory from the cert efforts."", ""And I believe we're going to have plenty of time, and we'll be able to manage our product mix reasonably well. There won't be anything dramatic by way of change. If there are some subtle changes from quarter to quarter, first or second, you'll know it pretty early and so will we. And I think it's quite manageable."", 'Doug Harned -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'So, is it fair to say that the supply chain ramp is probably still the governing constraint on your production ramp, not things like mix here?', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. Although, I will say, if this pause goes on for a little while, you know, I don't like -- I don't want to pause my customers. But the pause is going to be helpful for us in so many ways in the sense that that supply chain, they're going to keep running according to that master schedule. It's good for us if some buffers get developed and some of the more stressed suppliers get ahead of the game."", 'So, there is important progress that will get made despite this momentary pause.', 'Doug Harned -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Very good. Thank you.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Thanks, Doug.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, Ron.', 'Ron Epstein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Good morning. Hey. Good morning.', ""How are you? If I may, I have, like, a two-part question, if that's OK. Yeah, the first one, if you guys could walk through 787 a little bit. You mentioned the rate. What's going on in that line, that sort of thing? We get questions about that."", ""And then I'll come back with the second part in a sec."", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, on the 787, there's nothing new on the 87. Teams doing a very nice job. We'll produce at the five-per-month rate, like we described."", ""We expect to steadily increase those rates over time and liquidate a lot of inventory. A lot of inventory. And, you know, we'll give more dimensions around the specifics in line with normal guidance. But the program is doing just fine, and the backlog is big."", 'Ron Epstein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Yeah, it's been doing great. And then maybe the second question, this one's maybe a little more difficult. The -- I'm still trying to get my head around how we got here, meaning, you know, if you go back to the beginning of the MAX issue, wasn't the 737 line like the most scrutinized production line in the world? So, I mean, what happened to get to where we got today? You know, I understand that, you know, revamping the quality system and all that. It's all great news."", ""It's a positive move forward. But why did that have to happen now? And I just don't understand that."", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, Ron, it's a -- it should never happen. So, the question about now is that not so relevant? It should never and can never happen. I am incredibly proud of the work that our people do on the 37 line. I think it has steadily progressed."", 'Quality numbers have gotten better. But then when you have an escape and then when everybody concludes exactly what happened in that escape, that lights another fire. So, you take another step forward with respect to all things quality. And you make certain that whatever it was that created that opportunity for failure in the sky or in flight can never happen again.', ""And that has already happened. And then we'll learn from everything. So, yeah, I think I understand your underlying context for the question, but I probably take exception to that premise."", 'Ron Epstein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'OK.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'Cai von Rumohr -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Yes. Thanks so much. So, now that you've waived the exemption on the engine anti-icing and your redesign -- you're designing the new system, you said it would take about a year. Have you accelerated that at all and could you accelerate it more because my assumption is that is going to be the long pole in the tent in terms of when you -- when the FAA can certify the MAX 7 and 10?"", 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I think that is an accurate statement that you just made given the fact that we made this decision just a couple of days ago. Needless to say, we will throw more engineers at it. We're going to put more work into it. And I hope we can accelerate it."", ""And the nine months that I discussed with Senator Duckworth was based on my understanding of that project before I made this decision. So, the answer is yes. We'll step up resources. We'll step up whatever testing is required."", ""We will do everything we can to inform the FAA about that particular part of that program. So -- and that's where we stand today. And you are correct. That is the pole in the tent all of us should be watching."", 'Cai von Rumohr -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Terrific. Thank you. And then another quick one. You know, with the supply chain running at the master schedule but you're delivering not quite as many, should we think about a fairly large build in the inventory account here in the next couple of quarters until you get beyond that?"", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. There's two things, Cai, that are going to be things we have to deal with in cash flow. One is going to be the 777X investment I discussed, as well as what you just described. And that's contemplated in my description of what we thought the bottom look like."", ""And then we just got to go run the play and, you know, work through what's in front of us. But more work ahead, and we'll describe it more specifically as we move through the year."", 'Cai von Rumohr -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Matt Welch -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Hey, Lois, we have time for one more question.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And that question will come from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, everyone.', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Hey, Noah.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, Noah.', 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Might go over one if I'm last, but, Brian, recognizing that there are some limitation here in how you can discuss it, but maybe just trying to talk out MAX units this year with assumptions of not breaking to higher rates. You know, you made it a point to say you're at 38. I know, you know, that rate final assembly where the entire supply chain is is always a different number. But, you know, if I just simply said 31 for six months and 38 for six months, that's in the low 400s."", 'And then you unwind five to 10 of inventory a month. You know, I can kind of get, you know, somewhere near a 500 or just decent growth from 2023. Is that just a reasonable starting point as we wait to learn more from the FAA?', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""You know, Noah, I completely understand the question. Those are the inputs I described. But, you know, I -- out of respect for the process that we need to go through with the FAA, I just got to steer away from specificity. It's just not the right time."", ""We've got work in front of us. And I promise, when appropriate, we are going to be more specific. But anyway, that's -- it's probably going to be on the specificity of those numbers, wait and see. It's just not appropriate."", 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Yup. Fair enough. Fair enough. Are you willing and able to speak to just updating what the cap is these days on the monthly inventory unwind and how China plays into that?', 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""I don't know if we think about a cap. We've got these shadow factories that have been working for, you know, quite a while, and they know the routines and they've been pretty steadily on both 37 and the 87, consistently meeting month-in and month-out liquidation targets and expectations for customers. So, I don't think there's any kind of cap. We're just focused on -- we know exactly the pile of inventory."", ""It's 140 on the 37 that I described. It's 50 on the 87 that have to get the rework. And we're just going to move through this year with real focus in order to be at a position where we start shutting these shadow factories down. And then we're just going to run that play as hard as we can."", 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""OK. And is China officially fully 100% taking deliveries? We see it in the press. We see the reading of the tail number websites. But can you just declare that that's just fully officially on at this point?"", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'One at a time. And yes.', 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""OK. And then, Brian, just one more defense. You know, the margins still not where you want it, but better sequentially. Any framework you can provide around how that progresses through '24? And what was the final defense cash burn in the '23 cash so we can think about where -- you know, what to work off of as we go into '24?"", 'Brian West -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, the cash burn, we put out some numbers a year ago, and we thought the operating cash flows by division. BDS, the worst-case end for them in that range, they were much worse than that. And it's all what we've described last year, and we expect it to be better this year, and that's behind us."", 'But yet, they did a lot worse. Obviously, offset by BGS and BCA doing better. But it was worse. And then the first part of your question on margins, you know, we expect margin trajectories to get better over time, particularly as we focus on this 25% of the portfolio.', ""That is very specific and there's a lot of actions or activity around it. But we will get better. They will eventually get to the point where we're putting positives on the board. What I'm most interested is the team has got to execute over the next -- between now and 2025, '26 in order to get these margins back in the high-single-digit range."", ""And I will remind you that that's how we describe our defense margins. You really got to put 2 points on top of that, which is what we account for in our global services division for the defense side. So, it's really looking more like a double-digit defense external view that we are aiming to get toward because we think that's a pretty decent business."", 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Right. OK.', 'Dave Calhoun -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'And you squeezed in three.', 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'We got in. We got them all in. Got the rest in.

Certain designers apply drapes directly to mannequins, letting the material flow and ebb to create an organic appearance. Gorgeous, opulent, and supple materials may inspire designers and can give rise to incredible works of art.', 'Fabric is created by felting, knitting, or weaving fibers together. Fabrics include synthetic fibers such as polyester and nylon as well as natural fibers such as cotton, wool, and silk, which are used to make furniture, clothes, and other items. Recent years have seen strong growth in the global fabric market. It is expected to grow from $116.67 billion in 2023 to $123.42 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 5.8%, according to a report by The Business Research Company.', ""The automotive industry's rapid expansion, the rising need for man-made fibers, and the robust economic growth in emerging markets are the main growth drivers of this sector. The size of the textiles market is anticipated to increase steadily over the next few years, reaching $148.78 billion at a 4.8% CAGR in 2028. The two main expansion drivers of this industry are - the rising demand for home furnishings and online retailing. In 2023, Western Europe followed the Asia-Pacific in dominating the global textiles market. As the largest textile-producing and exporting country in the world, China's textile industry has become one of the main economic pillars in recent years, and the Red Dragon is renowned as the Country with the Best Fabric Quality.\xa0"", ""Who doesn’t want to look good? Just the way people cannot live without food, most of them cannot live without clothes as it is one of the necessities of life. For clothing producers, fabric quality is crucial because it directly impacts their bottom line. For instance, long-lasting, high-quality cloth minimizes the need for frequent replacements, saving manufacturers money on production expenses and minimizing the number of returns or complaints. It additionally enhances the brand's reputation, which strengthens consumer loyalty and eventually boosts revenue.\xa0"", ""The high-end textile industry’s expansion is dependent on several variables: the increasing influence of various marketing tactics on consumers' purchasing decisions, the elevated standard of living of consumers in developed countries, and the rising desire for eco-friendly and sustainable clothing.\xa0"", 'However, the global economic crisis is making it more difficult to produce and deliver high-end, high-quality fabrics. Insufficient demand from developing and poor nations resulting from the high costs related to the raw materials needed to create pricey fabrics, which would ultimately contribute to the high costs of finished products and hinder the growth of the textile sector. The global coronavirus pandemic has acted as a serious impediment to the fabric manufacturing industry as well, disrupting supply chains through trade restrictions and causing a drop in demand as a result of government-imposed lockdowns. Particularly for makers of premium fabrics, rising costs of labor, raw materials, and energy present serious hurdles.\xa0\xa0', 'The global high-end fabric industry is a lucrative one despite an array of obstacles. Products are capital intensive, yet they yield a healthy return on investment. Consumers who are pleased with the fabric quality of the goods are more likely to stick around, spreading positive word-of-mouth, which encourages repeat business. Furthermore, longer-lasting textiles can delay deterioration in contrast to low-quality fabrics and lengthen the life of goods, making it a treasure that can be inherited by the generations to come.\xa0', ""Waking up to the environmental damage, the textile industry is finally compensating, turning fashion designers and textile producers to sustainable fabrics to create their products. The USA has stepped up its game and now has an extensive array of green textile companies and distributors using a variety of modern technologies. Thereby, making it a piece of cake for procurement agents and fashion designers to source ethical and eco-friendly products. The size of the global sustainable fabrics market was estimated at $26.45 billion in 2022, and is expected to grow at a rapid CAGR of 13.3% until 2032, per EmergenResearch.

In contrast to the previous year, when exchange-traded funds (ETFs) emphasizing dividend strategies attracted over $60 billion from cautious investors, 2023 saw a notable decline. Dividend-focused ETFs garnered only $1.5 billion throughout the year, marking one of the lowest collection figures on record. This lackluster outcome was primarily attributed to the fact that most of these funds didn't fully participate in the technology-driven market surge, resulting in underperformance compared to the broader S&P 500 index."", 'Despite the less-than-stellar performance of dividend stocks in the previous year, their significance for income investors remains intact. Analysts are optimistic about the comeback of dividend equities in 2024. A report from Capital Group suggested that as economic growth is anticipated to slow down in 2024, and the possibility of a recession looms, dividends might play a more crucial role in enhancing total returns for investors. Diana Wagner, an equity portfolio manager for Washington Mutual Investors Fund, shared insights on dividend stocks in the report and stated:', '“It is difficult to know when a cycle will turn, so investors may want to look for companies with growth potential\xa0as well as businesses that pay dividends, which can help mitigate market volatility. Valuation is important, but it is essential to distinguish between real values and companies with deteriorating business prospects.”', ""This performance of dividend stocks in 2023 suggested that these stocks may offer valuable benefits to investors in the long term. Historical analysis further reinforces this viewpoint. Examining the average stock performance over an extended period offers a more detailed perspective. In the period from 1930 to 2022, the contribution of dividend income to the total return of the S&P 500 Index averaged 41%. However, savvy investors don't necessarily subscribe to the notion of long-term benefits from dividend stocks. Instead, they actively engage in short-term investments using a strategy known as Dividend Capture. This approach focuses on exploiting the periodic dividend payouts of stocks without committing to a long-term hold. Investors employing Dividend Capture aim to capture the dividend income by strategically buying and selling stocks around the ex-dividend date, optimizing their returns in the short term. To learn about this strategy, have a look at our previous article titled Dividend Capture Strategy: 10 High Yield Stocks To Buy in November."", 'Even when engaging in short-term investments, investors consistently prioritize companies that have a track record of consistently raising their dividends.

But the drugmaker actually jumped into the global spotlight not long ago when it launched its blockbuster coronavirus vaccine, Comirnaty, followed by top-selling COVID treatment Paxlovid. These two products helped Pfizer reach a record $100 billion in annual revenue in 2022.', 'The past year, though, has been a difficult one for the big pharma company. Demand for coronavirus products has been on the decline, weighing significantly on earnings. That and losses of exclusivity concerning certain big non-COVID products later this decade have hurt investors\' appetite for Pfizer stock. The shares dropped 43% in 2023, a year that even CEO Albert Bourla says ""was not a good year for us.""', ""The company reported earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 this week, and though things remain difficult, Pfizer has offered investors some reasons to be optimistic about the future. Is the worst over for Pfizer? Let's find out."", 'The pharmaceutical giant started preparing shareholders for its 2023 results late last year, cutting guidance for Comirnaty and Paxlovid revenue. As part of this, Pfizer predicted a $4.2 billion noncash revenue reversal for the return of unused Paxlovid doses from the U.S. government.', 'As it turns out, the company delivered some positive news on the subject during its earnings report. The revenue reversal in the quarter was lower, at $3.5 billion, and Pfizer told CNBC that indicates more use of Paxlovid than expected.', ""Still, Pfizer's fourth-quarter earnings reflect its recent and ongoing challenges. As you can see in the chart, revenue tumbled more than 41% to $14.2 billion, and the company reported a net loss of $3.4 billion. On a brighter note, while restructuring and acquisition costs ballooned 222%, the company made progress lowering total expenses."", ""And Pfizer said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in annual net cost savings by the end of this year as part of its cost realignment plan -- this is up from the original goal of $3.5 billion. Pfizer set the plan in motion to match its cost base with its long-term revenue opportunities."", ""Now let's consider our question about whether the worst is over for Pfizer. The company's coronavirus products aren't likely to deliver growth in the near future because vaccine uptake isn't particularly high. This season, about 15% of the U.S. population went for a COVID shot."", ""The good news is that Pfizer is studying a combined COVID/flu vaccine candidate in clinical trials, and this sort of product could attract those who generally go for an annual flu shot -- that's nearly half of the U.S. population. If all goes well, such a product could launch around 2026."", ""As mentioned, some of Pfizer's biggest blockbusters -- like blood thinner Eliquis and cancer drug Ibrance -- are set to lose exclusivity later this decade. Pfizer expects losses of exclusivity to represent $17 billion in lost revenue from 2025 to 2030. But the good news is Pfizer's biggest streak of new drug launches ever should compensate and eventually lead to growth -- and business deals should be another growth driver too."", 'Pfizer predicts new drugs may deliver $20 billion in revenue by 2030, and business deals could bring in $25 billion in revenue by that time.', ""It's clear recent drug launches -- and big business deals like the recent acquisition of oncology specialist Seagen -- won't change the game for Pfizer overnight. But all of these moves today, along with the cost realignment plan, may be seen as the stepping stones to growth."", ""And to answer our original question, yes, the worst might be over for Pfizer. The company's cost realignment plan should bear fruit, and new drugs will start to contribute to sales, as will products gained through the Seagen purchase. And Pfizer just reaffirmed its 2024 guidance, which indicates revenue may grow as much as 5% from this year's level."", 'That means right now, with shares trading at only 12x forward earnings estimates, is a great time to get in on Pfizer -- and hold on for the long term to benefit from the potential growth that lies ahead.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

The company’s fourth quarter earnings report showed its vaccine business grew by 24% in 2023, compared to the prior year. Arexy’s launch played a large role in that growth, as did continued adoption of GSK’s shingles vaccine Shingrix.', 'Last May, Arexvy received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in adults 60 years or older, becoming the first preventive vaccine for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus. Pfizer followed quickly behind, securing a similar approval of its RSV shot Abrysvo several weeks later.', 'So far, GSK’s launch appears to outperforming Pfizer’s. On Tuesday, Pfizer reported Abrsyvo sales of $515 million for 2023.', 'GSK said it has won around two-thirds share of the U.S. market, where almost all Arexvy sales were recorded.

Unfortunately, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has severely underperformed all other technology stocks as it fell 24% over the past year while the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 34% over the same period.', 'The issues plaguing PayPal have been well documented, with the fintech giant succumbing to a wide range of endogenous and exogenous factors. The company has recently seen a rotation in its management, with Alex Chriss and Jamie Miller joining PayPal last year as CEO and chief financial officer.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PYPL.', 'The new CEO did give some early glimpses of what changes to expect as PayPal transitions in 2024, but his clearest guidance on its pivot to growth was given as management announced a slew of customer-focused innovative features last week.', ""After carefully reviewing the innovation roadmap and evaluating PayPal's financial statements, I believe the stock is undervalued."", ""The foundational offering of PayPal was to provide users with digital wallets, enabling them to easily transact online. Over time, the company's aspirations to become a fintech super app saw it make many acquisitions to rapidly expand its reach into newer extensions of its core fintech market. Venmo and Paidy are some of its well-known acquisitions and integrated as part of its Consumer Checkout business. Braintree was another acquisition made by PayPal and integrated as part of its Unbranded Processing business. Consumer Financial Services and Merchant Services are two of its other business units that help PayPal facilitate over 22 billion global financial transactions. In addition, the financial payments giant also ventured into complementary businesses such as cryptocurrency trading and buy now, pay later, which has became hugely popular in the post-pandemic era."", 'Since PayPal is in the business of facilitating financial transactions, it collects a take rate for facilitating transactions between parties. Therefore, growth in the volume of total payments it processes is paramount for its businesses. In addition, it may also collect additional fees based on certain products, such as loans, merchant credit, foreign exchange, etc. to process payments on its platform.', 'In an interview with CNBC earlier this month, Chriss hinted at some innovation-focused strategies the company will be adopting this year that will shock the world."" PayPal\'s management later followed up the interview by launching new innovative products at a special event a week later. While I believe the special event was a step in the right direction, I think the broader investor community would have benefited from some more direct, long-term financial guidance based on the product launches. Still, I think PayPal\'s management has received the feedback, and I firmly believe it will push management to issue more detailed guidance in the upcoming fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call.', ""In my view, a majority of the strategic direction was given by the CEO in the CNBC interview that I pointed to earlier in this section. The first milestone as part of management's transitional strategy is to focus on launching more customer-focused and merchant-focused products that drive higher transactions among PayPal's existing user base. Management's plan is to incentivize the existing user base by rewarding them with cash back. In addition, the company also plans to leverage the large warehouse of transactional and customer data and use artificial intelligence to personalize the customer's buyer journey experience with cash back incentives. Based on the third-quarter results that I have added below, I noticed a meaningful uptick of 15% year-over-year growth in the total payment volume. To me, these are some early but very encouraging signs of the fundamental health of the business. I mentioned previously that a higher TPV widens the scope of PayPal's take rate, which eventually drives up its margins."", ""The second milestone PayPal aims to achieve is higher usage among small and medium-sized businesses. Chriss is a veteran at building products and solutions for SMBs. Before joining PayPal, he led the product ecosystem for Inuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) Small Businesses and Self Employed group. On the recent earnings call, he underscored his commitment to focusing on the SMB market while further adding, small businesses are a passion of mine and This is not only important to PayPal and has been in the past, it's really been the lifeblood of the organization. Deploying more solutions for small businesses will allow PayPal to collect subscription fees and platform fees for all the solutions, such as marketing, credit and e-commerce solutions that the company has in the product pipeline for its SMB merchants."", ""The third milestone that Chriss covered in the CNBC interview was management's initiative to divest its businesses so as to focus on the core transaction processing businesses that generate margins for the company. In my opinion, PayPal attempted to hastily expand into emerging categories of the fintech market by acquiring companies that would not be margin-positive for the company. On the last earnings call, management announced it sold Happy Returns to UPS (NYSE:UPS) for $465 million for a meaningful profit. This year, I expect management to double down on their initiatives to divest parts of the business that are not contributing to the company's profit margins or core functions."", 'Through this year, I anticipate PayPal will be able to drive significant improvements in their margins based on the strategies Chriss alluded to in the interview.', ""Given that PayPal's margins have not been stable over the past two years, I will estimate its value using the reverse discounted cash flow model. Before I move over to free cash flow, I will note its balance sheet carries about $10.6 billion in a combination of senior notes and operating leases. A majority of the debt is senior notes, which it previously held, while a portion of the debt was acquired due to the nature of its BNPL business. I do not see this as a risk since PayPal holds about $11.5 billion in cash and short-term securities."", ""Moving onto PayPal's free cash, I see management is guiding for more than $4.6 billion in free cash for fiscal 2023. Still, I will take the trailing 12-month free cash of $3.18 billion for my model. Assuming a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 9%, I see the markets are currently pricing in an average annual free cash flow growth rate of 6.80% for the next 10 years at the current price level."", ""With the initiatives that management has planned for PayPal in 2024, I believe there is significant room for growth beyond the 6.80% that markets are pricing in at PayPal's current levels."", ""The single biggest threat to PayPal's entire business is the fierce competition in all the different segments of the fintech target market. Within its core digital wallet market, PayPal has already lost a significant share to Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), causing investors to lose faith in the company as an active user account. Apple Pay also competes with PayPal in the nascent but fast-growing BNPL market, which is also hotly contested."", ""Newer players such as Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) and current BNPL market leader Klaarna already innovate at a rapid pace, while PayPal's direct competitor, Block (NYSE:SQ), acquired Afterpay to compete here. Block's Square competes with PayPal directly in many fintech market segments, such as digital wallets, cryptocurrency trading, transaction processing and merchant solutions. PayPal also operates in the e-commerce transaction processing market by processing transactions via its PayPal-branded checkout and lower-margin unbranded checkout solutions, powered by Braintree. Over the past few months, the company has been able to gain market share in this space, especially in the North American region, at the expense of other incumbents such as Adyen and Stripe. But it has done so at the cost of lower transaction margins by accepting a lower take rate, which is not healthy for the business."", ""Since my valuation already prices in the worst, I do not expect any significant changes in PayPal's market position in each of these markets this year, but I will be monitoring this space since the fintech market is rapidly evolving."", ""Based on my analysis, I believe investors have priced in the worst for PayPal. Its recent customer innovation announcement did not resonate with the explicit long-term financial targets that markets were expecting, but I am encouraged by the CEO's outlook on his strategy for this year, leading me to believe the stock is undervalued as of today. PayPal reports its full-year 2023 earnings results next week."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paypal?', ""For Paypal, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.59%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paypal will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paypal would post earnings of $1.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of +6.56%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Paypal doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Numerous American companies have adhered to this principle, contributing to a notable increase in dividend distributions over the years. S&P Dow Jones Indices data revealed that the dividend payments of S&P 500 companies totaled $420 billion in 2017, surging to $565 billion in 2022. The trend continued in 2023, setting a new record with dividend payments reaching an impressive $588.2 billion. The most recent report from S&P Dow Jones pointed out that there were 707 instances of dividend increases in the fourth quarter of 2023. The cumulative amount of these increases reached $17.5 billion for the quarter, marking an increase from the $16.3 billion reported in the same period of 2022.', 'Companies displaying consistent growth in dividends have attracted the interest of investors, prompting companies to undertake the challenging task of sustaining and expanding their dividends, even during market downturns. This strategic approach has proven to be beneficial for these companies, as those experiencing dividend growth have yielded substantial returns over the years. According to a Cohen & Steers report, during the decade leading up to 2010, dividend-paying companies outpaced non-payers by 620 basis points annually, with significantly lower risk measured by standard deviation. Over a 30-year period ending in 2011, the advantage of dividend-paying companies becomes even more pronounced. Notably, across each time frame during this period, the subset of dividend payers that increased or initiated dividends in the preceding 12 months exhibited higher returns and lower volatility compared to both payers and non-payers.', 'Aside from delivering robust returns, consistent dividend stocks have been playing a significant role in generating personal income. As per findings from S&P Dow Jones Indices, dividends have progressively become a more substantial source of income over the past four decades. In December 1981, dividends constituted only 2.88% of total income, a figure that has increased to 6.25% of all income as of March 2022. The report also highlighted the average year-over-year annual percentage growth rate in dividends for the existing constituents of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index. Over the last 15 years, the average year-over-year dividend growth rate stood at 13.71%, outpacing the average year-over-year U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of 2.21% during the same timeframe.', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

After a brief review of our quarterly and annual performance, I intend to focus my remarks this morning on BXP's significant capital allocation activity over the last quarter, related real estate capital market conditions and key areas of focus for us in 2024.The operating trends I've described in prior quarters, specifically the steady return of workers to their offices, the importance of corporate earnings growth to leasing activity and the outperformance of Premier Workplaces, all remain important and substantially unchanged.BXP continued to perform in the fourth quarter as we did throughout 2023, despite withering negative market sentiment for the commercial real estate sector. Our FFO per share was $0.01 above market consensus for the fourth quarter and for all of 2023, was $0.15 above the midpoint of the guidance range we provided one year ago. We completed over 1.5 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and 4.2 million square feet of leasing for all of 2023, well above our prior forecast.Over the last year, signed leases remain long term over 8 years weighted average and portfolio occupancy remained stable, despite a challenging leasing environment.In 2023, BXP raised over $4 billion in new capital in the public unsecured debt, private secured mortgage and private equity markets. In the fourth quarter alone, we completed a new $600 million mortgage financing, a $750 million asset-specific equity capital raise, both among the largest comparable transactions completed in our sector last year as well as 3 new and highly accretive equity investments, one of which closed in January.So on capital allocation activities and starting with capital raising, last November, BXP announced the sale to Norges Bank Investment Management of a 45% interest in 290 and 300 Binney Street, both life science developments located in the Kendall Square District of Cambridge, leased on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients. 300 Binney is a 236,000 square foot existing office building that is being converted to lab use and scheduled for delivery at the end of this year, and 290 Binney is a 566,000 square foot ground-up development that we expect to deliver in 2026.Our partner purchased the assets at a gross valuation of $1.66 billion or $2,050 per square foot and an expected initial cash yield on cost at delivery for both assets of 5.9%.BXP will retain a 55% interest in each joint venture and provide development, property management and leasing services.Norges has closed its investment in 300 Binney and funded $213 million, and we expect the 290 Binney joint venture will close in the first quarter of this year, which will reduce approximately $534 million of BXP's development funding requirement over time.We are pleased and honored to grow our important relationship with Norges, BXP's largest joint venture partner and one of our largest shareholders.Upon completion of this transaction, BXP will have raised just under $750 million of equity capital on attractive terms and reduced our forecast leverage.Next, BXP purchased interest in 3 currently owned assets from 2 different joint venture partners, one of which closed in early January. These transactions were sparked by anchor client renewals BXP achieved at 2 of the assets, requiring capital for tenant improvements, leasing commissions and building upgrades.In the current environment, these 2 joint venture partners decided they wanted to reduce their exposure to office. We agreed to purchase their interest at attractive and accretive returns and complete the long-term lease extension.Regarding the specific deals, 901 New York Avenue is a 548,000 square foot, 83% leased office building located in Washington, D.C. The building is encumbered by a $207 million mortgage, with attractive terms due in 2025.In January, we completed the renewal of the 214,000 square foot anchor client in the building, Finnegan Henderson for 18 years, purchased the 50% interest in the property we didn't own for $10 million and modified the loan to allow for an extension of the maturity date for up to 5 years.Pricing for the acquisition was $414 per square foot and a 6.4% initial cap rate on an as-is basis, and $516 a square foot with an expected 8.4% cash yield on cost at stabilization in 2027.Santa Monica Business Park is a 21 building 1.2 million square foot and 88% leased office complex located adjacent to the Santa Monica Airport. The property is encumbered by a $300 million mortgage due in 2025, and 70% of the park is encumbered by a ground lease, with above-market ground rent and a fee purchase option in 2028.We completed a 467,000 square foot lease renewal for Snap, the anchor client in the park for 10 years, and purchased the 45% interest in the asset we didn't own for $38 million, which represents pricing of $395 per square foot and a 9% initial cap rate on a fee simple basis based on market assumptions for land value.Lastly, in conjunction with the Santa Monica Business Park buyout, BXP purchased a 29% interest in 360 Park Avenue South for $1, bringing our ownership interest in the asset to 71%. 360 Park Avenue South is a 450,000 square foot office building that BXP is fully redeveloping in Midtown South and is encumbered by a $220 million mortgage.Purchased 360 Park Avenue South using OP units priced at $111 per share in 2021 and subsequently introduced 2 financial joint venture partners, who secured their interest by funding the required redevelopment capital expenditures over time.At the time of closing, the selling joint venture partner had funded $71 million, and BXP assumed their remaining $46 million projected funding obligation. This investment represents pricing projected at building stabilization in 2026 of $754 per square foot and a 7.2% initial yield on cost.So in summary, for these 3 acquisitions, BXP invested only $48 million upfront and materially increased its ownership position in 3 high-quality assets we understand well. We expect to receive projected total returns that will be well in excess of the cost of the equity capital we've raised from the Binney Street joint ventures, and project FFO per share accretion from the investments of approximately $0.14 in 2024.Regarding the broader private equity capital markets, office sales volume picked up in the fourth quarter to $14.4 billion, up 126% from the prior quarter and up 14% from a year ago.Interestingly, office sales went from 12% of total real estate transaction volume in the third quarter, to over 27% last quarter. Though U.S. lenders continue to reduce exposure to office real estate, making secured financing extremely difficult to arrange, there is more distressed asset restructuring activity, more capitulation on pricing by owners and more confidence by buyers in their forecast cost of capital.The Fed's announced late last year that interest rate hikes are likely over and cuts could start to occur in 2024, is very favorable for real estate capital market conditions.There were a few comparable premier workplace transactions completed last quarter other than our Binney Street joint ventures. 1 West Side and West Side 2 in West L.A. sold for $700 million or over $1,000 a square foot, and a 6% cap rate to a user, but the economics are influenced by a lease buyout from the existing anchor tenant.Now turning to BXP's priorities for 2024. Our overriding goal is to leverage our competitive advantages to preserve and build FFO per share over time.Today, the key advantages for BXP are our commitment to the office asset class and our clients, as many competitors disinvest in the sector, a strong balance sheet with access to capital and the unsecured debt and private equity markets and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional acquisitions and development.Our primary focus for 2024 will be leasing, preserving and building over time our occupancy in addressing near and, in some cases, medium-term lease expirations, with our portfolio 88% occupied, leasing vacant space is our lead capital-intensive way to build back FFO. Doug will focus his comments on leasing markets and our expectations for leasing this year.A second focus for 2024 is new investment activity. Many office owners are facing existential risks, given slow leasing and limited secured financing, and many institutional owners want to diversify away from the office asset class.We said last quarter we intended to shift to offense on capital deployment, and this has started, given the 3 new investments I described. There are and will be significant additional investment opportunities available from both lenders and owners of property. Our focus will remain in our core markets on premier workplaces, life science assets and residential development.During the last market downturn caused by the global financial crisis, BXP was able to acquire premier workplaces such as the GM building, 200 Clarendon Street, 100 Federal Street and 510 Madison, all at attractive prices at the time.A third area of focus for us this year will be new development. We have 2 possibly 3 residential development opportunities under control that are being entitled and designed and we intend to raise joint venture equity capital for these projects in the second half of the year. We also continue to have dialogue with anchor clients for sites under control in Manhattan, though the discussions are in early phases and the outcomes are much less certain.Significant pre-leasing, higher expected development yields and joint venture equity would be required to launch any new premier workplace developments. We also have several specific sites and buildings that we are trying to reentitle in advance for near-term viable use based on market conditions.BXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 10 office, lab, retail and residential projects underway. These projects aggregate approximately 2.7 million square feet and $2.4 billion of BXP investment, with $750 million remaining to be funded after closing the 290 Binney Street joint venture, and are projected to generate attractive yields in the aggregate upon delivery.We will be opportunistic with dispositions in 2024. Market conditions are generally unfavorable for selling assets at attractive prices, but we are interested in raising capital through asset sales if favorable opportunities present themselves.To summarize, in the face of strong negative market sentiment, BXP executed well in 2023, leasing over 4 million square feet of space, raising over $4 billion of capital and launching 2 large-scale fully pre-leased life science developments. We displayed resilience with stable occupancy and a stable dividend, and our FFO per share is higher today than it was before the pandemic started in 2020.So we start the year with continued challenges in the leasing market, BXP is well positioned to gain market share in both assets and clients during this time of market dislocation.As a last closing remark, today represents a BXP milestone. This will be Bob Pester's last earnings call as he is retiring from BXP next month, after more than 25 years of service. Our San Francisco region grew significantly under Bob's capable leadership. Thank you very much, Bob. You will be missed by all of us at BXP.Over to Doug."", 'Douglas T. Linde', ""Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. After a moment of silence to Bob, I'm going to start.In early 2023, we established our baseline leasing expectations for our portfolio of about 3 million square feet in flat occupancy. As Owen commented, we ended the year with 4.2 million square feet, and the fourth quarter included our 467,000 square foot early renewal with Snap at Santa Monica Business Park.We executed about 500,000 square feet more than we expected in 2023, and it was primarily pulling forward some 2024 transactions. The Snap lease was part of our baseline expectations. And interestingly, it was only 1 of 2 leases in excess of 130,000 square feet that we executed in the portfolio during the year.On 12/31/22, so over -- just over a year ago, our in-service occupancy was 88.6%, and we finished the year, 12/31/23, at 88.4%, essentially flat. Our in-service portfolio is 49 million square feet, so 20 basis points amounts to 98,000 square feet, sort of a rounding era.Maintaining portfolio occupancy in the current environment is an accomplishment in its own right. Our large lease expirations in 2024 are 200,000 square feet at 680 Folsom, 230,000 square feet at 7 Times Square, where we own 55% and 230,000 square feet at Carnegie Center, and they all occur in the first half of the year.A few comments on WeWork. We are actively engaged in lease modification discussions at our 4 units, Dock 72 in Brooklyn and our 3 sites in San Francisco. Our occupancy expectations assume we reach agreements that result in a smaller overall footprint and a reduction to the $33 million of rent they are currently paying. It is the obvious that we work emerges from bankruptcy as an operating business that is positioned for success. Mike will discuss the impacts in his same-store property performance for 2024. In '23, the U.S. (inaudible) markets experienced negative leasing absorption. This included the BXP coastal cities as well as the major Sunbelt and Midwest markets, basically everywhere.How are we thinking about the broad market for '24? If you look at the most recent labor statistics, while the U.S. added 216,000 jobs in December, only 5% were categorized as professional and business services, a.k.a. true office using jobs. The pace of job reductions related to the slowdown in the business economy has slowed, but we continue to see employee layoff announcements across a wide variety of industries, particularly technology.The U.S. economy may not enter a technical recession, but no one should assume that the soft landing is going to stimulate a pickup in office-using employment. Operating in this macro environment, it's hard to envision any dramatic pickup in market leasing absorption in '24.We think overall earnings growth for our clients and potential clients will improve and are optimistic it will lead to employment and space additions just not right away. However, we're not counting on a market recovery to maintain BXP's occupancy. Our leasing, construction and property management teams will lean in on our operating prowess to gain new clients and market share, as clients choose premier properties that are in sound financial conditions for their workplaces. This is how we release known explorations and cover vacant space.The bifurcation of client demand between the East Coast and the West Coast continues to be very wide. San Francisco, West L.A. and Seattle are dependent on technology employers. Traditional technology demand growth continues to be weak and more times than not, renewing technology clients are reducing their lease premises.Snap is a case in point. We were successful in executing a forward-starting 10-year lease extension commencing in '26 for 467,000 square feet. However, the transaction does include an early termination of 140,000 square feet at 12/31 24. We can't require clients to lease more space, but we can meet their workplace needs.The leasing excitement on the West Coast in '23 was all about growth from AI organizations in the city of San Francisco, where we saw over 1 million square feet of positive absorption from the industry in the San Francisco CBD in '23. There have been billions of dollars of recent investment in this growing ecosystem, and there are additional clients in the market, but let's acknowledge that these other AI organizations are predominantly seed or early round funded entities, and not at the same scale as an open AI or an anthropic. Their leasing is focused on small footprint built opportunities that are available at significantly discounted terms relative to rents being achieved in Premier. However, all demand is good demand in San Francisco if it translates into absorption. The Seattle CBD continues to have very little active demand other than lease exploration-driven exploration. Our vacancy in Seattle increased by about 100,000 square feet in the second half of '23, due to WeWorks termination, as well as the give back of a floor from a technology company as part of a 5-floor lease extension at Madison Center. Again, technology company, staying with us in our portfolio, but reducing some space. The entertainment industry, union contract settlements are clearly a positive for West L.A., but there continues to be pressure from streaming profitability, industry consolidation and job reduction in the gaming and media space that is impacting overall demand growth.The concentration of the strongest user demand, which will be the source of occupancy pickup, is still broadly speaking, asset managers, including private equity, venture hedge funds and specialized fund managers and their financial and legal advisers. These organizations are the heart and soul of our New York City activity and are an important sector of the Boston and San Francisco CBD demand as well. In some instances, these clients are growing their teams and capital under management, but in many cases, or in all cases, they want to occupy premier workplaces. To illustrate the point, during the quarter, we completed a 25,000 square feet expansion for an investment bank in Manhattan, a 17,000 square foot lease with a foreign bank that's relocating to one of our other properties in Manhattan, a 10,000 square foot lease with a venture capital firm that's relocating to Embarcadero Center, a 30,000 square foot renewal with a private equity firm at Embarcadero Center, a 74,000 square foot renewal with a law firm in Embarcadero Center and a 15,000 square foot renewal with a long-only manager in Boston. This is where the demand is going to come from.Our strongest activity remains in our Midtown Manhattan portfolio, the Back Bay of Boston, the urban cores of Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia and our Embarcadero Center assets in San Francisco. This quarter, we executed leases of about 74 transactions. We signed 37 lease renewals, 37 leases with new tenants. There were 8 contractions and 9 expansions among our existing clients, with a net reduction of about 100,000 square feet across those 17 transactions. If you exclude Snap, the number is actually a positive 40,000 square feet. The bulk of the transactions were on the West Coast and the majority of the expansions were in New York City. Total leasing volume this quarter was led by New York at 567,000 square feet, then 468,000 in L.A., 198,000 in San Francisco, 153,000 in Boston and 140,000 square feet in the greater Washington, DC area.I would highlight 2 leases that were executed this quarter. First, the Pratt Institute entered into a long-term lease for 63,000 square feet at Dock 72, a real accomplishment for the New York team and DoorDash executed 115,000 square foot lease, including 57,000 square feet of expansion at 200 Fifth Avenue, again, in Manhattan. The mark-to-market of the leases that commenced this quarter, meaning they hit our revenue, was flat as reported in our supplemental. The overall mark-to-market of the starting cash rents on leases executed this quarter, relative to the previous in-place cash rents was down 1.8%. The starting cash rents on leases we signed this quarter on second-generation space were up 7.5% in Boston, flat in New York, down 15% in D.C. and overall on the West Coast down 3%, but the San Francisco CBD was still up 9%.At the end of the quarter, we had signed leases that had yet to commence on our in-service vacancy, totaling approximately 750,000 square feet, with 625,000 square feet anticipated to commence in '24.Our pipeline of active leases under negotiation sits at just under 1 million square feet today. We have only one transaction currently in negotiation over 70,000 square feet. Comparing this to last quarter, we were at 1.2 million square feet of active discussions at the same time and included the 467,000 square foot Snap deal. We've seen an uptick in the number of active deals, but the size is smaller.For modeling purposes, our 2024 leasing activity is anticipated to be about 3.5 million square feet. As of January 1, 2022, so going back 2 years, our total expirations for '24 totaled 3.5 million square feet. On January 1, 2024, we have 2.7 million square feet of current expected expirations. If we renew 25% of the remaining 2024 expirations or 675,000 square feet, it means we will have renewed about 43% of our expiring square footage, which is sort of in line with our historical averages. We have executed leases on 625,000 square feet of vacant space commencing in '24. So effectively, we need about 1.4 million square feet of leases that we have yet to execute on 2024 vacant space to have a rent commencement during the year to maintain a flat occupancy. That's what is built into the model and into Mike's same-store.As we look forward into the year 2024, we expect to have sticky occupancy defined as 20 basis points plus to minus 120 basis points negative at the year, and that also factors in some tenant defaults in addition to contractual expirations.During the year, we will have property additions and subtractions to the portfolio. These are not included in the current portfolio occupancy guidance. As an example, in the fourth quarter of '24, the 2 Waltham Life Science developments will join the in-service portfolio. Their 32% leased and include 300,000 square feet of vacant space that will hit the reported vacancy, that's not part of our projections. We're just looking at our intra-service portfolio as of today.And as long as we're on the topic of life science leasing, new life science activity across our 2 markets as well as our entire portfolio, continues to be light. During the quarter, we actually had 137,000 square foot known exploration of a life science lease in our Waltham portfolio, which impacted our sequential occupancy and there were no new leases signed in South San Francisco at 651 Gateway.In Waltham, we are seeing some tour activity and have made some proposals, but potential clients don't feel a sense of urgency to make a quick decision.Before Mike discusses our 2024 guidance, I want to make one additional comment around the cost of potential new developments that Owen described. We are seeing more competitive pricing in tenant improvement projects. We've not experienced deflation in material prices or labor, but it's true that there is less work, and we believe that this has resulted in lower pricing from the various subcontractors, who want to maintain a certain size of business.As we think about new base building construction costs, we're hopeful that escalation is no longer part of the conversation and that the same pressures will result in bids that allow us to consider moving forward.However, there are lots of infrastructure projects as well as institutional construction that is filling a portion of the void from lower commercial construction in our markets.Capital costs still haven't received. Construction financing requires a significant capital charge for lenders and obviously results in a higher margin on top of the underlying SOFR. Everyone has a view on the timing and depth of Fed Red rate cuts, but if [Silver] goes to 4%, construction financing, if you can arrange it, it's still going to be very expensive and a significant drag on new construction starts.Current market rents and concessions associated with available existing space don't support office -- new office development. To a potential client that requests a proposal for new construction understands it will involve appropriate lease economics to justify the new capital requirements.So Mike, it's time to talk about the quarter and guidance for '24."", 'Michael E. LaBelle', ""Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. So this morning, I plan to cover the details of the fourth quarter and our full year 2023 performance, but I'm going to spend most of our time describing our 2024 initial earnings guidance that was included in our press release, with additional details in our supplemental financial package.So for 2023, we reported full year FFO of $7.28 per share and that was $0.02 per share of the midpoint of our guidance range provided last quarter and $0.01 above Street consensus.Owen described the strong 1.5 million square feet of leasing activity in the quarter, and included in this is 270,000 square feet within our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio, where we generate leasing commissions that exceeded our budget by $0.02 per share.We also outperformed our guidance for the quarter with $0.02 per share of lower net interest expense. There were 2 real reasons for that. Last quarter, we announced the closing of our $600 million 5-year floating rate mortgage on 3 of our Cambridge buildings. When interest rates rallied in December, we opportunistically hedged this financing to fix the rate at 6% for the term. This reduced our interest rate by 160 basis points, contributing to lower interest expense in the quarter. Additionally, the closing of the sale of a 45% interest in 300 Binney Street raised $213 million of equity. That transaction closed earlier than we expected, so the interest earned on the cash represents an increase to our net interest guidance.These 2 items were offset by about $0.02 per share of onetime unbudgeted transaction expenses related to the forming of the joint venture for 290 and 300 Binney Street as well as slightly higher G&A costs in the quarter.Our portfolio NOI performed in line with our expectations, though we did experience a shift from the same property income bucket to termination income. We booked $10 million of termination income in the quarter, which was $7 million higher than our assumption, primarily from WeWork terminating its lease for 2 floors in Madison Center in Seattle.Our practice is to exclude termination income from our same property results. So the impact caused our same-property growth to be slightly negative for the quarter. If you exclude the impact of the termination income, our same-property performance actually would have been roughly flat. So with that, I'm going to turn to our 2024 guidance. On a high level, our 2024 guidance can be summarized as follows. We project growth from the delivery of development and the acquisitions of our partners share in Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue, a slight decrease in our same-property portfolio NOI compared to 2023, higher net interest expense due to the persistency of the current high interest rate environment and lower development and management services fee income.I'm going to start with the impact of the acquisitions of our partner's interest in Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue that Owen described. 360 Park is still in development, so that transaction has limited impact on 2024 FFO. There are a lot of moving pieces with these transactions from an income and balance sheet perspective, so bear with me for a moment. Including the impact of the incremental debt acquired as well as the loss of fee income earned from our former partners, we project these acquisitions are highly accretive, adding approximately $25 million or $0.14 per share to our 2024 FFO.Noncash components represent about 50% of the incremental FFO pickup and are derived from straight lining the leases and fair valuing the debt and the ground lease at Santa Monica Business Park.If we break that down into the categories for our guidance assumptions, the incremental property NOI is approximately $0.22 per share, and that's offset by the additional interest expense of $0.05 per share and the loss of fee income of $0.03 per share.We will now be consolidating the results from these properties. So starting in 2024, you will see the increase in our consolidated NOI and interest expense and a decrease in FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures and fee income. Also impacting 2024 is the disposition of Metropolitan Square in Washington, D.C. that we transacted last year. Inclusive of interest expense, the transaction is neutral to our 2024 FFO. But we do expect a reduction in property NOI of $0.03 per share, that's offset by a comparable $0.03 per share reduction in interest expense.Turning to development activity. Our development activity includes $550 million of investments that delivered in 2023 and will contribute incremental growth for a full year in 2024. These include 2100 Penn, 140 Kendrick Street and 751 Gateway that are in aggregate 97% leased. We have an additional $665 million in developments that are projected to deliver in the near term that we expect will commence revenue in 2024, but be much more meaningful to our growth in 2025 as they complete their lease-up.In aggregate, we expect our developments to contribute an incremental $35 million to $42 million in 2024 or $0.20 to $0.24 per share. Turning to the same property portfolio. Doug spent time describing our occupancy outlook and the impact of the uncertain economic environment that our clients are dealing with. Most continue to be very cautious around new investments, including space, and our leasing projections reflect this conservatism. We still expect to have a productive leasing year. And as Doug described, we have a large backlog of signed leases and leases and negotiation that will go into occupancy in 2024. We expect an occupancy range for our in-service portfolio of 87.2% to 88.6%. Overall, our assumption for 2024 same-property NOI growth from 2023 is negative 1% to negative 3%. As Doug mentioned, we're in discussions with WeWork on modifications for the remaining 4 leases. Our guidance assumes -- our guidance includes assumptions for these modifications that comprise 45 basis points of the decrease in our projected same-property NOI performance.As you all should expect, our interest expense will be higher in 2024 with the continued high interest rate environment. We expect floating rates will start to drop in the back half of the year and are modeling 75 basis points of Fed cuts, which is more conservative than the current forward SOFR curve. Currently, floating rate debt is only 5% of our total debt, is comprised of $730 million of mortgages, and we have a $1.2 billion term loan that's currently fixed and the interest rate swap expires in May of 2024.Our liquidity is very strong. We have current cash balances of $1.5 billion and our entire $1.8 billion line of credit is available. We will be using approximately $700 million of cash to redeem our maturing 3.8% $700 million unsecured bond that expires tomorrow. Other than that, we have no meaningful 2024 debt maturities without extension provisions, so we're not projecting significant changes in our debt profile. Our only external funding need is approximately $600 million of development spend in 2024 that will be funded with available cash. The majority of the increase in interest expense is coming from our 2023 refinancing activity, resulting in a roll up to market interest rates and the consolidation of the mortgage threat for Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue.And lastly, as I mentioned last quarter, our average cash balance will be less in 2024 than it was in 2023, and we expect approximately $30 million of lower interest income. So overall, we're projecting net interest expense of $570 million to $590 million in 2024. We expect consolidated net interest expense to be higher by $72 million at the midpoint, inclusive of the drop in interest income I mentioned. With the consolidation of SMBP and 901 New York Avenue, the interest expense and our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio is expected to be $18 million lower. So this results in a projected increase from year-to-year in total interest expense, including our joint ventures of $54 million or $0.31 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range over 2023. Additionally, the consolidation of Santa Monica Business Park requires us to fair value the above-market ground lease, we project a $10 million positive noncash impact to FFO from this in 2024.The last item I would like to cover is our fee income projection. We have or will be delivering several joint venture development projects, including our Gateway joint ventures, 360 [Park] and the Skymark Residential Development. With the delivery of these projects, our development fees are expected to be lower by about $5 million in 2024. Also, we're no longer receiving fees of about $5 million from Santa Monica and 901 New York Avenue, now that they are wholly owned. So our guidance for fee income is lower and is now $25 million to $28 million in 2024.So if you aggregate all of these assumptions, we're providing an initial 2024 FFO guidance range of $7 to $7.20 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, that's $0.18 per share lower than our 2023 reported FFO. The difference is comprised of increases of $0.19 of incremental NOI from acquisitions and dispositions, $0.22 from our developments, $0.02 of lower G&A expense, offset by $0.26 of higher interest and fair value ground lease amortization, $0.21 of lower contribution from same-property NOI, $0.08 of lower fee income and $0.06 of lower termination income.At the midpoint, our 2024 FFO results in a modest 2.5% decline from 2023. So despite the economic headwinds, we continue to gain market share with our leasing and operating prowess and premier workplace portfolio, demonstrating relative stability in times of negative absorption.We're optimistic that the interest rate environment will settle at a lower level, providing more confidence in the economy. We're also successfully executing on accretive new investments and continue to focus on additional opportunities to grow our earnings and create shareholder value.That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line for questions?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And I show our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""I appreciate all the detail. I guess, Doug, I wanted to maybe circle back on the 1.4 million that you talked about. I think that's kind of the effectively the new leasing number that you need to hit this year. And I think you said you've got some things in the pipeline. But how do we think about that number at unfolding over the course of the year? And I guess, at what point of the year do those leases need to be signed in order to take effect to hit the occupancy target that you're looking for this year?"", 'Douglas T. Linde', 'So that\'s, unfortunately, the technical question that keeps everybody up at night here at BXP, which is what will the actual condition of the space fee that we\'re leasing and what will our requirements be to either modify or change the space relative to simply handing the space over to the tenant? And I wish I could give you a precise answer to that, Steve.Right now, of the -- just over 1 million square feet of space that we are currently under negotiation with, about 500,000 of that is covering what I would refer to as pure vacancy. And I think there is a good probability that 50-plus percent of that will be in place from a revenue perspective in 2024 -- but it\'s -- that\'s the really hard question for us to gauge, which is, I\'m comfortable that we\'re going to get the leasing done and that when we are also showing our ""occupancy, "" including signed leases, that it will illustrate that we have had a very successful year from a leasing perspective.It\'s really hard to know when that revenue is going to hit. And so that\'s the variable that we can\'t control because it\'s really a question of how the lease comes together. And all of that is embroiled into Mike\'s same-store number. So that\'s why I think, to be fair, we are being, I think, conservative but they\'re conservative, not trying to -- we\'re not standing backing anything here because we just don\'t know.', 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.', 'John P. Kim', 'On your joint venture acquisitions, 2 of them were centered around major lease extensions. Was that timing related to your partners exit, because they no longer wanted to fund the future CapEx? Or did the signing of those leases really provide valuations for your partners to exit? And what does this mean for your other assets that you co-own with [CPPIB] and your other selling target?', 'Owen David Thomas', ""Yes. Yes, as I said in my remarks, the lease extensions did spark the acquisitions that we made. And it's for the reasons that you outlined. So with each of these extensions came a capital requirement for tenant work, leasing commissions and, in some cases, building upgrades. And the 2 partners had a shift in strategy to disinvest or reallocate away from office. And that basically sparked the acquisitions.The other thing I would point out, other assets had future capital requirements as well. So in the case of Santa Monica Business Park, we have the Snap renewal, but also we have a fee purchase option coming up in 2028. That could -- if we elect to purchase the fee, that will have a capital requirement.And those 360 Park Avenue South, there was not an anchor lease renewal because that project is under redevelopment. It's in the middle of the redevelopment. So the partner basically sold out their position in the middle of funding that development. So it also had a future funding requirements. So those are really the drivers."", 'Douglas T. Linde', ""Yes. And John, I would just say the following, which is there are institutional investors who have just had a perspective that at this moment in time, investing additional capital in our sector is not what they want to do, relative to their portfolios. We obviously have a very different perspective on the long-term value that's going to be created by doing these transactions or we wouldn't be doing them. So we're excited about the lease that we signed with Snap. We're excited about the lease we signed with Finnegan Henderson. And we're excited about what that means for the long-term value of these properties. And it was the disconnect between what they wanted to do and what we wanted to do that really created the opportunity from our perspective to deploy capital in a very accretive way. And we're looking for other opportunities in our portfolio and away from our portfolio, where these types of disconnects between the current owner and what our perspective is they're different."", 'Owen David Thomas', ""Yes. And just lastly, John, to the second question that you asked, never say never. There might be other opportunities to acquire interest in properties that we own, but I certainly don't think the volume would be anything like what we experienced in the last quarter.For example, today, our largest joint venture partner is Norges. And in the last quarter, they actually increased their number of joint ventures with us because we did these 2 major JVs in Cambridge. And obviously, they have a different strategy from the JV partners that we acquired interest from. So it could be more, but I don't think it will be anything close to the volume that we experienced last quarter."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""And first, Bob Pester, congrats on retirement. I guess now we can all look for Rod's steady hand.Just, Owen, and Doug, just I guess a 2-parter following up on John Kim's questions. One, obviously, is the debt side of the equation, looking what your expectations are for potential debt resolution, where Boston may be able to pay off debt at cents on the dollar and two.As you look at these JV buyouts, is it purely that the partners, whether the existing or potential ones in the future, just don't want to put in capital or is it that they view the investment of that capital to be highly risky, whereas you guys seem quite confident in your returns? And just trying to understand if it's a capital issue that your partners just want to know more versus a risk of investment decision?"", 'Owen David Thomas', ""Yes. I think the -- Alex, to answer your question on the debt side, Mike should answer. But in general, as you know, we primarily finance with unsecured financing, and we have great access to that market and have been accessing it and we think it's very attractive. And in most cases, we've been able to extend or refinance existing mortgages that we have on our joint ventures.Look, I think in terms of the answer to your question, the JV partners would have to answer it in terms of how they thought about the returns that they were forecasting from the extensions that we committed to. But when we do our own math, and we shared some of it with you on this call, we think it's very attractive and it's very accretive to our company, and we think it makes a lot of sense.So our suspicion, as a result, is that these decisions that they made were more related to a change in strategy as opposed to a lack of enthusiasm for the return.I'd also just make an additional point on this. These are 2 different partners, and they come from a little bit different position. So the partner on 901 has been a long-term investor in that project, and they have been in it, and they have made a good return and has been very successful for them. So maybe it was a change in strategy, but it also might have been, look, we've been in this for a very long period of time. We've done fine. Maybe this would be a good time to exit.I think on the partner on the other 2 deals, Santa Monica Business Park and 360, definitely, they were newer to the JVs, and I think that clearly was more of a change in strategy."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.', 'Nicholas Philip Yulico', ""I was hoping to just get a little bit more feel for the decision to reinvest in Santa Monica Business Park. Why you think it's still an attractive long-term opportunity?And secondly, if you could just give us any feel for -- in terms of the Snap renewal, how the mark-to-market worked on that plus the level of TIs and free rent if you had to give there?"", 'Owen David Thomas', ""Yes. So I'll turn it over to Mike for the second question. But in terms of the first question, I mentioned the yield that we bought this and the per foot that we bought the asset on a fee simple basis, we think that's very attractive pricing. We were able to derisk the asset materially through the extension of the anchor tenant, which leases 400-plus thousand square feet of the 1.2 million square feet.And also, we think that Santa Monica Business Park is a very interesting redevelopment opportunity for our company, and we're in the process of commencing that redevelopment process. And we think over a long period of time, it's going to be a very accretive asset to our company. So we are excited about the asset."", 'Douglas T. Linde', ""Yes. And Nick, this is Doug. On your answer to the other question. Without -- we're not going to get into the specifics of a particular tenants economics.As I said in my remarks, our West Coast leases that were signed this quarter -- executed this quarter was down 3%, but San Francisco was up 9%. So you can go through the statistics and sort of decide yourself how you think that might have played out.And relative to transaction costs in free rent, it was actually a very low transaction costs and low free rent early renewals. So those economics were built into the lease rate."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.', 'Anthony Paolone', ""You talked about playing offense and it sounds like you'll use some third-party capital as you've done in the past. But just for BXP's portion of deals and playing offense, where do you think we see capital come from for you all?"", 'Owen David Thomas', ""Well, as you said, as I mentioned in my remarks, I do think there will be opportunities that will present themselves for the company this coming year. And as you said, we will -- the joint venture partner more than likely using third-party capital, and we will be using our balance sheet to fund our joint venture interest in whatever we come up with. But it's -- again, we are receiving inquiries. We are looking at things, but we're not, I would say, advanced in anything at this time. But if we look at what we think will happen in 2024 versus illiquidity in the market in 2023, I think activity will be greater this coming year."", 'Michael E. LaBelle', ""And I would just add that a lot of what we're looking at is doing things more on a capital-light basis, and taking a lower percentage interest percentage potentially or entering assets in a different way and kind of similar to these transactions that we did, and this didn't require a lot of incremental capital.We took on a little bit, obviously, their share of the debt, but the overall impact on our leverage was very, very small with these transactions. And in fact, we've kind of delevered overall because we brought in the equity from the Cambridge transaction. Overall, we deleveraged.We're -- we don't expect that we're going to increase our leverage significantly. And our goal is to kind of maintain it in a range that is pretty close to where we are. So I think that when we think about investments, we keep that in mind."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', ""We've talked a little bit about San Francisco, and there's some clear differences in the markets. Do you think we're kind of hitting the bottom in these tech markets that are lagging in their portfolio? And just any visibility from the demand from AI or other sources that are providing some near-term excitement for a rebound in San Francisco and Seattle?"", 'Douglas T. Linde', 'I would say, Michael, that the technology demand on the West Coast is lower than we would like it to be, largely because there have been a significant amount of technology layoffs over the past, call it, 12 to 18 months, and they\'re still happening.Clearly, they\'re happening at a much lower rate and they\'re on the margin. So I would tell you that I think we\'ve been sort of in the ""bottom"" for a period of time. And I don\'t look at the world and say that there\'s another ""(inaudible),"" I think we\'re just sort of in a portion of time where there\'s just no interest in growth from a real estate space perspective for technology companies.I believe that will change. The fourth quarter and the third quarter of 2023 in San Francisco for AI was a great quarter, and we had 2 really interesting transactions occur, which we\'ve described previously. There was 1 million square feet of positive absorption. I\'m not smart enough to know if those 2 tenants may double or triple or quadruple over the next 2 to 3 years. I also don\'t know whether or not there are going to be other AI companies that are either BC or seed invested with [angle] investing that are going to explode.I\'m hopeful that those types of things will happen. And from our perspective, that will all be to the good for the West Coast and for the city of San Francisco. 2024 is not going to be that year in terms of, in our view, space absorption.', 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""It's actually Nick Joseph here with Michael.Owen and Doug, you guys have touched on the opportunities expected this year and with some institutional owners, maybe change in strategy or lowering exposure. I guess on the other side, are you seeing more competition for some of these potential deals? Are you seeing people actually looking either distressed opportunities or other opportunistic opportunities looking to actually add exposure to office? And then how are you thinking about actually underwriting the deals, just given the current environment?"", 'Owen David Thomas', ""Yes. So Nick. So there have been more office transactions in the fourth quarter. In my remarks, I gave some stats, and it was kind of interesting to me the percentage of the commercial real estate transactions that are going on from office increased materially in the fourth quarter to the third.So what's happening? I think there are more distressed players that are out there, buying assets at very low per square foot prices. Some of these assets are challenged physically, most of them are not very well leased. And I think those buyers are family offices, for example, they're smaller deals that don't need leverage. Because again, getting a secured mortgage for an office building is virtually impossible. And I think these buyers are just saying, look at this per square foot price, we think the market will ultimately recover, and we're in at a good basis.So I think that's the kind of market that's out there. Those aren't the kind of deals that we want to do. I mean we're looking for premier workplaces. We're looking for assets. They may not be fully leased. Maybe there are some challenges with it or an asset that we can make a premier workplace, and they're going to be larger and they're going to probably require funding from the financing market in some way. And I think there's much less competition for anything like that. And I think, hence, that's BXP's opportunity."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.', 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Hopefully, you can hear me. Just one, 2-parter, one on the same-store NOI guidance of down 2%. Just hoping a little bit more color. You talked about WeWork being a 45 basis point headwind. Just could you talk through maybe what some of the larger expirations that you're expecting in the first half the impact will be and what you're assuming at the top and bottom end of the guidance range?And the second part, if I could sneak it in, is just on the life science market, as you sit here today versus 3 to 6 months ago, can you just characterize what the leasing activity is like for the larger versus the sort of mid and smaller tenants?"", 'Michael E. LaBelle', ""So I'll start with that on the same-store question, which is really related to kind of the trends in our occupancy that we expect. So we gave the range of that. And our anticipation is the first half of the year has some of these larger expirations, there's one in New York City. There's one in (inaudible) Center and then there's one in San Francisco, and Doug kind of described how big they were.And then the leasing that we have signed that are going into vacant space is more spread across. So my expectation is that you're going to see occupancy decline a little bit in the first couple of quarters, and then it's going to build back up through the year. And that's what's built kind of into our guidance ranges. And then obviously, our boundaries are kind of the upper and lower boundaries of what that year-end occupancy range that we provided is that Doug talked about. So that's kind of how we build that range. And I think that pretty much answers your question, Nick."", 'Douglas T. Linde', 'Yes. And let me add on Rod deal go first on life science activity in the San Francisco -- South San Francisco, North Peninsula market and then Bryan can talk about life science activity in our Waltham portfolio, which is where obviously where our availability is.Rod, do you want to start?', 'Rodney C. Diehl', ""I would just say that relative to 6 months ago, at least in the Bay Area, I would say the life science demand is about what it had been, which is that it's not with the larger users. There have been some smaller tenants. That's how we were able to land the 3 deals at our 651 Gateway project. Those are single-floor tenants roughly 22,000 each.So in that section of the demand, we're still seeing a little bit of activity, but not so much on the larger groups. So relative to 6 months ago, I think it's probably about the same."", 'Bryan J. Koop', ""Boston, this is Bryan Koop. It really reflects the same thing. The second half of last year was far different than the first, and activity picked up on life science tours. But let's say, from summer beginning, smaller users out there still questioning, is it time to make a commitment or not? A lot of questions about their funding, et cetera.And then fourth quarter, we did see a couple of, let's say, the life science titans come out and emerge. And they were all caught let's say, potential clients that are in the market already in Cambridge that were, let's say, looking, sourcing the Waltham market for what could be available. In general, we just had a summary with Doug and Owen yesterday about last year's performance. And we were quite surprised. We have 360 tours last year. So you're averaging 7 a week, which was surprising, given how dismal the attitude about office was.2 comments. One is that the clients are spending far more time with us and aggressively looking for what their strategy is going forward. And we have also seen verification of possible spoke plays, where you have a large headquarters in the CBD district and then looking for a spoke location further closer to the suburbs to people's homes.

Google announced last night meaningful office optimization charges, 1.2 billion in the quarter. So given your 2.8% exposure to the tenant, will this impact any of your properties?

We have -- Google is in only one asset of ours, which is in our Cambridge portfolio and they're in there for a long, long time, and they're actively using their space and talking to us about increasing parking needs and things like that. So we have no sense that there's any change in their portfolio composition at least with us at BXP.I would say most of our defaults have been in the life science and they've been in the sort of start-up tech world, and we have one in Waltham, that's probably going to occur and we have 2 or 3 that occurred in the latter parts of 2023 on the West Coast, one CBD and 2 in the suburban market, and they're all sort of in this 20,000 to 25,000 square feet of piece, and they're just part of the -- what's going on in the economy with regards to capital formation, where VCs want to put their money, where they don't want to put their money, whether technologies are successfully getting companies to the point where they can raise additional capital again and we have some exposure to that, but it's not significant."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America.', 'Jing Xian Tan Bonnel', 'On the 6 projects that are scheduled to be stabilized in 2025 and have started or are starting initial occupancy this year, how far along are the leasing prospects on those buildings?

Those 2 are coming online in '24 in terms of when they're going to be in service. And we need to find some clients to lease those buildings in order for them to be stabilized in 2025.At 651 Gateway, it's a similar conversation, in that we've started doing leasing. We will be through 12 months of the lease-up in early 2025, and we need to do more leasing in order to get that one going in the 360 Park Avenue South, which -- where the building construction is complete and Hilary and her team in New York are aggressively pursuing anybody who wants premier space in the Midtown South market, where we've done one lease, and we have another lease that we're close to having a letter of intent on for a floor plus.

And that one also we need to do additional leasing in order for it to be stabilized in 2025.The rest of the -- I believe the rest of the stuff is residential, and that's obviously a question of when those buildings start and how long the ramp-up is in terms of turning over the units and I think when Skymark opens, which is the Reston property in the third quarter of 2024, we have probably a 15- to 18-month lease-up. (inaudible) you can correct me if I'm wrong, in or for that one to be stabilized."", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""No, those are both correct. And that also has, as you know, 75,000 square feet of office and then some ancillary retail. And we're working on a couple of deals for the retail space. And we've got, I would say, a real prospect for about half of the office space that we're speaking to, but not at LOI stage with at this point in time."", 'Michael E. LaBelle', ""So Camille, that was really in my notes, I kind of described that the deliveries in '24 are these deliveries we're talking about. And we don't expect '24 to have a really significant impact from those, but we do expect to have some leasing momentum in '24, with income starting in '25. So our expectation is that that's when we will start to see more revenue come from these buildings."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo.', 'Blaine Matthew Heck', ""So it seems like we're still seeing the flight to quality trend play out with most net absorption and leasing activity taking place at high-quality buildings with high rents. But recent media reports have tried to kind of poke holes and even the top of the office market. So just wanted to get your thoughts on whether anything has changed with respect to leasing activity or rents at the top of the market and whether you've noticed that tenants have maybe become more cost conscious and less likely to lease at those highest quality spaces?"", 'Owen David Thomas', ""I would tell you -- I didn't go through it this quarter because we had so much other stuff to go through. But the premier workplace data that I generally provide on this call shows accelerating distancing between premier workplaces and the rest of the market from a vacancy, net absorption and rental perspective. So at least at a high level, the trend to premier workplace continues to run unabated."", 'Douglas T. Linde', ""And I would tell you that the most activity that we are having on a building-by-building basis is, in fact, in our CBD most premier assets. And in no case, are we seeing changes in the economics of what the market or we are asking for and ultimately achieving in those client conversations.I'm not sure where that information that was in the article in the Wall Street Journal came from, but it's just -- and I'll let Hilary describe what's going on in Manhattan in terms of our activity level, which I think is sort of the poster trial for Premier. And she can sort of give you a perspective on why I think that article is just not -- it doesn't hold water for us."", 'Hilary J. Spann', ""Thanks, Doug. Yes. So we have seen consistently since, at least 2019, gains in occupancy in Midtown Manhattan for Premier workplace, with corresponding declines in occupancy for non-Premier workplaces. And the same is true in terms of rental rate gains for Premier Workplaces in Midtown Manhattan.So while you might expect, given the weakness in some of the overall office statistics to sort of affect the Premier Workplace, in fact, the opposite is true. And at present, the vacancy rate for Premier Workplaces is hovering just around 10%, which we consider stabilization levels for Midtown Manhattan.And although the capital markets environments are not constructive for new development, that is generally the point in the market at which you would start to see people interested in building new products.So if you think about the availability of high-quality space in Midtown, there are only 3 available spaces in the Park Avenue submarket of 250,000 square feet or greater. One of them has a lease out on it. So if you are a tenant of size and you're looking for premier space in Midtown, it simply is very, very hard to find and getting harder. And that drives pricing, obviously. So we feel very, very good about our Midtown portfolio. And we think that rents will continue to improve across the board for Premier Workplace in New York."", 'Douglas T. Linde', ""And then just -- Jake, you might comment on the phenomenon you're seeing at the high end -- in the premier buildings where, I guess, what we would refer to in Washington, D.C. as the trophy buildings in terms of both the demand and the economics there."", 'Jake J. Stroman', ""Sure. I will just sort of tack on to what Hilary had noted in Washington, D.C. We continue to see a significant sort of material outperformance for trophy class assets and repositioned assets in our market. There's an incredible amount of leasing velocity that we see at those assets, relative to what we see across the rest of the market being commodity space. So we've achieved a lot of leasing success in a lot of our premier assets in downtown Washington and continue to see a lot of traffic."", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""We're seeing the same thing in Boston. And as noted in our discussions internally this last week, for our Boston portfolio, we're at 4.4% vacancy and Cambridge is 2.5%, which is just phenomenal.We are seeing -- I wouldn't say that this is outstanding trend, but we are seeing users that normally would not be in our office building, where they want more square footage in, let's say, a Class B or C building, looking to us for reaching up with smaller square footage just used more efficiently."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Upal Rana from KeyBanc.', 'Upal Dhananjay Rana', 'The D.C. market seems to be a bright spot, given the JV acquisition of 901 and the lease extension as well as the increase in occupancy there. Do you see the strength that is sustainable? Or could you provide your thoughts on the D.C. market in general?', 'Douglas T. Linde', ""So I would tell you that the D.C. market is the most -- one of the most interesting markets from our perspective in the sense that there are more, what I would refer to as over finance buildings with institutional owners that are no longer interested in providing capital to those assets, which is manifesting itself in a inability for lease transactions to occur in those transactions.And Jake and his team are, I would say, highlighting our financial stability and the things that we are doing in our buildings. And there is no question that the lease transaction that he just pulled off with Finnegan Henderson was a direct result of the lack of opportunities for a large tenant to go to other existing buildings, the inability of any new construction to commence and BXP's ability to both provide TI capital as well as figure out a way to reposition that building to be as close to a brand-new trophy building as you possibly can have.And Jake, you might just sort of describe the choices that are out there and how the distress in the market is impacting our ability to transact."", 'Jake J. Stroman', ""Yes, sure. I can just -- Doug, to that point, if we look at 901 New York Avenue as an example, in the last 30 months, we've done 140,000 square feet, plus or minus, of transactions at that asset. And we've had great activity. And I think a lot of that is because we've been incredibly responsive to the clients in the market. And I think people have been responsive to our sponsorship at the asset.So we feel really comfortable with the plus or minus 100,000 square feet of vacancy at the asset, given the repositioning program that we're going to undergo. And so we're really excited because these repositioned assets and investing this new capital into re-amenitizing the ground floor plane of the building and sort of really repositioning the lobby experiences, it really drives the activity of that asset, and it really becomes a new building in the market.And so there are fewer and fewer of those opportunities available in downtown Washington. And ever since news of the transaction that Doug noted was completed, we've seen great activity already and continue to at 901. And it's just representative of the fact that there aren't a lot of great opportunities in Washington, D.C. that exist today for premier office or repositioned office."", 'Michael E. LaBelle', ""The one other thing I would add is the performance of Reston Town Center. I mean again, the majority of our portfolio in the Greater Washington areas and Reston Town Center. And Reston is 94% leased, and we've had positive absorption there. In this past quarter, we did a 60,000 square foot new lease with a technology company coming from another place into Reston Town Center.Again, because it is such high quality kind of a live, work, play kind of place, and these clients really, really value that. So we're outperforming from a rental rate perspective, and we're seeing positive absorption there."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Peter Abramowitz from Jefferies.', 'Peter Dylan Abramowitz', ""I think Owen mentioned there's an early termination option for part of the Snap extension at Santa Monica Business Park. Just curious how that's kind of factoring into your conversations with the lender ahead of the loan maturity in 2025. And wondering just how to think around parameters for pricing as you start to have those conversations?"", 'Douglas T. Linde', ""This is Doug. There is no termination option on the lease that we just signed. As part of the lease, we allowed them to terminate on 140,000 square feet at the end of 2024. The remaining 467,000 square feet is going out for 10 years starting in 2026 to 2036. So Mike can describe any conversations that we've had with the lender, but we're very comfortable with the refinancing opportunity associated with that building and how that will play out, relative to both the new leasing that we hope to do as well as the potential purchase of the ground, which is -- can occur in 2028."", 'Michael E. LaBelle', ""And Peter, the loan is with a syndicate of banks who are relationship banks of ours. It does expire in 2025. And I'm confident that those banks will be supportive of us, and we will likely extend that loan for, I would say, a bridge period that will get us through the purchase of the ground lease. And after the purchase of the ground lease, because it's an above-market ground lease, there will be an improvement to the economics of the asset and we would probably do a longer-term refinancing after that or focus on a portion of the part that might be redeveloped, and then we could split it into a portion that is going to stay as is for a while in a portion where we might do a kind of mixed-use redevelopment."", 'Douglas T. Linde', ""And now that it's effectively a wholly owned joint venture, we have no partner. We don't need to use third-party financing. We can choose to use unsecured financing. So I mean there are lots of (inaudible)."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street.', 'Dylan Robert Burzinski', 'I guess just appreciate the comments on potential acquisition opportunities in the future. But could you just talk about sort of how maybe your co-investment partners are viewing office today and sort of the return threshold needed for them to deploy capital to the sector?', 'Owen David Thomas', ""I think it's a mix. As we've just described some partners that are trying to reallocate away from office. And -- but there are others that are interested, they're intrigued. I think they see the same opportunity that we do.All of these negative sentiment about office is creeping into the premier workplace segment, which doesn't deserve it, given all of the color that we just gave you on this call. And I think there are investors, who have capital that see that and are interested in co-investing with us.And so in terms of pricing, I think it's to be determined. I think it depends a lot on the building, leasing status and what exactly the issues are. There's no doubt that pricing has changed. And we demonstrated what some of those changes are with the deals we did last quarter."", 'Operator', 'And I show our last question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point LLC.', 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', ""I guess following up on the last question a little bit, Owen, maybe I'd love to get your thoughts on cap rates, and what is happening in office? And when could we see, in your opinion, the stabilization of cap rates? It appears that clearly, the Santa Monica deal at a 9% cap rate, that would be probably 200 basis points north of where it was maybe 18, 24 months ago.Maybe talk specifically about your view on what's happening to cap rates in some of your key markets like New York, San Francisco, Boston, D.C. or L.A. And what -- and at what point would you -- where do cap rates need to be for you to actually deploy more capital?"", 'Owen David Thomas', ""Floris, you're asking a very good but unanswerable question, and I'll explain why.We tried. I try every quarter to give all of you comparable market deals. So we all understand together what pricing is. And this quarter, I could not come up with one. The only one was the deal in West L.A., but it had a lease buyout, and I'm not sure it was per se, a comparable deal.We gave you some data on partner buyouts that we did. Each one of those deals have different facts. For example, the Santa Monica deal was an unlevered fee simple cap rate. Well, that's got an assumption in there about Land Valley. So how accurate and how usable is that cap rate, I don't know. But we did just give you 3 cap rates on deals in New York, West L.A. and Washington, D.C. on partners that we bought out. So that is some data.And then lastly, in terms of what would be interesting to us, we pay attention to what is the look through cap rate for BXP and what would be accretive to us. And today, I think that number is around 7.5%. And we need to -- if we're going to do things that need to accrete our earnings. And so we're going to be focused on that, look through cap rate as a guidepost for what we do."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks.', 'Owen David Thomas', ""I can't imagine you all want to hear any more remarks from us. So I thank you for your patience. This is a complicated quarter. We got through a lot of data. And again, thank you for your time and interest in BXP."", 'Operator', ""Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Good day.""]"

Good morning, and welcome to Navient's earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2023. With me today are David Yowan, Navient's CEO; Edward Bramson, Vice Chair of the Navient Board of Directors; and Joe Fisher, Navient's CFO. Navient has a lot to share with you this morning and has posted 2 separate presentations that will be referred to during this call. Both are available on navient.com/investors. We will refer to a strategy update presentation, which you will find posted on our website. Our in-depth review and strategy update discussion may take us past the half hour. Following this update, Joe will discuss the fourth quarter results and outlook for 2024. You will refer to the fourth quarter 2023 presentation, which you will also find posted on navient.com/investors. After the prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. Before we begin, keep in mind, our discussion will contain predictions, expectations, forward-looking statements and other information about our business that is based on management's current expectations as of the date of this presentation. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to those factors in the discussion of them on the company's Form 10-K and other filings to the SEC. During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including core earnings, adjusted tangible equity ratio and various other non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from core earnings. Our GAAP results, description of our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of core earnings to GAAP results can be found beginning on Page 18 of Navient's Fourth Quarter 2023 earnings release, which is posted on our website. Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Dave."", 'David L. Yowan', ""Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call and for your interest in Navient. As you know, the Board and management began an in-depth review of our business a few months ago. It's been a rigorous and comprehensive process. I've asked Ed Bramson, Vice Chair of the Navient Board to join me this morning. Ed and I will describe the steps we're taking, their rationale and objectives and what they mean for Navient. After that, Joe will share our Q4 results and 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. There are 3 actions that we're taking coming out of our in-depth review, outsourcing loan servicing, exploring strategic options for BPS and reshaping our shared service infrastructure and corporate footprint. At a high level and in the near term, these actions are intended to simplify our business, reduce our expense base and increase our financial and operating flexibility. Over the long term, we believe these actions will increase the value shareholders derive from our loan portfolios and the returns we can achieve on our business building investments. Let me turn to Slide 2 of our strategy update. In May 2023, the executive team and the Board launched an in-depth review of our business to ensure we are on the right path for success and value creation. This review has confirmed that changes are necessary for Navient to deliver its full value and potential. Our review included an extensive and intensive analysis of costs. We focus on the size, purpose and allocation of all costs by business unit and shared service activities like IT as well as unallocated costs within our corporate other segment. At the same time, we sought to benchmark and compare our costs of important activities, including loan servicing to the cost of third-party providers. We analyzed our projected in-house servicing costs over the remaining life of our loan portfolio and compared it to third-party costs through a competitive RFP process. Our current costs were found to be comparable to third-party providers. But it was also clear that our in-house cost of service would not continue to be competitive with third-party costs as our legacy portfolio amortizes and our economies of scale begin to disappear. As a result, we've decided to transition to an outsourced servicing model. Once completed, this will create a variable cost structure for the servicing of our student loan portfolios and provide attractive unit economics across a wide range of servicing volume scenarios. Through our competitive process, we selected MOHELA as our servicing partner. MOHELA is a leading provider of student loan servicing for government and commercial enterprises. We are committed to a seamless transition for our customers in a few months' time. Many of our servicing employees are expected to transfer along with this transaction. Now to our second strategic action. Our in-depth review highlighted that a significant part of our cost base in infrastructure is shared between loan servicing and BPS and especially within BPS' government services business. Both businesses involved many similar activities, such as call center operations, payment processing and omnichannel customer interactions, such as telephony or text, among others. Given the earnings multiple, the market assigns to our shares, our BPS businesses do not receive the value assigned to comparable stand-alone businesses. This limits our ability to realize these businesses full potential and value, such as though larger investments in organic or inorganic growth, for example. Therefore, we are exploring strategic options for BPS, including but not limited to divestments with the goal of realizing the full value and potential of these businesses. We've engaged financial and legal advisers to help us with these efforts and we'll provide updates along the way. Pursuing divestments simultaneously with the decision outsource servicing maximizes the potential for shared cost reduction. We expect to be able to identify and more quickly eliminate stranded costs. Third, we intend to reshape our shared services functions and corporate footprint to align with the needs of a more focused, flexible and streamlined company. We've identified opportunities and some of the steps that need to be taken are included in our 2024 outlook. The full scope and timing of these opportunities will depend on the progress of the outsourcing and potential divestiture transactions. These will define any transition services requirements as well as separation and stranded costs. If you look at our 2023 operating expenses, approximately $400 million, which is net of expected outsourced servicing expenses could be eliminated under a scenario in which we had already completed the 3 steps we're announcing today. That scenario would also not include BPS revenue under a full business divestiture scenario. We expect to finalize all 3 actions during 2024. Their implementation is expected to be largely complete over the next 18 to 24 months. With that, let me turn it over to Ed."", 'Edward Bramson', ""Thank you, David. I think one of the things that David has spoken about that we're actually doing are relatively clear. But what we thought might be helpful today is that for the last 8, 9, 10 years, Navient has been in a steady state. You can predict more or less what it's going to do. And starting in 2025, it's going to be steady state again. So in the coming years, sort of transitional and you could think about it as a turnaround here. And the firm that limit invests principally in turnarounds, so we thought it might be helpful to provide some perspective on not just what we're doing, but why we're doing it. And David asked me, I think the word he actually used was delegated me to take you through it from that perspective. So starting on Page 3 you could obviously say, well, why would the Board look at doing this now as opposed to in the future or having done it in the past. And if you look at the first bullet, it basically says that the share price since the spin-off in 2014 has gone down a little bit. It's not the worst you've got to seen. But I think the Board concluded that it's not a tremendous return for 10 years' work. So the question is, what do you do about it? And as David said, the first step was to do a really solid review of costs. And that project, and I've been involved in quite a few of these turnaround situations was one of the best interactions between Board and management that I've ever seen. So this is a unified approach, and I think it's very long down. The basic issue it had to address is if you think about Navient compared to other companies, a very high proportion of our costs are allocated rather than directly attributable. And what that tends to mean in practice is you always spend a lot of time deciding which bucket the costs should go into, which doesn't leave much time to figure out whether you should have them or not. And this study has sort of broken through that and has provided a lot of useful data. Obviously, it helps with what Dave was talking about cost reduction, but it also points you to what to do next with capital allocation or growth or whatever. And what of the one sort of ends up saying is that for a turnaround, this is somewhat unusual situation. The likely cash that's going to be available in the next few years actually is higher in the month than our entire market cap. So a lot of what the strategic plan will ultimately have to be about is how do you use that wisely. So I would like to take you through our thinking on that. If you go to Page 4. The major driver of our financial performance since the spin-off had to be the loans we inherited. We -- at the time of the spin-off of about $135 billion of loans. And the intention was not to replace them. They were intended to run off. The intention was to do other things with them. And so we have made some efforts in that regard. We've actually generated about $9 billion of new loans. But I think over time, and I've gone back and looked at some of the sell-side research, people were probably a little too optimistic about how soon you could start to get to the inflection point when your revenues grew faster than once line. And in reality, as you can see, we've had a runoff of about $90 billion of loans. We've added about $9 billion of new ones. So we might be on track to some inflection points in revenue, but it's not near term. So the inflections to focus on are the ones that David is talking about, which are inflections in earnings or shareholder value. And if you go to Page 5, I think this helps to put in perspective what we're focused on in the short run. The revenues coming down is not really the principal issue on in us. The issue is the operating leverage that creates. And so during the period, as you can see, if you take net interest income, we've had a drop of about $1.1 billion on an annual basis. Our operating expenses have come down by $80 million. There are lots of reasons and background for that, which I won't get into. But whereas the ratio that we're getting here is 15 to 1. Unfortunately, it's a negative ratio, and that's what David assuming it right now. There's a second contributory issue that comes out of this, which we'll come back to a little bit later on, which is as we thought that the revenue inflection is coming fairly soon, has receded, you tend to get a reduction in the PE multiple, and we'll get into what the consequences of that range as the second. And if you go to Page 6. During the period, we did make a lot of investments to brought BPS and brought on is did some other things. The biggest single investment we made was in share repurchases. And as you perhaps know, we have bought back since the spin-off of about 75% of our original shares outstanding. And that program did what it was intended to do, which essentially was to maintain earnings per share. And the data in the table is a little bit messy. There's a difference between GAAP and core. But I think it's fair to say that if you looked at it, it's maintained earnings flat to slightly up. So it achieved what is intended to do. On the other hand, the problem we've had is because of the change in perception of strategy, the multiple has been coming down. So even though the earnings per share are flat to up, because of our decline in multiple, the share price has come down. That's an issue that we need to deal with as well, and we'll talk about that shortly. So with the joint project pre and board management done, what are the immediate priorities. The first one is obviously to get your operating expenses down. And there are 2 elements to that. There's an obvious one, which is that the loan portfolio is, by and large, with one exception, are not designed to be replaced. So every dollar that you spend of overhead on them or other expenses connected with them, just comes out of the value of the portfolio. So our biggest single asset today is the loan portfolio is, the less money you spend collecting when everything else equal the better. I think the more subtle issue is that our major future asset is the businesses we're trying to grow. And in an allocated environment, as the legacy businesses shrink, their allocated costs get reallocated to new businesses, which are the ones you're trying to grow, we've got for them. So they had the effect of smothering that effort. So that needs to be dealt with. And I think the other thing, coming back to the rising cost of equity is this. If you accept that we're going to have a tremendous amount of cash relative to our market cap to either return to investors or invest over the next 2, 3 years, it needs to be disciplined in how you think about it. So think about it this way. If we take $100 of cash and we put it into an investment and the mix a 10% return, that's $10. At our current multiple, that means market value of $70 for the $100 you put in. That's not viable, you can't do that. So you either have to return that money or come up with something better. So we're at easy today, and hopefully, this will change is you need to make about a 15% return on equity to justify doing anything and if you do it sort of a wash. So as that as a background, what I'd like to do on Page 8. As David said and the guys said at the beginning, this is a strategy update, how to think about the strategy, it's not their strategy. But the strategy is going to be driven by what you have to work with. And on this page, we have the major components of the business. So the loan portfolios, we'll cover in the second. The other items we have, we have quite a large amount of unrestricted cash and we have 2 operating segments. We have earnest and we have BPS. And both of those have some interesting aspects to and we'll cover a little bit in a group. If you go to Page 9, this is the loan portfolio. Okay. So the first piece of the portfolio is our loan assets. And I think it's important to explain that on our balance sheet, these are consolidated, which makes it a bit difficult to track what they're really worth. In reality, the -- all the loans that almost on loans that we have are securitized. They reside in trust against which those trusts have incurred some borrowing. So the real economic interest we have in the loan portfolio is what we get from the securitization trust. And that's a combination of future net interest income, servicing fees and the initial equity that we put in that comes back at the end when the trust is liquidated there. So if you take those inflows, the table sort of puts together things that you've seen before, but maybe not in one place. And what it essentially says is that the expected distributions to us from the trusts are about $13 billion. Against that, we financed it in part with unsecured debt, which is a little less than $6 billion. So there's somewhere in the region of $7 billion to come in from those trust over time as we speak. And about half of that looks like it comes in, in the next 5 years. However, it does cost some money to get from there to what shareholders to receive. And so if you want to maximize that value, you need to deal with loan servicing expense, corporate overhead and the interest on our liabilities. We think there are opportunities in all of those areas. And I think Dave is already lining out for you what they're in servicing and corporate overhead. The objective here is to give you a realistic view of what these things are worth. We need to be able to give you all the data which we don't have yet. So hopefully, by the end of the year, we'll be able to line all of that out. David covered the outsourcing. I just want to say briefly on Page 11 what is the environment and what the decision that created it is. When (inaudible) spun off, it had 12 million borrowers, Half of them were serviced for the education department, the other half were our loans. So as you move along, probably 1.23 of the loans were financed for the education department, much larger infrastructure that we require for what we do today. So surprisingly, and this is a real complement to the management team. When you benchmark it, our servicing costs are very competitive today. The problem, as David said, as the base shrinks, they're going to get less competitive. So there is an option to go ahead and invest in a small and more flexible system to deal with that. We think a more desirable option is out towards to somebody who has scale. The expectation, therefore, is not that we're going to save a lot of money on servicing in the short term because we are competitiv, but as the portfolio shrinks, the benefits become very large by making it variable. So if that's the loan portfolio.On Page 12, there's another item on restricted cash. And I think the way to look at this is it's not part of the loan portfolios, but it goes with it. And the reason we have all the cash you see on the chart here is that it's a liquidity buffer for the large loan maturities that we have coming up periodically. And so it's always been there. However, it's not always easy to get this out of the financials, it's unrestricted cash that's available for general corporate purposes and it belongs to the shareholders. And as at the end of '23, that's about $7.50 a share of cash that belongs to the shareholders. In fact, if you look at some other liquid assets that we have in addition to cash, it's more like $10 a share. So if you think about that and if you think about the potential inflows from the loan portfolios, that's why I was saying earlier that even if you don't sell BPS, you're going to be having cash available for distributions or investments that's actually in the next few years, equal to more than our entire market cap. So obviously, the key to the situation is to do that wisely. If we get to Page 13, I think what I said earlier, it's sort of obvious in were circumstances you would just return cash to shareholders. But here's an example of some things that are going on at Navient under the hood that perhaps aren't well highlighted. So what I'm going to take is earnest. And Earnest is something we bought 5 years ago or so. But the point is that it's a new brand to Navient. And it's customer-focused, and it's designed to focus on relationships. And what we mean by that is a relationship is something that causes a customer to come back for another product after he got the first work. The reason you want that is enables you to build attractive lifetime economics with customers. In that sense, it's distinct from the Navient brand. There's nothing wrong with the Navient brand, but it's a servicing brand. So the interaction you have with it is collecting a loan that might have been written by the education development or maybe it's one of our own ones. We do the best we can to treat you properly. We try and be efficient and sympathetic to state necessary. But at the end of that relationship, you don't expect to see us again. So it's not the right sort of brand to build a business in the future. So Earnest has been going for a while, is now running at a bit less than $200 million a year of revenue. It's principally focused on education industry types of products at the moment. Our objective is to move that out into a broader set of product lines at some point in the future. But what we have today is a lending business which has generated essentially all our new loans in recent years, which is highly efficient and we'll tell you about it in a second. There's another part of our industry, which we're calling a financial counseling platform, really for lack it anything more imagine as if to call it. And in my own work in engineering, this would be the difference between saying what something is and what it does. So financial counseling is what it is. What it does is that it enables us to address a much broader base of customers than we have today to build our relationships potentially for the future and also to develop Dasa for the sorts of things you might do next. But the management team at Earnest is quite a bit younger than some of the other management at Navient. And one of the things that they've done, I think, quite well is to resist some pressure to monetize this business too soon. So it does generate a little bit of revenue. But the way to think about it is it's all paid for within Earnest soft rating budget. So just quickly covering the brand point. As we said, we're trying to target a certain kind of customer try and target them efficiently. What's on the page here is that Navient periodically does a brand health survey. There are 11 brands in here. One of them is Navient one of them is Earnest the other 9 are competitive companies. And there are lots of attributes. We just picked some of them. But as you know, generally speaking, financial services companies are not super well liked by their customers. But if you look at these attributes, what find is that Earnest in its dealings with people is perceived as being fair, is being ethical, being reliable. What is not perceived as is being aggressive or arrogant. So if you come back to the efficiency of acquiring customers, if you treat them properly, they come back and that's much cheaper than getting a new one. So that's the point I think we will turn. So just to give you a bit of an insight into how our industry is doing. On the lending side, the principal thing it does is graduate loan refinancing at the moment. There's 5% to 10% (inaudible) the in-school lending, but I don't think it's relevant to this discussion. It's not the only thing we want to do, but it's a good place to start and it pays the rent. The reason it's good is it aligns with the sorts of customers you want to get and the characteristics you want, and it's something we know how to do. It's been successful. Our market share in this field is either 1 or 2 for most of the last few years, and we've generated about $9 billion of loans here. It's also now quite profitable that went from a loss in 2020, about $8 million to making about $80 million pretax today. The counseling platform, I think the point to make here is that over that time, it's grown fourfold, a bit more so. And so you are almost 2 million users. Earnest has probably 150,000 customers. So it's multiples of people that you have relationships with above those that you actually currently lend to you today. The reason that's important is that there may be future customers, but coming back to a point we made earlier, we're looking at product loan extensions. And the most economic way and least risky way of doing that is to test into those things, to do research, to try them out rather than commit hundreds of millions and find out it was a bad idea. And there's an industry celebrity who I have not met personally, who has, I think, a rather way of interesting way of describing consumer lending. He says, people go into it with wide eyes and they come out with black eyes. So one of the principal values of this platform is to enable us to be judicious as we start to add new products. We then... On earnest itself, its business model, why is it distinct? We talked about the brand. But if you think about financial services, generally, it's very difficult to have a lower cost of funds than other people. Product differentiation this stuff, something people talk about, but at best, is fleeting. So neither of those are going to be advantages for us. So what Earnest is focused on is targeting customers who are efficient and then managing that process efficiently. So if you think about a lot of people in the industry generally talk about they say, well, our NIM will be better because we'll charge people more for the same product than other people will get, or we'll fund it cheap er than other people can do or our cost of customer acquisition will be less. All of those things are important, but what really counts is the end-to-end deficiencies. So taking a few data points there. Earnest is acquiring customers at an annualized cost of about 30 bps. And what that is, it's a little bit more than 1% to get one, you keep in the not 4 years. Another element of efficiency is that we're targeting more affluent customers. So the average balance that earned us at the moment is about $50,000, which is almost 3x what our legacy portfolio is. And in fact, that $50,000 is trending a little bit higher as we speak. And then the other point on here is the realized loss rate. And the 40 bps might sound attractive. It probably is helpful in generating NIM. But the more important point in an end-to-end analysis is all the people you don't chase, you don't have to borrow (inaudible). You don't have to think about it every day, don't cost you money to manage. And so in terms of efficiency, that's probably the major advantage of targeting those kinds of customers. Just to wrap up on it, it just sounds like a plug. I would have to say that it really isn't because we haven't decided firmly what to do with it or about it. But having said that, we talked earlier about operating leverage. And one of the great things about the project that the guys did is you were able to identify these points of leverage, you do this, you get that in various elements. So Earnest is an example, I think, of positive operating leverage because you have well-controlled costs and you have a growing revenue base. So to put that in context, if you look at Earnest from 2023 at the end of last year, as revenue increased by, I'm going to call a $125 million. It's marketing expenses went up. But if you get more customers, you have to spend more money to get them. What's interesting though is that the other operating expenses went up by about $15 million. So that's a ratio of a little bit better than 8:1. And as you grow, that ratio actually gets better. So what this looks like to us is a classic example of online growth business economics. So it's probably something that you won't want to find a way to expand.So with that, not to say that they're not very interested in businesses within BPS. But that one, as you know, is subject to an analysis of strategic tentative. So I'm going to turn it back to David, I'm going to get off now. And I'll turn it -- delegate it back to him."", 'David L. Yowan', ""Great. Thanks, Ed. So turning to Page 18, let me provide a brief review of our BPS businesses. These businesses operate in 2 distinct markets with separate operations. Several of the businesses within this group were acquisitions. Our Healthcare business goes to market under the Xtend brand, Xtend offers revenue cycle management services to health care providers and is relatively independent from the rest of Navient from an operational perspective. The government services and transportation businesses operate under several brands and provide a variety of services to federal, state and local governments, its operations share costs, infrastructure and corporate support with the rest of Navient, particularly loan servicing. While we're at an early stage in exploring strategic options for this business, we will keep you updated as that process unfolds. Let me try to summarize on Slide 19. We have identified and we're taking steps to significantly reduce the expense base and simplify the company. These actions are designed to increase the value of the cash flows from our loan portfolios and increase the returns and transparency around growth initiatives. The cash we have on hand, the enhanced cash flows from our loan portfolios and the proceeds of any divestiture of BPS combined could generate significant cash flows in excess of our current market GAAP over the next few years. We will invest that cash in activities that are expected to generate market value in excess of the invested cash. Excess cash will be distributed to shareholders. Shortly following my transition from the Board to the role of CEO, I shared with you my initial impressions from inside the company, namely that Navient has a strong foundation of assets, capabilities and talent. I also said that we would undertake a rigorous review to identify ways in which that foundation can deliver more to shareholders. These actions are the first steps in delivering our full value and potential, and we look forward to providing updates on our progress. With that, I will now turn it over to Joe to review our Q4 results and provide our 2024 outlook."", 'Joe Fisher', ""Thank you, David, Ed and everyone on today's call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2023. I will also provide more detailed guidance underlying our 2024 outlook for earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.30. Our 2024 outlook does not assume any of the strategic actions that we are announcing. It does not include potential benefits from the transition of servicing, any potential divestitures or any restructuring expenses related to these initiatives. This outlook also assumes a declining rate environment with 4 rate cuts. We will update our financial outlook throughout the year as these actions become clear. In 2023, we reported a fourth quarter GAAP EPS loss of $0.25, bringing our full year GAAP EPS to $1.85. On a core basis, we delivered fourth quarter EPS of $0.21 and full year EPS of $2.45. The $0.21 includes a $0.49 reduction to EPS related to significant items in the quarter. Before I move on to the segments, I will provide further detail on 2 of these items. First, we have increased our accrual by $28 million in connection with the CFPB litigation bringing our total accrual to $73 million. We remain confident about the strength of our case, while open to finding a solution that is acceptable to all stakeholders in order to put this matter behind us. Second, in our private credit provision this quarter, we reserved $35 million due to internal policy changes we've made to meet new regulatory expectations related to school misconduct discharges on certain legacy private loans. This increase reflects our assessment of the impact to the legacy portfolios, life of loan discharges from potential borrower claims.I'll now provide additional detail by segment, beginning with Federal Education Loans on Slide 4. The quarter's NIM of 86 basis points reflects the higher rate environment as floor income, including the amounts that were hedged continued to roll off in the second half of this year. We expect FFELP NIM to decline to the low 70s for 2024 due to our interest rate outlook of 4 cuts this year. Falling interest rate environment creates NIM pressure as our FFELP assets repriced more frequently than our liabilities. However, we do not forecast rates to fall far enough to reach a level where significant floor income is generated. Our full year FFELP net interest income declined 8% to $480 million as the portfolio balance declined 13% to $38 billion. The full year FFELP NIM of 112 basis points was above our targeted range of 100 to 110 basis points provided at the beginning of the year. Credit metrics improved in our FFELP portfolio compared to the prior year and third quarter. The delinquency rate for bearance rate and net charge-offs all declined from the prior year. Provision increased from the prior year as longer expected lives primarily driven by a greater percentage of borrowers and income-based repayment plans increases the projected amount of loan premium charged off in the future. The net charge-off rate of 19 basis points for the year was consistent with our expectations of 10 to 20 basis points for the full year. Now let's turn to our Consumer Lending segment on Slide 5. Net interest margin was 291 basis points in the quarter and 304 basis points for the full year. This exceeded our original guidance of 280 to 290 basis points as we benefited from improved funding spreads. We anticipate that the consumer lending NIM will be in the low 300s for 2024. This includes projected new refi originations of $1 billion compared to $647 million in 2023. It also assumes projected growth of 10% in in-school originations. We expect the increase in refi originations to occur primarily in the back half of the year based on our outlook for a declining rate environment. Our consumer lending team is focused on generating high-quality loans with efficient acquisition costs and improved margins. Credit metrics in our consumer lending portfolio performed as expected with delinquency rates, forbearance rates and charge-off rates relatively flat year-over-year. Our charge-off rate for full year 2023 of 1.5% was at the low end of our original guidance of 1.5% to 2%. Provision of $50 million is primarily driven by the changing regulatory expectations that I discussed earlier in my remarks. This is reflected in our change in allowance on Slide 6. At the end of 2023, our allowance for loan losses for our entire education loan portfolio is $1 billion. While much of our portfolio is amortizing, we reserved $5 million for FFELP loans during the quarter and $56 million during the year related to a projected extension in the life of the portfolio. New origination volume contributed $4 million to the allowance in the quarter and $25 million for the full year. Continue to Slide 7 to review our Business Processing segment. Total revenue increased $11 million to $81 million in the quarter as revenue from our traditional BPS services increased $15 million or 23%, more than fully offsetting revenue associated with pandemic-related contracts from a year ago. The full year revenue of $321 million was comprised of $74 million in growth from traditional BPS services and well in excess of the long-term high single-digit growth that we see in the industry. Our full year EBITDA margin of 12% was driven by the onboarding of new government services contracts in the first half of the year. Our EBITDA margin of 15% in the quarter reflects the benefit from ongoing efficiency initiatives as we target high teens EBITDA margins for 2024. Turning to our capital allocation and financing activity that is highlighted on Slide 8. We continue to maintain disciplined asset liability and capital management strategies with 84% of our education loan portfolio funded to term and an adjusted tangible equity ratio of 8.2%. During the quarter, we issued $516 million of asset-backed securitizations and $500 million of unsecured debt. We also retired $850 million of maturities that were due in March of 2024. Our overall unsecured debt maturities declined by 16% to under $6 billion, the lowest levels in our history. In the year, we reduced our share count by 13% through the repurchase of 18 million shares. In total, we returned $388 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We expect the adjusted tangible equity ratio to remain above 8% for 2024. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Total expenses for the year were $825 million. This includes $80 million of regulatory expense primarily related to accruals in connection with the CFPB matter. Operating expenses declined 32% in the Federal Education segment and 10% in the Corporate/Other segment when adjusting for regulatory expenses. We achieved an efficiency ratio of 53% for the year, better than our original full year outlook of 55% to 58%. The strategic initiatives we are undertaking reflect our commitment to identify additional and more meaningful opportunities to reduce expenses. In closing, the full year results of $2.45 reflect the steps we have taken to achieve profitable growth, address regulatory matters and maintain strong capital while exploring alternative strategies to maximize cash flows and enhance value for shareholders. Our full year 2024 outlook of $2.10 to $2.30 does not include the impact of strategic initiatives that Dave and Ed outlined occurring this year, though we are confident in our ability to execute on these initiatives. Before I close, I want to thank team Navient for their accomplishments this year and continued commitment to creating further value for all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your time, and I will now hand the call back to Dave."", 'David L. Yowan', ""Thanks, Joe. As I said at the outset, we had a lot to share this morning. While we pursue the actions we're announcing today, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our borrowers on growing our BPS businesses by delivering the services our customers and clients seek from us and with Earnest on growing loan originations and building engagement and deepening relationships. We will update you on our progress and call out the impacts within our 2024 results as needed. As they come into sharper focus by the second half of the year, we expect to be able to provide a revised outlook and our going-forward opportunities and plans. I also want to acknowledge and thank my colleagues across the organization who continue to serve our customers and clients. The actions we are announcing today represent significant change. I know that as we navigate these changes, our team members will remain committed to servicing our customers and clients with distinction and care. With that, we're ready to move to Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Deutsche Bank.', 'Mark Christian DeVries', ""Yes. I was hoping you could give us a little better sense of kind of the net financial impact of these 3 major steps you talked about. I mean the $400 million of expense saves are obviously pretty significant. But I believe it's less than kind of the consensus expectations for BPS revenue as we look out to 2025. So how should we think about kind of the net impact to earnings? And also how much incremental capital you may free up either through the sale of BPS to kind of offset any kind of potential earnings dilution?"", 'David L. Yowan', ""Mark, thanks for the question. First, let me clarify the scenario that we're using when we refer to the $400 million of expenses. So the scenario assumes that we have completed our outsourcing transaction, the one we announced this morning. We have divested BPS in its entirety, and we have taken the steps to reduce our shared service footprint and our corporate footprint to reflect those 2 transactions. So that's the scenario that underlies it. When you think about the financials of that, you might start with BPS and look at our 2023 actuals to calibrate this. During 2023, we had roughly $325 million worth of revenue and BPS, and we had $280 million worth of expenses. So either of those would be present under this scenario. Our servicing expenses would no longer be present. The first-party servicing expenses that we incur today with no longer be present as well. Our shared service expenses, many of those shared between loan servicing and BPS would no longer be present as well as a smaller corporate footprint would mean that our operating expenses would be lower under that scenario. Now we have to add back the fact that we would now pay our outsourced vendors for servicing our loan portfolio. So you bucket all those things together and the cumulative impact on operating expenses is a reduction of $400 million with a revenue decline of $325 million. That's how it would impact in 2023 actuals. Now it's important to note that when we talk about finalizing these actions in 2024, what we're talking about is becoming more certain about what that scenario actually is. We have -- we're further along in the outsourcing process. And so we have more confidence and more visibility, not perfect yet, but we have more confidence and more visibility into what that will look like during 2024 and we'll share those impacts with you. We're less far along in the process relative to BPS. And so we'll keep you updated along the way as we determine whether, in fact, we do divest all of it as in that scenario and/or whether there's some variation of that. The shared service reductions and the corporate footprint reductions, the timing of those and the nature of those depends on those first 2 transactions as well. For example, if we don't sell all of BPS, for example, then we may have more stranded costs to take out than if we sell all of it in a piece is an example of that. The other pieces that we have not -- that are not in the outlook is both the nature of the transactions that we end up doing. So what will be the scenario. And then if we sell BPS, what are the sale proceeds. So when we talk about giving greater visibility into the second half of the year, we're talking about at that point, we will know what the scenario is, and we'll have greater visibility into the timing and the amount of any transition items that get us there. Hope that's responsive, Mark."", 'Mark Christian DeVries', ""Yes, that's helpful. And just a follow-up on BPS. Is the divestiture there kind of an imperative just given the decision to outsource servicing given some of the significant shared expenses, at least on the government services side. So is it also possible to hold on to health care just given it doesn't have -- as you mentioned, it's more self-contained it doesn't share the same kind of corporate expense."", 'David L. Yowan', ""Yes. I think you're thinking about it is exactly the way that we're thinking about it, Mark. I think I commented on this in his remarks. I would think about the timing of BPS and our decision to explore strategic options is absolutely tied to our decision to outsource because we have this significant shared service infrastructure, and it makes sense to make a decision about those and analyze those as close to simultaneously as we can. We will look at -- so I wouldn't call it imperative, I would call it the timing makes sense for us. And then as you indicate, there's -- and as we called out, there are different uses and different reliance on that shared service infrastructure, even within our BPS businesses, we'll clearly consider that and think about that as we decide on this scenario that we follow for that particular business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi.', 'Arren Saul Cyganovich', ""Just thinking about it from a high-level perspective, if you exit BPS in your remaining businesses are very much simplified. You have a runoff portfolio that you've had all along and you have Earnest, which you laid out some of the benefits there. But Earnest is a little bit challenged in the near term, it seems like just from its primary business has been on refi, and that's facing some challenges because of the interest rate environment and the in-school businesses is quite small. I guess what's really left to provide growth if you're exiting BPS and you have this runoff portfolio."", 'David L. Yowan', ""So thanks for the question, Arren. I think a couple of things I'd call you to. First, I go back to Ed's remarks and the way we're thinking about Earnest in terms of not just a lend-centric or lend first model, but a way to establish relationships and engagement with the student cohort that I think sets us up and gives us some optionality going forward to decide whether there's other product lines or other services that we can provide to that cohort. I would also point out that our -- the loan origination targets that Joe described for Earnest do represent a 40% growth on a combined basis, refi and SLO compared to our actuals for 2023. So I think that's a significant growth rate and a demonstration of our confidence and commitment and our ability to compete effectively in those markets while focusing on our overall efficiency in creating those assets. That's really the goal that we have is to continue to minimize and optimize our cost of acquisition, our collection costs by selecting the right customer segments that allow us to continue to grow on that financial trajectory that we shared, I think, for the first time this."", 'Arren Saul Cyganovich', 'Okay. And then I was wondering if you could also provide any additional color on the $28 million of contingency loss. You cited some recent developments in the CFPB matters.', 'David L. Yowan', ""Yes. There's -- so there's 2 matters, right? One is the CFP matter is just additional accrual based on the developments in the case, the litigation in the quarter, just like last quarter, we don't -- won't comment on the development of those. So that's what the $28 million is."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Talent.', 'Moshe Ari Orenbuch', ""Great. Both said, Dave, you talked a lot about cash that's available. But you also talked about kind of maintaining above an 8% TCE ratio. Could you talk about, #1, how much share repurchases in your '24 guidance? And how you think about the impacts of this plan on TCE, whether they are charges that you might have to take to get out of expenses and contracts and other things and severance and other things like that and any other kind of things that might impact during '24."", 'Joe Fisher', ""Thank you, Moshe. I think on the capital ratio and just overall guidance, what's embedded in our $2.10 to $2.30 is share repurchases of just under $140 million. So that will help you with adjusted tangible equity ratio which we believe will be above 8%. And as you know, the biggest driver of that ratio is just a success in new buying in school as we hold 5% capital on the refi book and 10% for our in-school loans. So that's going to be the biggest determinant of how far above or really above that 8% range that we end up. And a big driver of that is just going to be what you think about, obviously, the interest rate trajectory for the back half of the year."", 'David L. Yowan', 'And then Joe in terms of, sorry, go ahead.', 'Joe Fisher', ""Yes. I was just going to follow up on the second part of your question there about just future charges with all of the strategic actions that are potentially taking place. Our goal certainly is to limit any types of restructuring charges going forward. Our guidance does not include that. But our goal is to minimize the expenses associated with that. And certainly, the valuation is going to be a determinant event, and we're going to look to maximize the value of these transactions, and that's going to be -- play a big role in determining obviously any capital implications going forward."", 'Moshe Ari Orenbuch', ""Great. And just as a follow-up, maybe a follow-up to Mark DeVries question on BPS. Can you talk a little bit about that you're expecting a 15% kind of EBITDA margin. You had a 12% EBITDA margin this year. Just talk about the range of the various contracts in there around that 15%. And whether you've got indications of interest on any of those? And which of those are perhaps more likely or less likely and how to think about that in terms of the various elements within more BPS business?"", 'Joe Fisher', ""Sure. So just to make sure I'm capturing your question. Just the range of EBITDA within the various sectors, whether it's health care, government services and contracts is what you're asking?"", 'Moshe Ari Orenbuch', ""Yes. I mean I'm assuming they all on average..."", 'Joe Fisher', ""Yes. So ultimately, it does vary contract by contract. I think if you look at some publicly traded companies, typically, health care does earn a higher -- certainly higher multiple and has higher EBITDA margins than those related to federal contracts. So it does vary contract by contract. And what you've seen over the last several years is that we've actually exited a number of our lower-margin contracts, which has contributed to the growth that we've seen and the benefits that we received in the EBITDA margin. So while full year was 12%, we ended this year at 15% for the quarter and guidance is for the high teens for next year. And as you can see in our presentation, if you look back in the appendix, there's about a 10% revenue growth implied in that as well as achieving the margins that we're laying out. So ultimately, I think just if you look at this business, it's a very attractive business that we historically have just not received the multiple that you see others getting in this space. And so that's one of the things that we're looking at here and certainly a driver of our -- one of the drivers of our decisions."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners.', 'William Haraway Ryan', ""First, just going back to the high level question investors have been asking if I buy the shares of Navient, what exactly do I own? You've kind of outlined your commitment to Earnest and adding some new products, details somewhat forthcoming. But thinking about the sale of BPS and adding the products and services to Earnest, our acquisitions or bolt-on acquisitions and the thought process of maybe using some of the proceeds from BPS."", 'David L. Yowan', ""This is Dave. Thanks for the question. Look, I think it's too soon in the process to talk about that. Again, the strategy that Ernest has had and will continue to execute against this year is to continue to build engagement with students through the financial counseling platform. That includes things like, for example, student loan manager, which is a capability that helps students that have federal loans to determine what the best payment and refinancing options are for them. At the same time, we'll be, as I just indicated, growing our loan originations by almost 40% this year, while we're looking at the different product lines, et cetera, that we might be able to build off that engaged user base when we find a set of products and services that we think we can offer. There's a variety of ways that we might do that. It could be through acquisition, it could be through an organic build, it could be through affiliates. I think you've seen all those models work in financial services. And I would say all those things would be on the table if we go down that route."", 'William Haraway Ryan', ""Okay. And one follow-up just on the FFELP margin guide. I know that the floor income contracts are running off, et cetera, and the interest rate environment is going to be a little bit more adverse to the margin. But for Joe, it's kind of thinking is as you exit 2024, you guided obviously to the margin being (inaudible) for the full year. Is the margin going to be lower as we exit 2024 or fairly steady over the course of the year."", 'Joe Fisher', ""So it's going to be lower as you get into the back half of '24, just from the margin pressure component of it. So as the -- using the 4 cut scenario that we're projecting here, that pressure itself, we would estimate contributes about 10 basis points of pressure throughout the year, but more so in the back half as those rates and objective is early in the front half of the year. So we should see that impact back at the before component. You're going to start to see that early in the first quarter, and you've already started to see that this quarter. There was about 5 basis point contribution this quarter versus last quarter from the floors rolling off. That goes to about 15 basis points as you get into the first quarter."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.', 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', ""I want to go back to Slide 9 because to me, it seems like that's the most critical part of the story going forward. And it seems like the name of the game should be trying to optimize the flow through of all these cash flows. And I know that's sort of what you're working on with all of these initiatives. David, maybe you could just help us think about dimensionalizing how much can flow. It doesn't seem like there's a lot that flow through if you have the current cost structure. But obviously, the adjustments you're making, as you've indicated, substantially free up the flow through. But maybe you could just talk about the aim over the next 5 years and beyond sort of how much of that flow through we can get? Because obviously, that's a big part of the thesis where the market cap is lower than these cash flows."", 'David L. Yowan', ""Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. So there's a couple of pieces to that. I'd say I just -- one piece is just the financial implications of the 3 strategic actions that we took that I ran through the financials a bit earlier, so I'd call you back to that. That clearly in that scenario, reduces expenses by more than the revenue that would no longer be present in the company. I think the second thing is that moving to a variable servicing model has some pretty powerful leverage for us relative to where we are today. We don't project for you our servicing costs out over the remaining life of the loan. But I think you can think about that in terms of we have a fixed cost base and we have a variable cost base. And so as loans pay off and the portfolio amortizes as it has done on a net basis for all but 1 year in Navient's history, when we originated $6 billion of refi loans in 2019. So in that amortizing scenario, you've seen the variable costs come out as the loan count goes down. But at some point, that fixed cost base doesn't go down as rapidly as the loan count going down. And so the variable cost model, we think produces significant not just operational flexibility, but significant substantial financial benefits as and if the loan portfolio continues to amortize that's very different than the model that we have today. And I think the third piece is just the financing piece and the cost of that, both unsecured and secured liabilities and we have -- the team has done a terrific job over the years of optimizing and reducing that. We think there are some other opportunities that give us some optionality and flexibility that we're going to be looking at over the coming months. So I think those are the 3 buckets. It's largely reducing the corporate footprint in the business profile that is slimmer and leaner. That includes a corporate expense reduction. It's the moving to a variable cost model and then reducing our cost of financing as well. Those are the 3 levers that we have."", 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', ""Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up question on BPS. I know some questions were asked already. But when you're thinking about like preliminary indications of interest, any dimensionalization of what kind of valuation that business can get? Because it seems, as you go -- as Joe sort of alluded to, that it is a higher valuation business and what sort of suggested in the valuation of your stock? Or are there some nuances there that we should be aware of?"", 'Joe Fisher', ""Thank you, Sanjay. I think it's just too early to comment on that, but I would just point to public companies in that space and look at the multiples, both on the health care RCM side as well as government services, BPS and then just more diversified BPO businesses, all receiving a higher multiple than what we received today."", 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', ""Could I just ask one more question on in-school originations. Is that no longer going to happen? Or because I don't think I heard anything about that, but maybe you could just clarify on that."", 'Joe Fisher', ""And I think as Dave reiterated in my comments, we are looking to grow 10% on the in-school side and overall, just from an origination perspective, north of 40% when you combine refi and in school. So we're certainly very committed to growing this business."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. .', 'John Hecht', ""One point of clarification David, you mentioned, I think it's $400 million of kind of identified potential cost saves that would come with $325 million that's, I guess, the BPS revenues. I just want to clarify, is that net of the outsourced servicing? Or does that include the total concept of the outsourced servicing?"", 'David L. Yowan', ""So thanks for the question. When we say net, it means it considers the fact that we would need to pay an outsourced provider for servicing our loans. So that's what -- so it is included and the expense reduction is net of what we would pay to that provider. So those are -- that's how we would think about it. And I would just remind you that those numbers that we're using are based on 2023 actuals. So if you had that scenario and that was in place for 2023, that's where we got the volumes and the amounts that we've shared with you."", 'John Hecht', 'Okay. And second question, I think Joe said the originations in Earnest, the refi originations would be more back weighted just because of interest rate reductions. I mean maybe a little bit more kind of information on the cadence there and how sensitive our originations to rate cuts in that segment?', 'Joe Fisher', ""I think certainly, as rate cuts can -- if that does happen, I think there's a tremendous opportunity, certainly, especially if it's beyond 4 rate cuts. So the way I think about it is that if I'm looking at the first quarter, fairly similar to what we've seen in this fourth quarter and then starting to pick up in the back half of the year. I just think about the scenario that I'm referring to, as you get 50 basis points, 75 basis point cuts overall, that should be more of an impact than what you're seeing today. So that growth should occur and be more backloaded and then more back loaded to, obviously, the fourth quarter versus the first quarter just depending on where rates are."", 'John Hecht', 'Okay. And then a final question is ERF if I can. I know this is out there, but Ernest, you talked about incremental products and services. Is this going to be event-centric business? Or is there going to be other fee-oriented products? And if so, could you just give us some maybe examples of what those might look like?', 'David L. Yowan', ""Yes. I think both things are on the table. Obviously, from a number of -- a good mix, I mean, Earnest is a consumer-centric enterprise. So the first thing to do will be to try to find and identify unmet needs or needs that customers have that we can serve. I think they've done a nice job of demonstrating that, particularly in the refi space. And then if you think about product line extensions, that would encompass potentially both additional lending products, but also potential fee-generating products rather than lending products as well. Again, that could include third-party referrals based on our cost of acquisition of a customer, it could involve other kind of products. That work is underway. We have as we ask we've asked for some time to come back to you later in the year with where we came out on that, give some initial one."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.', 'Richard Barry Shane', ""Look, I think we reflect on the last 6 or 7 years in terms of capital returns, both to equity holders and bondholders, I think you guys have done a good job. In terms of maintaining operating efficiency in the context of the shrinking business. I think you guys have done a reasonably good job. The challenge has been growing revenues. What I heard today is a strategy that seeks to maximize shareholder value by optimizing the cash flows and staying very disciplined about returning those cash flows to investors, to stakeholders. Again, very consistent with what we've seen over the last 5 or 6 years. At the end of the day, you guys are just still kind of squeezing the same fruit tighter and tighter. Where is the growth going to come from? We hear about Earnest. We hear about the in-school initiatives. But again, that seems to be a pretty big opportunity given you've seen 2 of the largest players exit in the last 3 years. The market share objectives to 10% growth are pretty modest. Why not be more aggressive there? Or where are the other opportunities to actually start driving top line again?"", 'David L. Yowan', ""Thanks, Rick, for the question. I think I could back to -- while we have done -- I think the team has done a good job of managing the expenses over time in a shrinking portfolio environment. What we're trying to communicate today is that there's a lot more work that these 3 actions are designed to address. And it's not just about expense reduction, but as Ed indicated, that overhead, if you will, in a broad sense, the shared service functions, the corporate overhead and our cost of equity all conspire to make growth initiatives more challenged than they need to be, right? Because the portfolio is shrinking. If we don't get rid of those central costs, then they get allocated growth initiatives that burdens them in a way that doesn't allow them to reach their full potential or give us the capacity to make them. So the first thing we're going to -- what we're trying to accomplish is actually to unburden the growth initiatives but also at the same time and in the same way, increases our capacity to invest by increasing the amount of legacy loan cash flows that we have a decision to make a capital allocation decision to make about return and otherwise. With respect to the Earnest growth proposition, I think we tried to lay out what Ernest has accomplished over the last 3 or 4 years. I think that's impressive from a financial perspective. The brand health is a good indication that Earnest has found a way to surprise and delight the customers that it engages with and a customer experience. I know that Ed indicated this, my experience in financial services, that's a really hard thing to do, and they've accomplished that. That's a really good foundation for us to think about how we can take those relationships and that positive brand attribute that Earnest has, which does not exist in the Navient brand and see what opportunities we have to grow off of that. And that's more to come on that. We're not ready to share that with you today. But that's the foundation that we see for growth in Earnest."", 'Richard Barry Shane', ""Got it. Look, I -- the track record at Earnest has been very good. And obviously, the movement in rates has been a headwind, but that's -- I mean that's beyond your control. I think in hindsight, that's proven to be a very thoughtful investment and ultimately will create value. What I'm hearing is there's a chicken and egg problem, which is that the cost of capital makes it in the high hurdle rate makes investing in growth on attractive, but because there's no growth, I think the cost of capital is elevated. You guys, in your slides link the multiple compression to the decline of efficiency. And I think that, that's a very fair conclusion, but I would suggest also that the decline in multiple is really a reflection of top line shrinking almost every year for the past decade. And I do wonder if there is some opportunity to break that paradigm that it might be painful in the short term to invest. And by the way, I think if we think about the history of Earnest in that acquisition, there was disappointment at the time in that investment, but it has manifested into something that's valuable. Is it time to break the paradigm again?"", 'David L. Yowan', ""Yes. I think you summarized maybe in a little different way what we've been trying to communicate in the strategy update. It is a -- I won't call it a vicious circle, but it is a cycle that we're in that has driven our cost of equity. And so we're addressing the things that we can address, which is to give ourselves some financial capacity and flexibility, give investors more transparency on the growth initiatives. I think this is the first time we've broken out Earnest Financials. It's been within the Consumer Lending segment, which added both private legacy runoff and Earnest growth within it. So we're trying to provide the transparency of the market. So you can more clearly see the growth and get a sense of the growth potential and the opportunitiesin that Earnest."", 'Richard Barry Shane', ""Very fair. And by the way, I should say I very much appreciate the transparency with -- that you guys provided today in terms of the strategy, it's very helpful and one of the more honest things we've seen in terms of company sharing their outlooks ever. So thank you very much."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley.', 'Jeffrey David Adelson', ""I guess I just wanted to circle back on Earnest and in Slide 13, you talked about how it's currently profitable at the $200 million revenue run rate and appreciate the new disclosure there. I'm just curious, is that more of a run rate today in this environment where originations have slowed and you don't -- I know this is a revenue number. Just trying to understand how to think about the profitability of the business over a cycle, where you think kind of the core returns or return on equity could be for that business over the longer term? Because as you lean into originations later this year, presumably next year, that does come with that higher CECL reserve charge at first, and it sounds like you're going to be building out and adding on some products, which probably first will cost some money. So just trying to think through what you think the profitability metrics and returns are for that business."", 'Joe Fisher', ""You're right, Jeff it to bring it into the CECL accounting here. The more successful we are in terms of the refi environment, the higher provision that it's taken so that impacts the current year. So ultimately, I think it's a good projection of where we're headed. So as we think about the current environment we're in and the growth potential that's going to lead to, obviously, future growth down the line in '25 and '26. But if there is a dramatic downturn in rates, and we have that opportunity to originate more loans that would put pressure on the current year's income just because we have a higher provision because of the life of loan reserve that we have to take. So it's a good way to think about it is that if you think about just the interest rate environment last year and the shift, we would have had even higher net interest income coming into this year, but because of the higher interest rates, it's been about that $200 million in run rate, but the opportunity for growth going forward is going to be primarily driven on the refi side by the opportunities here in the projected rate environment."", 'David L. Yowan', ""Jeff, I would just add, I'd encourage you to look -- as I know, you did at 16 and 17 as well because 16 talks about the overall efficiency of loan originations from a cost of acquisition from a servicing cost and from a reserving perspective. And then 17 by breaking out the marketing expense, obviously, that's going to be variable with our cost of acquisition, but we're -- you can see it on Page 17 actually the operating leverage -- positive operating leverage that Ed referred to implicit in the kind of distribution model that Ernest has. So there's a temporary -- there'll be an increase in marketing expense and and provision expense, excuse me, with higher originations, we'll get some operating leverage on the -- we expect to continue to have operating leverage on that other line. And obviously, those originations are building a revenue stream to increasingly fund additional originations or some of the growth strategies that we're talking about."", 'Jeffrey David Adelson', ""Okay. Great. And as my follow-up, I just want to circle back on John's question on the cost to outsource. I know you're discussing how it's netted out of the number and then you're moving to a more variable cost model there. But could you maybe help us understand what -- how to quantify what that cost outsource is?"", 'David L. Yowan', ""Yes. So look, I think we've said a couple of things that I'd just refer you to. First of all, when we did the outsourcing or the RFP exercise, we did find that our current cost is comparable. And so we're not pointing you or guiding you to look to a significant reduction in servicing expense in the near term. We won't be pointing to that and you shouldn't look and find that. But if you go to the loan cash flow page that we have and think about the tenure of the portfolio that we have over the lifetime of that loan, having our servicing cost 100% variable versus a mixture of fixed and variable, we think, has some really careful operating leverage to us over the remaining life of the franchise. And I'll just leave it at that. It's a question of -- it's not a lower unit cost. It's a different mix between fixed and variable that drives operating leverage that's not present in our current cost structure and our current servicing model."", 'Operator', ""And that is all the time that we have for questions today. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Jen Earyes for closing remarks."", 'Jen Earyes', ""Thanks, Mara. I know that there are remaining questions that we have not been able to deal this morning. So please contact me if we were not able to take your question or if we were, if you have any other follow-up questions, happy to chat. We'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. This concludes our call. Thank you.""]"

Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to ""Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA"" is ""Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders"". It can also be derived by adding together each segment’s ""Adjusted EBITDA"" plus ""Non-allocated expenses."" Management believes this measure provides WestRock’s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate WestRock’s performance because it excludes restructuring and other costs, net, business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business.

Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to ""Adjusted Segment Sales"" is ""segment sales."" Additionally, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin, excluding trade sales"" is ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin.""

Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor our revenues and expenses in ""Constant Currency"" - i.e., as if the current period\'s currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period\'s rates. For the 2023 periods presented, we calculate ""Constant Currency"" by applying the average for 2019 or Q4 2019 period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months of the reported and/or forecasted period, so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods.

And that's because their businesses are still experiencing some strong growth and they have to set some cash aside to help fund those growth opportunities. "", ""Even though their yields may not be terribly high, three dividend stocks that can make for excellent long-term dividend plays are UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), Visa (NYSE: V), and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST). Here's a closer look at their dividend streaks and why their payouts could continue rising for years to come."", 'Health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group increased its dividend in 2023 for the 14th straight year. What was notable about its dividend increase was the size: 14%. While many dividend stocks make modest increases to their payouts, UnitedHealth has been aggressive with its rate hikes. The current quarterly dividend of $1.88 is more than double the $0.90 it was paying its shareholders just five years ago.', ""UnitedHealth's dividend yield of 1.5% is in line with the S&P 500 average but it would be much higher if not for the stock's impressive gains; in 10 years, UnitedHealth shares have risen by more than 600%."", 'The company recently wrapped up another strong year; 2023 revenue rose 15% year over year to $371.6 billion. Operating cash flow was also a monstrous $29.1 billion, nearly $3 billion higher than what the company brought in a year earlier.', ""UnitedHealth's strong industry position coupled with a rising senior population in the U.S. ensures there is plenty more growth on the horizon for the company, which bodes well for dividend investors as well, as that is likely to result in better earnings numbers and higher dividend payments."", ""Credit card giant Visa is a low-yielding stock with a payout of only 0.8%. But what's promising about the stock as a potential income investment is the stability it offers. Credit cards are in use regardless of economic cycles. In challenging conditions, people may use them heavily to make ends meet. In good times, consumers may still be using credit cards to collect points and benefit from the varied perks that they offer."", 'Visa just reported numbers for the first quarter of its fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), and net revenue rose 9% year-over-year to $8.6 billion. Net income jumped an even higher 17% to $4.9 billion. The business looks to be in fine shape, even amid inflation and as consumers tighten up their spending. ', ""As the economy grows, credit card spending is likely to pick up on Visa's network. Being a leader in the industry, the company is in an excellent position to get even larger and more valuable in the years ahead."", ""The stock's 10-year returns are around 400% and the company has been raising its dividend since 2009. With a modest payout ratio of just 22%, this makes for an excellent dividend growth stock to buy and hold for years."", ""Big-box retailer Costco has been increasing its dividend for nearly two decades. Although its yield looks underwhelming at 0.6%, that doesn't tell the whole story. A big reason the yield isn't higher is, like the other stocks on this list, it has been such a phenomenal investment; over the past decade, the stock is up 500%."", ""Those are some mouthwatering returns, which more than make up for a low dividend yield. And Costco has also paid special dividends multiple times over the years. It recently paid a special dividend of $15 per share -- that's more than 3 times its annual dividend of $4.08."", ""Costco has generated more than $6.5 billion in profit over the trailing 12 months on revenue of $245.7 billion. Although those make for a fairly lean (2.7%) margin, this business has proven it knows what it's doing, carefully calculating which markets to go into and which products to sell. "", ""The company has achieved significant growth in just the past few years; in fiscal 2023, which ended on Sept. 3, 2023, the company's top line totaled $242.3 billion. That has increased by more than 45% in just three years. "", ""Costco's versatile and robust business makes this a solid stock to own for the long term, and it's also an underrated dividend investment."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them.

It powers 4.3 billion cards globally, a number equal to more than half the world's population."", 'It processed more than $15 trillion in payments over the trailing 12 months, and it works with more than 14,500 financial institutions worldwide.', ""You might think it's unbeatable, and in certain ways, it is. But there's another credit card company that makes almost double Visa's revenue, and you might be surprised to learn that it's American Express (NYSE: AXP)."", 'Many people think of Visa and American Express as similar credit card networks. But they actually function quite differently.', 'Visa is mostly a processor, although it does have some other services. To send money through its vast network, merchants and clients need to pay it a small fee for every swipe.', ""However, it doesn't provide any loans, or credit, to those who make purchases. It's like highway that can speed your payment to a destination. It relies on partnerships with financial institutions like banks to provide the credit. That's why a Visa credit card is always branded with a bank name, and you get approval for one through the issuing bank, which lends you the money."", ""American Express has what's called a closed-loop system, which means it acts as its own issuing bank. It does not typically work with outside financial partners. That gives it some resemblance to Visa, but also some resemblance to standard banks. It only has 140 million cards in circulation, a tiny fraction of Visa's count."", 'This is a bit of a trick question, because it depends how you define ""big."" Visa has more cardholders and processes more payment volume. But American Express\' trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue of $60 billion is almost double Visa\'s TTM revenue of $33 billion.', ""How is that so? There's another important difference between the two. Most of American Express' members pay an annual fee, and that could be as high as $5,000.\xa0While Visa cardholders might pay an annual fee, it goes to the issuing bank, not to Visa."", ""American Express' customers also spend more. Amex has been processing about $400 billion in payments volume quarterly, while Visa processes more than $3.5 trillion. American Express has only about 3% of Visa's card count, but it processes more than 10% of Visa's volume. It's also known to take a higher merchant fee than Visa, which adds up with every swipe."", ""Now that I've shown you that American Express might be a much bigger company, the last piece of this is the fact that Visa actually has a much bigger bottom line, with net income more than double Amex's figure. So at the end of the day, Visa takes home much more money."", ""Visa has an unbeatable profit margin that's consistently more than 50%, and it was an incredible 57% in the fiscal 2024 first quarter, whereas American Express' profit margin was only 12% in the 2023 fourth quarter."", 'Part of the American Express model is the many perks it offers that attract an affluent consumer. These add up in its expenses, which were $45 billion in 2023.', ""On top of that, American Express' banking division has been feeling the impact of higher interest rates, and it has more than doubled its reserves to increase its provisions for losses. That comes out of net income."", 'These two stocks moved in tandem with the broader market last year, with American Express slightly outdoing Visa and the S&P 500.', ""Investors were cheering American Express' recent quarterly report, while they were less enthused about Visa's. But both of these offer a similar glimpse into the state of the economy."", 'You can be like Warren Buffett, who has positions in both Visa and American Express. Each brings something different to the table and offers the growth of a fintech stock with the reliability of an established financial stock.', ' Buffett seems to favor American Express, which accounts for 8.1% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, its third-largest position. American Express has a better dividend, which is an important piece for Buffett, and its brand and pricing power are incredible.', 'Investing in either or both of these stocks is investing in the future of the U.S. economy, which is a theme for Buffett. Having at least one in your portfolio is an excellent value choice.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?', 'Before you buy stock in American Express, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and American Express wasn't one of them.

Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:"", '\'\'Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,"" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.', ""In 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital. The fund had $661 million under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. You will see some of the top names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the fund's portfolio as well as spot under-the-radar small-cap names which could explode in the future."", 'Skylands Capital\'s investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to ""extrapolate"" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who ""can anticipate change before it is obvious.""', 'Value or Growth?', 'Charles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.', '""It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay.

It’s ironic that he remains remarkably bound to fossil fuels, in ways he probably hopes nobody notices.', 'Biden’s entire energy agenda during the last three years has paired the overt promotion of renewables with a covert effort to keep fossil fuels plentiful and cheap. The latest example is the Biden administration’s Jan. 26 decision to temporarily suspend the approval of new facilities for exporting natural gas. Current facilities will continue to operate, without any limit on exports.', 'The pause will let the Energy Department study the impact of surging US natural gas exports on the climate, domestic energy prices, national security concerns, and other factors. The review will take several months, followed by the usual comment period. You won’t go broke betting the farm that an outcome will come in 2025, well after the November elections.', 'In one regard, a review makes sense. The fracking revolution that kicked off around 2010 generated a massive boom in US fossil fuel production, which has made the United States the world’s biggest oil and gas producer. US law limited energy exports until President Barack Obama signed legislation and changed other rules broadly allowing oil and gas exports. Starting in 2015, gas exports soared. The Biden administration now says the rules for approving export facilities are outdated and need to account for the nearly fivefold rise in gas exports since 2014.', 'But there’s also a likely political angle when a president makes a controversial policy change in an election year. Environmental groups lobbied hard for the pause on new gas-export facilities, and they declared victory when the White House made the decision. So maybe Biden is reinvigorating his pitch to environmentally minded voters, who skew young and want to see more forceful action to banish the source of greenhouse gases causing global warming.', 'Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.', 'There could also be another target: keeping American energy prices low. Drillers often say that robust exports create an incentive to produce more gas, which in turn keeps domestic supplies abundant and prices low. But that may be wishful thinking. A 2023 analysis by the US Energy Information Administration found that “higher [gas] exports results in upward pressure on US natural gas prices and lower [gas] exports results in downward pressure.” It’s also true that gas prices in other markets, such as Europe and Asia, are considerably higher than in the United States, which creates an obvious incentive for American producers to sell outside the country where they can make more money.', ""So Biden might be making sure there’s no uptick in US energy prices while he’s running for reelection. Natural gas prices get far less attention than gasoline prices, but they’re arguably more important because natural gas powers 40% of the nation’s electricity generation and 60% of home heating. “It seems likely,” Kurt Cobb wrote recently on OilPrice.com, “that someone whispered into the administration's ear something about the possibility of much higher domestic prices in the coming years if the US LNG [liquified natural gas] export juggernaut is allowed to continue.”"", 'US natural gas prices did spike in 2022, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a sharp reduction of Russian gas exports to Europe and a scramble by other gas exporters to fill the gap. US natural gas prices are now back to the relatively low levels typical from 2015 to 2021.', 'Electricity costs have jumped, however, and stayed there. Since Biden took office, electricity costs have risen 27%. That’s a stealthy source of inflation, which has been Biden’s biggest economic problem. Higher electricity prices boost consumers’ utility bills, while also making it more expensive for businesses to produce goods and keep the lights on (literally). Businesses normally try to pass cost increases on to consumers.', ""When inflation spiked in 2022 and gasoline prices hit $5 per gallon, Biden's approval rating dropped sharply. Overall inflation is almost back to normal levels, but Biden clearly recognizes the risk that high energy prices pose to his political future. Since 2022, Biden has taken a variety of measures to lower energy prices: selling oil from the US reserve, asking Saudi Arabia to produce more oil, and even encouraging more energy production by ne'er-do-well nations Iran and Venezuela. Biden's credibility with environmentalists comes from the massive green energy plan he signed into law in 2022, but Biden's overall popularity relies far more on the cost of fossil fuels we're still dependent on."", ""There's good reason for Biden to retain the pro-export policy that began under Obama, continued under President Trump, and remained in place for Biden’s first three years in office. In a Jan. 26 analysis, the Eurasia Group argued that ongoing high levels of American gas exports are an important lifeline to Europe and a key lever of US power in other parts of the world, including Asia. Russia would clearly love more influence in those parts of the world, and the availability of American energy as an alternative to Russia's exports is a barrier to Russia's malign ambitions."", 'So maybe the Biden review will sound the all-clear, with a few permit denials to appease the climate lobby, if Biden wins reelection. But if evidence mounts that energy exports are raising costs for Americans, Biden won’t be the last president to have a problem with that.', 'Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:VZ) recently hit a 52-week high, the stock has not done much over the past decade. However, the wireless giant's fortunes look like they are startning to turn."", 'Verizon provides wireless and wireline services and products in the U.S. On the wireless side, the company provides both post-paid and pre-paid plans that offer voice, data and texting. It also sells third-party smartphones and other wireless-enable devices such as tablets and smartwatches.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with VZ.', 'On the wireline front, the company provides internet services and related equipment through its Fios high-speed internet solution, as well as video and voice services, cloud storage and device protection. It also provides various voice, video conferencing, internet of things, network security and internet services to businesses.', 'In addition, Verizon offers wholesale services to other communication service companies and mobile virtual network operators that sell the services under their own brands.', 'Verizon currently trades at about 7.20 times 2024 Ebitda estimates of $48.70 billion. Based on the current 2025 Ebitda consensus of $49.50 billion, the stock trades at a 7.10 multiple.', 'Revenue is projected to grow 1.40% in 2024 and 1.10% in 2025.', 'The company currently has a free cash flow yield of about 11.50% based on FCF of $20 billion projected for 2024.', 'Over the past decade, Verizon has been plagued by modest revenue growth. Revenue has only risen about 5% from $127.10 billion in 2014 to $134 billion in 2023. The loss of wireline and pre-paid customers have hurt it in this regard.', 'At the same time, the company has also had to spend a lot on capital expenditures to continually upgrade its wireless network, most recently for 5G. It also went out and spent $45 billion to acquire C-Band spectrum at auction in late 2020, early 2021. All in all, it has invested a lot of money for very little return.', 'That has left the company with $148.60 billion in net debt at the end of the third quarter. Leverage stood at 3.10 times on its $47.80 billion in 2023 adjusted Ebitda.', 'However, the fourth quarter saw a bit of a shift for Verizon. It added 449,000 net wireless postpaid customer additions and 413,000 net broadband customer additions. This helped its Consumer Service revenue rise 2.60% for the quarter and for the company to forecast 2% to 3.50% wireless service growth for 2024. Now other parts of the business weighed on the overall quarter, such as business and wholesale revenue, but it was a step in the right direction for its core Consumer Service business.', ""Part of the company's success with its Consumer Service business has been the introduction of its myPlan service, which allows users to choose from various unlimited wireless plan options, and then add various perks, such as discounted streaming bundles, Apple One and Walmart+ memberships. Verizon already has 13.1 million myPlan subscribers since it launched the service in May."", 'The company is also seeing its investment in C-Band starting to pay off. This is helping in two ways. First, its capital intensity is going down. Capital expenditures were $23.10 billion in 2022, $18.80 billion in 2023 and is projected to be below $17.50 billion in 2024. Lower capex leads to stronger free cash flow, which the company can use to reduce its debt.', ""Given its modest growth, debt reduction can be one of the bigger drivers for Verizon's stock. Adjusted Ebitda growth is only expected to rise 1% to 3% in 2024, so shrinking debt to reduce its enterprise value is one way to see the stock price increase without growing Ebitda or multiple expansion. Basically, at the same enterprise value/Ebitda multiple, equity value would replace the shrinking debt, lifting the stock price."", 'At the same time, Verizon said that where it has C-Band, it is seeing lower churn, higher customer adds and more premium services being consumed. The company said 80% of its gross consumer fixed wireless adds came from C-Band markets.', 'During the fourth-quarter earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Anthony Skiadas said:', 'We continue to see better performance in markets where we have deployed C-Band. In our first 76 C-Band markets, fourth quarter Consumer postpaid phone gross add growth was 8 percentage points better than in non-C-Band markets. Additionally, Consumer postpaid phone churn and C-Band markets was 4 basis points better than in non-C-Band markets. The strong momentum in the quarter, combined with the continued deployment of our C-Band network positions us well in 2024. The quality of the business we are writing in Consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive premium plan adoption. The premium take rate in C-Band markets for the quarter was more than 10 percentage points higher than in non-C-Band markets. Consumer ARPA (average revenue per account) of $134.10 represents an increase of 4.7% year-over-year. This was driven by new customer additions, premium plan adoption and fixed wireless subscriber growth. We expect continued and healthy organic ARPA growth in 2024.', 'When it comes to risks, mergers and acquisitions are one. Verizon does not have a very good track record of late when it comes to acquisitions. Its acquisition of TracFone in 2021 has not panned out, while earlier acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo were complete flops. The company hopefully will not be tempted into another one.', 'Prepaid also continues to be a drag with high churn. Meanwhile, with corporate layoffs, business revenue has also been a source of weakness.', 'Competition is also a risk, as the three main wireless companies continue to battle it out. Wireless is a mature market, so retention and churn remain important factors for the industry. Right now, Verizon is starting to win the battle, but AT&T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) will fight back.', 'After a tough decade, Verizon is starting to show some signs of life. Its C-Band bet is beginning to take off at a time when its capital intensity is starting to go down. This is helping it gain customers and increase premium services at the same time. This in turn should help lead to strong free cash flow generation and debt reduction.', 'The stock should have upside from here as the company deleverages, while it also pays a nice dividend that is good for about a 6.40% yield. The company has grown its dividend for 19 straight years, so with improving prospects and debt reduction, it should be a solid option for dividend growth investors.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

When the curtain closed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had managed to hit multiple record highs, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite shot higher by 24% and 43%, respectively. A fresh bull market has emerged, and growth stocks are to thank for it.', 'Although the ""Magnificent Seven"" have collectively taken credit for the outperformance of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite since the start of 2023, no megacap growth stock has stood out more than semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares have skyrocketed more than 327% in less than 13 months, with the company tacking on more than $1 trillion in market value.', ""Nvidia's outperformance is a reflection of the company becoming the infrastructure backbone of the artificial-intelligence (AI) movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to account for up to 90% of the GPUs being put to work in high-compute data centers in 2024."", ""In particular, Nvidia's pricing power with its AI-focused GPUs has been off the charts due to GPU scarcity. This phenomenal pricing power has been a big help to Nvidia's gross margin, given that its cost of revenue has moved only modestly higher."", ""But this top-performing megacap stock is set to face mounting headwinds in 2024 (and beyond). Ironically, ramping up production of its A100 and H100 chips is likely to be a net negative for its gross margin. A substantial uptick in GPU production will reduce AI-GPU scarcity and diminish the company's pricing power."", ""At the same time, competition in AI-inspired GPUs will progressively increase. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel know a thing or two about innovation and data center operations. Both companies are direct competitors to Nvidia's high-compute data center dominance."", ""I'll also add that U.S. regulators are doing Nvidia no favors. On two separate occasions, regulators have imposed restrictions on what chips the company can export to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Even GPUs that Nvidia designed specifically for China have been restricted. These export limitations could cost Nvidia billions of dollars in potential sales each quarter."", 'Lastly, every next-big-thing investment over the past three decades has eventually gone through an initial bubble period. Wall Street and investors historically overestimate the uptake of new technologies and innovations. AI is unlikely to be the exception to this rule, which means Nvidia could be in for a challenging year.', 'Although Nvidia has proved me and other skeptics wrong through the first month of 2024, there are enough red flags to suggest investors should avoid Nvidia, or perhaps forget about it altogether, until its valuation makes more sense.', ""But just because Nvidia is rife with warning signs, it doesn't mean all high-growth stocks are worth avoiding. What follows are two supercharged growth stocks with far more tantalizing upside in 2024 than Nvidia."", 'The first fast-paced stock that has the tools in place to outperform Nvidia in 2024 is edge computing company Fastly (NYSE: FSLY).', ""Fastly is best-known for its content delivery network, which is tasked with moving data from the edge of the cloud to end users as quickly and securely as possible. The clear catalyst for Fastly is the expectation that content consumption will continue to climb, thus requiring ever-increasing network capacity. Since Fastly is a usage-driven business, the accelerated shift we've witnessed of data online and into the cloud following the COVID-19 pandemic is a good thing."", ""While it's not been a straight-line expansion for Fastly, many of the company's key performance indicators are moving in the right direction."", ""From the end of 2021 to the close of business in September 2023, enterprise customer count rose by 80 to 547; average enterprise customer spend increased from $704,000 to $832,000; and the company's dollar-based net expansion rate (DBNER) stayed firm between 118% and 123%. DBNER implies that existing clients are consistently spending between 18% and 23% more on a year-over-year basis, which, once again, is great news for Fastly's usage-driven operating model."", ""Another reason Fastly stock can fly is the strength of its management team. In September 2022, Todd Nightingale took over as CEO. Nightingale came over from Cisco Systems, where he developed the strategy for the company's Enterprise Networking and Cloud segment. Not only has Nightingale brought innovation to the table, but he keenly understands how to reduce costs, which is something Fastly sorely needed after larger-than-anticipated losses in 2021 and throughout most of 2022."", 'With Nightingale steering the ship, Fastly has a real opportunity to turn the corner to recurring profits this year. Considering Wall Street expects a 30% annualized earnings growth rate from Fastly over the next five years, it looks like a shoo-in to outpace Nvidia in 2024 (and beyond).', 'The second supercharged growth stock that offers significantly more upside in 2024 than Nvidia is online-services marketplace Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR).', ""If there's a knock against Fiverr, it's that the company is cyclical. Economic downturns and contractions are often associated with an increase in the unemployment rate. Since Fiverr's operating model helps connect freelancers with businesses that desire their services, a strong labor market and economy are needed."", ""But here's the thing: Recessions are historically short-lived. Since World War II ended in September 1945, there have been 12 official recessions, and none have surpassed 18 months in length. That compares to two expansions that hit the decade mark. Over longer periods, betting on the American economy to thrive has been a smart move."", ""Another macro factor working in Fiverr's favor is the changing dynamic of the labor market following the COVID-19 pandemic. Though some people have returned to the office, more workers than ever are operating remotely. This permanent shift in the workforce plays right into Fiverr's long-term growth plans."", ""One of the key differentiating factors for Fiverr is how its freelancers price their services. Whereas most competing online-service marketplaces allow freelancers to price their work at an hourly rate, Fiverr's freelancers list their tasks as an all-inclusive price. The price transparency with Fiverr is unparalleled, which is probably why spend per buyer has continually climbed."", ""But the real driving force behind Fiverr's growth is its take rate -- i.e., the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform, including fees, that it gets to keep. While key competitors are enjoying take rates in the mid-teens, Fiverr's expanded to 31.3% in the September-ended quarter."", 'Fiverr is taking a progressively bigger cut, yet its freelancer base and spend per buyer have steadily grown. This ideal recipe is expected to result in triple-digit annualized earnings growth over the next five years.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Fastly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Fastly, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Fastly wasn't one of them.

He managed George Soros' Quantum Fund at the time, and the pair reportedly pocketed a $1 billion profit on the transactions. Meanwhile, Druckenmiller ran his own hedge fund between 1981 and 2010, returning an average of 30% annually for clients."", 'Today, he manages his personal fortune through the Duquesne Family Office, which still makes a compelling case study. Druckenmiller had 39% of his $2.8 billion portfolio invested in just three stocks as of September: 14% in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), 13% in Coupang (NYSE: CPNG), and 12% in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). That level of asset allocation signals high conviction.', ""Here's what investors should know about those three stocks."", 'Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for data center accelerators, especially where artificial intelligence (AI) workloads are concerned. Analysts estimate the company accounts for 80% to 95% of chips used in AI computing. That positioning has been a substantial catalyst over the past year. Businesses are eager to experiment with generative AI, and Nvidia is ""best positioned"" to monetize the technology, according to KeyBanc analyst John Vinh.', 'However, what makes Nvidia truly formidable is its full-stack strategy. The company offers solutions at every layer of the AI stack: infrastructure, software, and services. In recent years, its data center hardware portfolio has expanded to include networking equipment and central processing units. The former is a $10 billion business, and the latter is ""ramping into a new multibillion-dollar product line next year,"" according to CEO Jensen Huang.', 'Additionally, Nvidia AI Enterprise is a suite of subscription software that streamlines the development of AI applications across various end markets, including manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and customer service. And DGX Cloud is a platform that brings together GPU-accelerated infrastructure, AI Enterprise software, and pre-trained machine learning models. With those tools, Nvidia democratizes AI for businesses of all sizes.', 'Argus analysts praised DGX Cloud, saying, ""Nvidia stands out, in our view, not only because it participates in so many parts of the dynamic AI economy, but because it has synthesized its offerings into a first-of-its-kind AI-as-a-service delivered through the cloud."" That affords the company an incredible competitive advantage.', 'Going forward, the market for AI hardware, software, and services is forecast to expand at 37% annually through 2030. Nvidia could theoretically achieve similar results during that period. In fact, Wall Street expects the company to grow revenue at 40% annually over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 33.9 times sales still seems a bit pricey. It may be prudent to keep this company on a watchlist for now. That said, investors set on owning shares should start with a very small position -- no more than 1% of their portfolios.', 'Coupang operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in South Korea, a region where Statista Market Insights estimates online retail sales will compound at 3% annually through 2028. To cement its leadership position, the company has introduced consumer-facing services like restaurant delivery (Coupang Eats), streaming content (Coupang Play), and fintech services (Coupang Pay). It has also added merchant-facing services for fulfillment, logistics, and advertising. Those adjacencies pull users into its ecosystem, strengthening the network effect.', 'Coupang hopes to replicate its success in Taiwan. The company launched its Rocket Delivery service in the Taiwanese market in late 2022, and it recently opened its second fulfillment center in the region. Management says its delivery service scaled quickly during its first year (more quickly than it did when it first launched in Korea). Additionally, as of the third quarter, management said Coupang was on pace to be the most downloaded app in the Taiwanese market in 2023.', 'Wall Street expects the company to increase sales by 12% annually over the next five years. There is undoubtedly risk baked into that figure, especially geopolitical tension in Taiwan and the capital requirements associated with operating a logistics network. But the stock trades at 1.1 times sales, a discount to the historical average of 2 times sales, and a reasonable price to pay for investors comfortable with the risks I just mentioned.', 'Microsoft has a prolific presence in enterprise software and cloud computing, so much so that its products and services can reasonably be described as the cornerstone of many organizations. Microsoft has twice as much software-as-a-service (SaaS) market share as its closest competitor, due in large part to strength in office productivity and enterprise resource planning software.', 'Additionally, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services behind Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, its market share has increased by four percentage points over the last three years to reach 23%, but AWS has remained flat at 32%. Microsoft could continue to gain share as investments in AI bear fruit.', 'Specifically, Azure has a partnership with OpenAI that positions Microsoft as the exclusive cloud provider to OpenAI and affords Azure customers exclusive access to the latest GPT large language models, the cognitive engines behind ChatGPT. Additionally, CEO Satya Nadella believes Azure offers the ""best AI infrastructure for both training and inference.""', 'Going forward, the enterprise SaaS and cloud computing markets are projected to compound at roughly 14% annually through 2030. That puts Microsoft on a glide path to double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade. In that context, its current valuation of 13.8 times sales is tolerable. Personally, I think other AI stocks offer more upside, but I would not fault investors for taking a small position in Microsoft today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Bozeman', ""Thank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results did not meet our expectations, as we continue to battle through a poor demand and pricing environment. But we made progress on a number of important initiatives, including charting our path forward. But let me address our results first. On our third quarter earnings call, we indicated that Q4 truck volumes in NAST could follow the normal seasonal pattern. And in fact, that is what occurred. Specifically, the average sequential Q4 decline in the Cass freight shipment index over the past 10 years is 2.4%. Excluding the pandemic-impacted years of 2020 and 2021, the average sequential Q4 decline was 3.7%. In Q4 of 2023, the shipment index declined 4.3% sequentially, and our combined truckload and LTL shipments declined less than the index at 3.5%. In Global Forwarding, we increased our ocean shipments on a year-over-year basis, but they were down sequentially as well, as they typically are in a fourth quarter. For the enterprise in total, the sequential declines in volume drove a 3% sequential decline in our Q4 AGP versus Q3, and this equated to $0.11 of our sequential EPS decline. Below gross profit, personnel and SG&A expenses were within the guidance ranges that we provided on our Q3 earnings call, although personnel expenses were towards the high end of our guidance range. Sequentially, Q4 personnel expenses increased due to the reduction of our incentive compensation accruals in Q3 that we didn't expect to repeat in Q4, as was explained on our Q3 earnings call. SG&A expenses were down sequentially but slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. In total, the 3.7% sequential increase in our operating expenses equated to $0.13 of sequential EPS decline. The combination of all these changes in AGP and operating expenses, some of which were expected, drove the sequential decrease in operating income. Below operating income, there were a couple of significant items that negatively impacted our financial results and ultimately drove the remaining $0.10 of sequential decline in our adjusted EPS, namely, noncash losses on foreign currency revaluation and a higher income tax rate. Later in the call, Mike will share more details on these as well as provide guidance on our 2024 operating expenses. So that addresses why our Q4 results declined sequentially versus Q3. Now I'll provide some additional details on our Q4 results in our North American Surface Transportation and Global Forwarding businesses. In our NAST truckload business, our Q4 volume declined approximately 1.5% year-over-year and 3.5% on a sequential basis. The weak demand environment in an elongated market trough, combined with excess carrier capacity, continued to result in a very competitive market. With the exception of the holiday weeks in Q4, the dry van load-to-truck ratio was around 2:1. And in the second half of the quarter was the lowest the industry has seen in the past 6 years. With this environment at play in Q4, we targeted more truckload volume in the spot market where we could capture more profit due to seasonal market tension. This led to a sequential improvement in our overall truckload AGP per load in October and November and for the quarter as a whole. Profit per load in December declined as expected, as the cost of purchased transportation moved seasonally higher. For the quarter, we had an approximate mix of 65% contractual volume and 35% transactional volume in our truckload business, compared to a 70-30 mix over the past 3 quarters. The sequential declines that we have seen in our truckload linehaul cost per mile since Q2 of 2022 continued through November of 2023 before moving seasonally higher in December. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a decline of approximately 10.5% in our average Q4 truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges. Due to the usual time lag associated with the resetting of contract pricing to follow spot market cost, our average truckload linehaul rate or price billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, declined 13.5% on a year-over-year basis. With this price decline coming off a higher base than the cost, these changes resulted in a 29.5% year-over-year decrease in AGP per load. Moving into 2024, we will substantially increase our focus on revenue management objectives to better align revenue and cost in our contractual portfolio. Arun will share more on this in a little bit, but we intend to use our advanced pricing and contract management tools and a more surgical and disciplined approach as we navigate changing market conditions in the future, with a focus on profitable growth. In our LTL business, Q4 shipments were down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis and 3.5% sequentially. AGP per order declined 8.5% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by the soft market conditions and lower fuel prices. On a sequential basis, the cost and price of purchased transportation in the LTL market increased in Q4, primarily driven by the assets and capacity that have temporarily exited the LTL market. This resulted in a 3% sequential increase in AGP per order. In our Global Forwarding business, results continue to be impacted by the imbalance of soft demand and ample capacity. In Q4, our ocean forwarding AGP declined by 17.2% year-over-year, driven by a 20.5% decrease in AGP per shipment that was partially offset by a 4% increase in shipments. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, we have grown ocean market share by providing differentiated solutions in customer service and by leveraging investments in technology and talent, leading to the addition of new customers and diversification of the verticals and trade lanes that we serve. In the wake of the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea and low water levels in the Panama Canal, global supply chains are facing transit interruptions and vessel rerouting, which is causing extended transit times and putting a strain on global ocean capacity. While the Asia-to-Europe trade lane has been most affected, the impact is extending to other lanes as carriers adjust routes based on shipping demand. As a result, ocean rates have increased sharply in Q1 on several trade lanes, including Asia to Europe and Asia to North America. While the Red Sea disruption continues without any clear time line of when it will be resolved, the strain on capacity and the elevated spot rates are expected to continue through at least the Chinese New Year. As a global logistics provider with the scale and expertise to strategize and implement contingency plans, we're highly engaged with our customers to help them navigate the evolving situation and ensure flexibility and resilience in their supply chain. At some point, we expect that ocean pricing will loosen as new vessel capacity continues to enter the market in 2024. Looking ahead, we do not see any indications of a global freight volume upturn in the immediate future. In that, similar to the fourth quarter, the first quarter is typically characterized by a sequential decrease in ground transportation volumes. In fact, the average sequential Q1 decline in the Cass freight shipment index over the past 10 years was 2.6%. As the global freight market fluctuates due to seasonal, cyclical and geopolitical factors, we remain focused on what we can control by providing superior service to our customers and carriers, streamlining our processes by removing waste and manual touches, and delivering tools that enable our customer and carrier-facing employees to allocate their time to relationship building, value-added solutioning and exception management. Our 17% improvement in NAST shipments per person per day in Q4 exceeded our stated 15% target and is an indicator of the progress that we've made on removing waste and manual touches. These efforts are also bearing fruit in other key areas of our business, as Global Forwarding achieved a 20% year-over-year improvement in their Q4 shipments per person per month. Our continued focus on productivity improvements is one part of our plan to address and optimize our enterprise-wide structural cost, and we expect to carry our productivity momentum into 2024. Our commitment to deliver quality and continuous improvement to our customers continues to be validated by Net Promoter Scores in 2023 that were the highest on record for the company, which we believe puts us in a good position with customers ahead of the eventual rebound in the freight market. Our customers continue to value the quality, stability and reliability that we provide as they work to optimize their transportation needs. They want a partner who has financial strength and the ability to invest through cycles in the customer experience. They also want a partner who can meet their increasingly complex logistics needs by providing expertise and a breadth of innovative solutions, enabled by technology and people that they can rely on to serve as an extension of their team. C.H. Robinson is that partner. With a combination of people, technology and scale to deliver an unmatched customer experience and with a breadth of capabilities to meet all their logistics needs, including value-added solutions for cross-border freight, drop trailer capacity and retail consolidation. As we continue to improve the customer experience and our cost to serve, I'm focused on ensuring that we'll be ready for the eventual freight market rebound, with a durable cost structure that decouples volume growth from head count growth and drives operating leverage. In order to further eliminate productivity bottlenecks in the highest leverage areas, we're focused on a handful of concurrent work streams that will deliver an improved customer experience through process optimization. These focused work streams are an example of how the leadership team and I have made changes to drive focus so that we position ourselves for growth in our core business. Our commitment to continuously improving the experience of our customers and carriers and eliminating inefficiencies from our processes will make us a company that is faster, more flexible and more agile in solving problems for our customers, delivering better customer service and creating operating leverage and profitable growth. I'll turn it over to Arun now to provide more details on our efforts to strengthen our customer and carrier experience and our revenue management practices and improve our efficiency and operating leverage."", 'Arun D. Rajan', ""Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave said, we continue to execute on a handful of concurrent work streams that are addressing significant opportunities to eliminate productivity bottlenecks and to deliver process optimization and an improved customer experience. Two of the work streams on the productivity road map are aimed at quoting and order entry. In both areas, we are reducing manual touches and our response time to customers, driving faster speed to market and higher customer engagement. In addition to our past learnings, we're leaning more heavily on generative AI to deliver process improvements. In our order entry work stream, we're utilizing gen AI to translate structured and unstructured e-mails, PDFs and Excel files that we receive from customers and their vendors into orders on our system. This solution fills in customer-specific requirements based on their past history and customer-specific prompts and scenarios entered by frontline teams who know the customer's business. Gen AI puts the power of large language models into the hands of our frontline teams rather than relying solely on data scientists to train models for unique customer requirements. While our preference is still to receive an order via API or other structured electronic means, there is large variability in how customer orders are transmitted. And this new method allows customers to have an interaction as though we receive their order via structured electronic means even when they choose to e-mail an order to us. With more data and history to leverage than any other 3PL, we have opportunities to harness the power that generative AI now offers to further capitalize on our information advantage. And we'll continue to look for and pursue those opportunities. Another area where we've advanced our capabilities is in touchless appointments, where we've introduced technology to automate the entire process. This technology also uses AI to determine the optimal appointment based on transit time data from our millions of shipments across 300,000 shipping lanes, facility data such as peak dwell time and the most convenient time windows for carriers. This advancement saves shippers a considerable amount of time, enables them to achieve higher service levels, and saves them money by avoiding charge-backs or fines they might face due to freight arriving too early or too late. In addition to an improved customer experience, our efforts are increasing the digital execution of critical touch points in the life cycle of an order from quote to cash, thereby reducing the number of manual tasks per shipment and the time per task. This translates to productivity improvements measured in terms of shipments per person per day, which creates operating leverage. As Dave mentioned earlier, we surpassed our 2023 goal of a 15% year-over-year improvement in NAST shipments per person per day, with 17% improvement achieved in Q4. As we deliver further process optimization and an improved customer experience, we plan to deliver the compounded cost structure benefits of additional 2024 productivity improvements of 15% in NAST and 10% in Global Forwarding, with technology that supports our people and processes. As Dave also mentioned, revenue management is a key focus for us as we navigate this difficult freight market. With continued investment in our pricing science and contract management technology over the course of 2023, we're now in a better position to respond to dynamic market conditions with the tools and capabilities we've developed. In 2024, we will increase our rigor and discipline in the application of these tools and capabilities. These tools, together with our scale, data and customer and carrier relationships, underpin our revenue management function through which we can be more surgical in how we approach customer discussions and how we implement a disciplined pricing and profitable growth strategy based on individual customer value propositions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for a review of our fourth quarter results."", 'Michael Paul Zechmeister', ""Thanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. The soft freight market outlined by Dave resulted in fourth quarter total revenues of $4.2 billion and adjusted gross profit, or AGP, of $618.6 million, which was down 20% year-over-year, driven by a 24% decline in NAST and a 14% decline in Global Forwarding. On a monthly basis, compared to Q4 of 2022, our total company AGP per business day was down 24% in October, down 20% in November, and down 13% in December. Turning to expenses. Q4 personnel expenses were $361.8 million, including a $1.3 million favorable restructuring charge adjustment, primarily driven by the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso prior to completing the divestiture of our Global Forwarding operations in Argentina. Excluding these reversals, our Q4 personnel expenses of $363.2 million were down 10.5% year-over-year, primarily due to our cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation. Our average Q4 head count was down 13.3% year-over-year, including double-digit decreases in NAST, Global Forwarding and our All Other and Corporate segments. Ending head count was down 12.4% year-over-year to 15,246. As Dave mentioned, the sequential increase in our Q4 personnel expenses was included in our guidance. Although Q4 personnel expenses were within our guidance range, they came in at the higher end due to the achievement of certain objective bonus targets, for example, delivering results on cost reduction initiatives. Moving to SG&A. Q4 expenses were $149.4 million, including a $2.9 million reversal of restructuring charges also driven by the peso deflation prior to completing the divestiture of our Global Forwarding operations in Argentina. Excluding the reversal, SG&A expenses were $152.3 million, a decline of 5.8% year-over-year, primarily due to reductions in contingent worker expenses, and were down 2.6% sequentially. As you recall from our Q1 earnings call in April, we raised our cost savings commitment to $300 million from $150 million, which was defined as the net annualized cost savings by Q4 of 2023 compared to the annualized run rate of Q3 of 2022, which is when the commitment was originally made. With the progress on our 2023 productivity initiatives, we delivered $346 million in cost savings for the full year, excluding restructuring charges, with the majority of these savings expected to be long-term structural changes. Consistent with our strategy, we believe these cost savings will improve our operating leverage and help our margins as demand and a more balanced freight market return. Turning to our 2024 annual operating expense guidance. We expect our personnel expenses to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. At the midpoint, this is up 0.2% compared to our 2023 total of $1.447 billion, excluding restructuring charges. The personnel expense drivers in 2024 include 2 items that are expected to offset each other. The restoration of target incentive compensation related to the expected improvement in financial performance will be offset by continued productivity improvements across the business and lower head count as the team continues to decouple volume growth and head count growth. 2024 SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million, down 0.8% at the midpoint, excluding the restructuring charges in 2023. This includes 2024 depreciation and amortization expense that is expected to be $90 million to $100 million. Although most of our SG&A expenses are subject to inflation, we expect continued cost reduction efforts to offset the inflationary impact. Shifting to expenses below operating income. Our Q4 interest and other expense totaled $38.1 million, which was down $4.3 million or 10.1% year-over-year. Q4 included $21.6 million of interest expense, which was down $3.1 million or 12.6% versus Q4 of 2022, driven by $394 million of debt reduction compared to Q4 of 2022. Another factor that drove Q4 other expense was an $18.5 million loss on foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses, which is compared to a $16.9 million loss in Q4 of 2022. The Q4 loss was driven primarily by weakness in the Argentine peso and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. As a reminder, our FX impacts are predominantly noncash gains and losses related to intercompany assets and liabilities. On a sequential basis, FX had an unfavorable impact of $18.4 million and included an $8.9 million loss related to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso prior to exiting the business in late December. As you recall from our third quarter earnings call, operating in Argentina had become challenging due to its strict monetary policies and currency devaluation. The divestiture mitigates our exposure to the deteriorating economic conditions and the increasing political instability in that region. As a part of the divesting of our operations in Argentina, we converted the business to a local independent agent to ensure continued service to our customers with shipments in that region. There were also a couple of large onetime tax-related items that impacted our results in Q4. Our Q4 tax provision of $38.3 million included a tax settlement of $19.2 million and $4.7 million of tax expense related to the Argentina divestiture. In regard to the tax settlement, the company came to an agreement with the IRS Appeals division on a tax position related to tax incentives for domestic investments in the years 2014 through 2017. Although we maintain that our software investments were supportable deductions, we were only offered a partial settlement. Factoring in cost of litigation, expert advice and that other companies who have challenged similar positions have experienced unfavorable results, we decided it was in our best interest to settle the issue. The company has no ongoing financial exposure relating to this specific deduction, as it was eliminated from the tax code beginning in 2018. Excluding these onetime tax expenses, our effective tax rate came in at 19.5% for the quarter and 15.0% for the year, compared to 19.3% in 2022. Our lower tax rate in 2023 was primarily driven by our -- by lower pretax income and incremental benefits from foreign tax credits. We expect our 2024 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%. Q4 adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 excludes $23.9 million of onetime tax expenses, $8.9 million of foreign currency losses on divested Argentina operations, and the $4.3 million reversal of restructuring charges. Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow generated by operations was $47 million compared to $773 million in Q4 of 2022. The year-over-year decline in cash flow was primarily driven by changes in net operating working capital. In Q4 of 2022, we had a $650 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital, driven by the sharply declining cost and price of purchased transportation. In Q4 of 2023, we had a $7 million sequential increase in net operating working capital. In Q4, our capital expenditures were $16.1 million compared to $27.8 million in Q4 of 2022. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be $85 million to $95 million. We returned $74 million of cash to shareholders in Q4, which was down 85% year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in cash from operations. Now on to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with approximately $1.0 billion of liquidity, comprised of $840 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $146 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q4 was $1.6 billion, which was down $394 million since the end of 2022. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 2.34x, up from 2.10x at the end of Q3, driven by the lower EBITDA. Our capital allocation strategy is grounded in maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which allows us to optimize our weighted average cost of capital. Our $619 million in debt pay-downs since Q3 of 2022 has helped maintain our strong liquidity position and investment-grade credit rating. Keep in mind that the cash that we use to reduce debt generally reduced the amount of cash for share repurchases. Overall, I'm encouraged by the much-needed progress that was made on our 2023 productivity initiatives and the plans in place to build on that progress in 2024. With the 17% productivity improvement delivered in NAST and the 20% productivity improvement in Global Forwarding in 2023, combined with an expectation of an additional 15% in NAST and 10% in Global Forwarding in 2024, each business is expected to deliver compounded productivity improvements of 32% or better over the 2-year period. A robust pipeline of process technology and waste elimination initiatives continues to be acted upon. By leveraging generative AI combined with machine learning to take the capability of our people to an even higher level, Robinson is positioned well to further reduce waste and drive structural cost changes that improve our operating leverage and help deliver on the long-term operating income margin expectations. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his final comments."", 'David P. Bozeman', ""Thanks, Mike. We share the sentiment of some of our peers in that we're happy to say goodbye to 2023. And although 2024 still presents some of the same challenges and headwinds, I'm excited about the work that we're doing to reinvigorate Robinson's winning culture. Over my first 6 months here, I completed my initial diagnosis, and we're taking actions to chart our path forward. At a high level, we need to focus on both our customer value proposition and revenue generation and our structural cost, and we need to aggressively seek the optimal balance. Let's review my findings. First, our structural cost base grew too much during the pandemic, and we made significant progress on reducing that cost structure in 2023. But it needs to continue to improve. We will do that by embedding lean practices, removing waste and expanding our digital capabilities. This will enable us to strengthen our productivity and optimize our organization's structure in order to be the most efficient operator in addition to the highest value provider. Second, as I listen to our customers, it's clear that their logistics needs are becoming increasingly complex, and robust capabilities are required to power vertical-centric and value-added solutions. I have found that C.H. Robinson has people with deep expertise in the freight market and long-standing trusted relationships with our customers and carriers. This is a competitive advantage, but we can do a better job of leveraging our unique expertise and information advantage and advance our cutting-edge technology to deliver more robust capabilities and market-leading outcomes. Third, we need to focus on profitable growth in our 4 core modes, North American truckload and LTL and global ocean and air, as the engines to ignite growth by reclaiming share in eroded segments and expanding our addressable market through value-added services and solutions that drive new volume to the core modes. And fourth, we need to drive better synergies across our portfolio of services to accelerate profitable growth. One way that we're going to do this is by improving how we go to market as one company with unified account management versus showing up as distinct business units. Our journey to unlock the power of our portfolio is underway as we take action on all of these fronts. One example of this is the recent launching of our Enterprise Strategy Program Management office and the addition of Jim Reutlinger to the senior leadership team to lead our strategic approach to our critical planning activities. Jim is an expert in continuous improvement and lean methodology, and he brings learnings from his leadership experience at Danaher, a company with a well-established reputation for continuous improvement. Jim will help us drive lean principles and continuous improvement deeper into the organization and create growth and success in our strategic priorities. I continue to see an opportunity for the company to reach its full potential and create more shareholder value by improving our value proposition, increasing our market share, accelerating growth, further reducing our structural cost, and improving our efficiency, operating margins and profitability. I'm confident that together, we will win for our customers, carriers, employees and shareholders, and I'm incredibly excited about our future. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to Donna now for the Q&A portion of the call."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan.', 'Brian Patrick Ossenbeck', ""Dave, maybe I can just ask you to give a little more context around the rationale of pivoting more to the spot market. You've been running a little bit harder in contracts longer. So just wanted to see what the -- what changed in terms of why you went that route. And then maybe tying on to that, the revenue management focus things could be really important, especially given we all know what happens when the market recovers, contracts get squeezed. Last cycle, Robinson had a pretty big headwind from negative files. So I wanted to hear if this new focus was potentially going to limit that eventuality as you see the market turn."", 'David P. Bozeman', ""Brian, I'm going to have Arun jump in and address your question. Thanks for the question, by the way."", 'Arun D. Rajan', ""Yes, Brian. I think the way we look at it is it's opportunistic, right? I mean, where the -- where we can get profitable demand, we'll go. And there was an opportunity in the spot market, so we went there.As it relates to revenue management, ultimately, as you know, the market is soft, and so it's a very, very competitive environment. And then the reality is, I think everybody is in this situation where prices are low, costs are also low. And I think what we have to think about, from a revenue management perspective, is sort of the short term and the long term. I mean, there's 2 different perspectives, right?And so seasonally, we expect around the holidays cost to go up and then settle back down. What's different this year is the winter storms and such have kept costs a bit elevated. But regardless, in the short term, we have contracts, we have commitments. And based on our revenue management objectives, our value proposition to the customer and certain customer attributes, we make a determination on when we reprice certain targeted lanes.In the short term, we don't see an inflection in the market. So we're not really triggering any major repricing other than making sure our -- we're trying to grab as much volume as we can in the spot market. But the revenue management sort of discipline will really kick in if there's a true sustained inflection in the market, and we don't quite see that yet."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Jack Atkins of Stephens Inc.', 'Jack Lawrence Atkins', ""Okay. Great. First, Mike, I just want to say, I really enjoyed working with you, and congratulations as you move on to the next phase of your career.I guess, a lot of different ways we could go with this. I guess, I would love to get your thoughts on just broadly the first quarter. We've had -- Arun, to your point, things have tightened up here in January with the winter storms. We've seen some volatility in the global forwarding markets as well. How does that impact -- how has that impacted your business through January? Are you seeing AGP get squeezed a bit? Could you maybe walk us through what you're seeing in the business so far this year?"", 'Arun D. Rajan', ""Sort of building on my response to Brian, January, we have this -- I think we all know this. There's a seasonal cost increase as capacity comes out of the market for the holidays. We expect that to generally settle down by the second week of January or latest by mid-January. And we haven't seen that. Well, we've seen that in markets that are not affected by adverse weather. But where there has been weather storms that were unexpectedly -- that were just unexpected or worse than what was expected, what we're seeing is a lot of cost pressure and, essentially, capacity pressure, increased load-to-truck ratios, increased cost per mile in those markets.Now we're starting to see that ease up and dissipate as the weather sort of dissipates. And so from our perspective, everything that we see in the data suggests that any cost increases that we saw in January are purely a function of weather. Because like I said, we see that weather-impacted areas have this capacity strain versus non-weather-impacted regions. So -- but as these storms dissipate and cost per mile comes back down, I think we're back to where we expected this year to be in terms of costs.And so in terms of revenue management and how we think about that, in the short term, we could make a decision to go reprice customers. But the idea is to honor commitments so long as changes in the costs are short term. However, if we see that this sustains, our revenue management will kick in. And based on sort of our revenue management objectives, the value we provide customers and customer attributes, we will have to do targeted repricing."", 'Jack Lawrence Atkins', ""Okay. Got it. And then, Arun, could you maybe touch on the Global Forwarding side of it as well? Just because there's been volatility there too."", 'Michael Paul Zechmeister', ""Jack, I'll chime in on that. And first of all, thanks for your comments. I appreciate it. The feeling is mutual.Yes. Just before I go into ocean, just maybe add a comment on the truck side. And I think one point to be made about where we're at in the AGP that's coming in for us, both in Q4 and then into January, is the emphasis on the point about this elongated trough and its impact on our contract business in particular. And if you look at cycles from the past that aren't as prolonged, as you're coming down and then coming back up, the older contracts that you have in your portfolio still have higher pricing.One of the differences here is this elongated trough has caused time to pass such that we've repriced pretty much our entire portfolio. So what's different is we have more contracts now at current market price than we would normally have at this point in the cycle. And that's suppressing the margin even with normal activity underneath. And it's really just a mechanical reflection of an elongated trough. So I just wanted to throw that in there also.Then over on the ocean side, yes, a lot going on there. Obviously, you read about what's going on in the Red Sea. We've got the water depth issues in Panama Canal. And that has caused a lot of the capacity to be rerouted, which I think we would consider to be a temporary capacity disruption on the ocean side, which has really led to some increased pricing, both at the end of Q4 and then into January in the marketplace.I don't think that we see that as being demand driven at this point, and it's really probably a temporary capacity disruption. So I think after we get past Chinese New Year and with the additional capacity that's also coming in, in 2024, I think you'll see some kind of normalization there.The other point I'd make on ocean is that the composition of that business from contract to spot is very different than what we have in truckload. In fact, on the ocean side, we're only about 20% contract as opposed to what we were quoting on the truckload side at 65%. So that's just another difference to keep in mind. And that means we're able to benefit from the increased spot market in ocean and more immediately than we are on the truckload side."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Jon Chappell of Evercore ISI.', 'Jonathan B. Chappell', ""So clearly, this tough market has had an impact on others as well, those that are not as well as financially secure as C.H. Robinson is. We've seen some bigger names go out of business. I'm just wondering now, as this elongated market reaches almost the third year, are you seeing any desperation in some of the newer or maybe even established competitors out there that's creating an even more either volatile or kind of punitive pricing environment? And if so, what's the opportunities and risks to you in that type of backdrop?"", 'Michael Paul Zechmeister', ""Let me take a cut at that. So you're right, it is a very stressed market. And one of the things that we believe may be an advantage to us in this stressed market is that we're still investing. We're still putting our money down on the pipeline of projects that we intended to do. In fact, as we try to increase clock speed, we're doing some of those projects concurrently. And so while others may be looking to cut -- to kind of hang in there, weather the storm, we're continuing to make ourselves better with the idea that when we emerge, the inevitable turn here, we'll be stronger as we come out.I wouldn't comment on anybody specifically in there in the pinched front. But boy, we certainly hear about it. We see it. The implications out there are clear, given where we've been and how long we've been there."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Chris Wetherbee of Citi.', 'Christian F. Wetherbee', ""It looks like from a cost perspective, if you think about 2024, that you're guiding OpEx to be roughly flattish year-over-year. I think you guys have also said that you're not necessarily expecting a freight rebound coming in 2024, at least as far as you can see in the relative near term. So I guess I was just trying to square that up. Obviously, you guys have added a lot of costs for COVID, Dave, as you noted. So as you think about sort of the opportunity here, is flat enough for 2024? And maybe you can help us get some perspective on what the longer term might look like on a cost basis."", 'Michael Paul Zechmeister', ""Yes. Chris, let me take a cut at that. So -- appreciate the question. There are some offsetting things going on here. One is that we've got restoration of our incentive in 2024 and we've got normal inflation that's hitting, and so we're offsetting that. And to break it down and just be a little more specific about your question, on the personnel side, the midpoint of our guidance is up 0.2% versus where we landed in 2023 ex restructuring. And on the SG&A side, we're down 0.8% at the midpoint versus where we landed ex restructuring in 2023. But we absolutely have to improve our cost structure. We continue on that path. The productivity numbers that we generated, the 17% in NAST and 20% in GF, as you heard, continue into 2024. 15% on NAST and another 10% on GF.So we're talking about over 30% on a compound basis in both businesses here over the 2-year period. So the efforts continue. We do expect some rebound in the market so that we'll have some volume pickup there as well. But we've got to continue to head down the path that we've been on."", 'David P. Bozeman', ""Yes. Chris, just to add on to what Mike said, we're also looking at this too, as we said before, is really position ourselves to be in a strong pole position for the market rebound. And we feel good about where we're headed there. Best data we have is back half of this year, if we start seeing that inflection, we're driving our cost structure to have really that operating leverage put us in a great position as well as continue to go after structural costs while creating that balance.So I feel really good about that and the things that we're putting in place to drive that. So thanks for the question."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies.', 'Stephanie Lynn Benjamin Moore', ""Was hoping that you could maybe touch a little bit on what you're seeing on the kind of bid environment, where it stands today, and how it's been trending and those conversations have been going? And on the other side, I would love to get your thoughts on what you're seeing in terms of capacity exits. I think we all are pretty aware of what's going on, on the demand side. But capacity exits have been much slower for the last year, so would love to hear your thoughts on kind of where that stands today."", 'Arun D. Rajan', ""In terms of bids, there's a variety. Customers come in their own forms, and there are different customers with different approaches. A lot of customers want resilient pricing in their contracts. So meaning, like they know the market is going to turn at some point and they want to price some of that prediction in, such that the contract doesn't have to be repriced. Whereas others want to be more aggressive and want us to quote based on what the market looks like today, understanding that none of us have a crystal ball. So there's a variety of contracts and a variety of customers in terms of the bid environment.Having said that, the way we approach pricing any of these contracts is obviously a combination of our revenue management objectives, the attributes of the customer, including things like their customer lifetime value and so on. And finally, the value proposition that we deliver. So on balance, we have to consider all those things in terms of how we respond based on what the customer is asking for, such that we can sustain through the contract in a way that meets our objectives.And in terms of capacity coming out of the market, Mike, do you want to take that?"", 'Michael Paul Zechmeister', ""Yes. Sure, Stephanie, I'll cover that.So one of the interesting differences in this cycle has been the delay in the capacity on the truckload coming out. But the good news is we are starting to see that kind of normal behavior, the capacity coming out. There's a little bit of momentum in that space. It hasn't significantly impacted pricing yet, but we expect that to come.Just by way of example, one of the things that we track is new carrier sign-ups. Last year, we were about 9,100 in Q4. And we're about half of that, a little less than half of that, here in this past Q4. So I would expect that to continue. When you think about on the ocean side, I think it's a little bit different story, where there'll probably be a net capacity increase in '24 on the ocean side."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners.', 'Jeffrey Asher Kauffman', ""I want to revisit David's assessment and in particular, the focus on the core 4. Is there an implication here that we're applying the 80/20 rule, and those are the 4 businesses that we really want to drive? Or is the implication here that we're going to simplify the structure at Robinson? And if you're not part of the core 4, then eventually that might not be a business we're in, in the long run?"", 'David P. Bozeman', ""Yes, let me double-click on that a little bit more here. The implication as we're looking forward is about what you said the first time. It's about focus for where we want to go. Our focus for this company is truckload, LTL, ocean and air. And that doesn't mean -- I mean, we have a lot of other feeder type of businesses that will help to drive the growth of those key businesses that I spoke of. And that's really what our focus is going to be about. Now you've got to always look at things and evaluate them and say what's the best for the company from an operational perspective and long term. But focus is about really truckload and it's about LTL, ocean, air, and maximizing the feed of those particular businesses. So that's really where I'm doing -- and I'm constantly evaluating the entire company on that."", 'Operator', 'The last question today is coming from Bruce Chan of Stifel.', 'Jizong Chan', ""Dave, you talked about one of your big findings. I think it was #4 as being the opportunity to drive some better synergies across the portfolio. Maybe if you could just talk about how many of your customers today are using multiple service lines and where that number could go? Or if you're thinking about that in a different way, like what the revenue synergy opportunity could be? I'd love to get some color on that, too."", 'David P. Bozeman', ""Today, if you look at that, let's just focus on our 2 largest businesses, which really kind of drive overall for Robinson, in NAST and Global Forwarding.We track today our customers. Half of our customers use essentially both NAST and Global Forwarding services are driven by half. So what we're looking at is that the opportunity there, while that's good, we think that there is an opportunity for more wallet share than we have there by unlocking the potential of those services.And as I look at this, showing up in a more synergistic fashion, which is something that I noticed going forward, our customers really want that. They want solutions to complicated problems that they have in their supply chain. We can offer that. And I think that separates us out. But showing up as kind of a la carte or individual solutions, I think while we're generating some value there, there's more value we get by really showing up as a suite of services to solve more complicated, deeper issues for the customer. And that's why we're focusing on that. We have good momentum and energy around that, and we have some structured things that we're doing already within the company to drive and unlock some of that value."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from David Vernon of Bernstein.', 'David Scott Vernon', ""Just a quick question. It doesn't sound like we're given any sort of explicit guidance for the year, which I totally understand and respect given the uncertainty that's out there. But I'd love your thoughts on whether sort of the exit rate of fourth quarter here is kind of as bad as it gets. Or do we expect it to get a little rockier? And then any thoughts on how we can translate the productivity numbers you guys are giving us in terms of 32% compound into profitability?"", 'Michael Paul Zechmeister', ""So I would say a couple of things on that. We have a history of giving you expense guidance across the business. So we give you personnel, SG&A, CapEx, depreciation and amortization, tax rate, but we don't give AGP and that's really because of the volatility that we all experience in this business and the difficulty in predicting the macro demand and capacity elements that drive the pricing there. So we've tried to stay away from that.And part and parcel to that, to your question about, we're here in the trough, how long does the trough last? When do we come out of it? We provide some guidance on our website about where we think pricing is going. But again, we're doing our best to forecast where we're at, but those things are very difficult to know with certainty. And so kind of the same element there of the comments that we've made, I think, are back half of the year is when things start to really turn around in truck."", 'Operator', ""Thank you.

His predecessor, Mac Pinkerton, was said by C.H. Robinson to be “transitioning from his current role.”', 'Castagnetto had been vice president of customer success at NAST. Prior to that, he was president of Robinson Fresh, a leading delivery service of fresh food. He joined the company in 2005.', 'In the latest earnings report, NAST revenues were just over $3 billion for the quarter, down 15.8% from a year ago.

However, in December, our profit per load declined as the cost of purchased transportation moved seasonally higher.”', 'Bozeman said truckload business at C.H.

Where we can get profitable demand, we’ll go, and there was opportunity in the spot market. So we went there.”', 'Rajan said the shift was part of “revenue management” and not a sign of a longer-term shift. “In the short term, we don’t see an inflection in the market,” Rajan said. “So we’re not really triggering any major repricing other than making sure we are trying to grab as much volume as we can in the spot market.” Changes could be made if that inflection develops, Rajan said, “but we don’t quite see that yet.”', 'One area where changes have had an impact is employee expenses. In the North American Surface Transportation sector at C.H. Robinson, the company said it had cut its operating expenses by 16.3%, “primarily due to cost optimization efforts, including lower average employee headcount, lower variable compensation, and lower technology expenses.” The average head count was 15.8% less than a year earlier.', 'Better productivity numbers reported', 'Bozeman has spoken frequently about a push to increase productivity rather than just waiting around for the freight market to bolster C.H. Robinson’s performance. He cited a 17% improvement in the North American Surface Transportation’s group shipments per person per day, which exceeded the goal of a 15% jump “as an indicator of the progress that we’ve made on removing waste and manual touches.”', 'Asked about the current market past the end of the quarter, Rajan said there had been some tightness in truckload capacity in areas that had been hit by the cold snap of January. The load-to-truck ratio increased the cost per mile in those markets, he said, but “now we’re starting to see that ease up and dissipate as the weather sort of dissipates.”', '“From our perspective, everything that we see in the data suggests that any cost increases we saw in January are purely a function of weather.”', 'CFO Mike Zechmeister, answering an analyst’s question about the strength of C.H. Robinson relative to other 3PLs, said “it is a very stressed market. And one of the things that we believe may be an advantage to use in this stressed market is that we’re still investing.” Zechmeister said when the “inevitable” market improvement comes, “we’ll be stronger as we come out.”', 'Zechmeister’s retirement is set for May 31 at the latest. His successor has not been named.', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'Norfolk Southern’s weak Q4, deteriorating OR draw Wall Street criticism', 'Love’s: Restraint in new travel centers/truck parking in ’24 but larger growth plans', 'EBITDA at TriumphPay, its key metric, turned positive in Q4', 'The post C.H.

In addition to those seven rigs, super-specs were contracted for work in both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.', '“This additional Bahrain rig, as well as the Saudi Arabia rig awarded in August of ’23, should both start sometime in the summer of 2024.

Additionally, throughout 2023, we benefited from $31 billion in net inflows into our Index products, which represents a strong starting point for 2024. In the fourth quarter, we also saw early signs of normalization in sales cycles for our IR and asset owner solutions. And lastly, market volumes are off to a solid start in the new year and client interest in our comprehensive suite of technology solutions remains very strong. Turning to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, Nasdaq crossed the $1 billion mark in net revenues for the first time in a single quarter, achieving revenues of $1.1 billion. This is a 23% increase compared to the prior year period and a 7% increase on an organic basis. We delivered 9% organic growth across our Solutions businesses during the quarter while Market Services was flat. For the full year, net revenues of $3.9 billion increased 9% from 2022 or 5% on an organic basis. Solutions generated 7% organic -- annual organic revenue growth, which is consistent with our overall Solutions revenue outlook despite a dynamic market environment. Our Market Services revenue were flat year-over-year, primarily due to continued muted volumes in Europe on the back of strong performance in 2022. Our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, ended the year at $2.6 billion, an organic increase of 6% year-over-year. The slower IPO environment, as well as lower buying activity by corporates for our IR solutions, contributed to a more modest growth in ARR in 2023. Annualized SaaS revenues increased to $910 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding Adenza, this represented a 12% growth rate and 38% of total company ARR. Across the company, we accomplished revenue growth and business expansion while maintaining our operating margin at 52% for both the quarter and the full year basis, excluding Adenza. Our strong performance in 2023 illustrates the strength of our diversified business and ability to deliver against our longer-term objectives in an unpredictable environment. We did this while taking an important strategic step in Nasdaq's evolution. On November 1, we were pleased to complete the Adenza acquisition, and we are now working as one team to further our clients' goals for risk management and regulatory reporting excellence. Reflecting on the past year, I'm extremely proud of Nasdaq's team's accomplishments. With the establishment of our divisional structure and the Adenza acquisition, 2023 was a transformational year for our business. Throughout the year, we achieved several major milestones to deepen our client relationships and advance our vision to be the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. Now let's review the highlights of our operational accomplishments and client successes by division, starting with Capital Access Platforms. As you know, at Nasdaq, our exchanges are our foundation. We maintained our position as the premier U.S. exchange for IPOs with an 81% U.S. operating company win rate in 2023. In total, we welcomed 103 operating company IPOs that raised more than $11 billion in proceeds, marking Nasdaq's fifth consecutive year as the leading U.S. listing exchange in terms of both number of IPOs and proceeds raised. In addition, 18 companies representing $377 billion in market value switched their listings to Nasdaq during the year. In Index, we had $31 billion of net inflows for the year, including $10 billion in the fourth quarter. Our clients want -- our clients launched 83 new products linked to Nasdaq indices during the year, bringing to market robust solutions in line with investor demand. Beyond our exchange and index leadership, we are a leading source of institutional intelligence to the buy side through eVestment and have continued to expand our offering into alternatives and ESG. We continue to broaden our ESG solutions in 2023, launching multiple new offerings to help corporates and investors navigate an evolving ESG ecosystem, including Nasdaq Metrio and eVestment ESG Analytics. We also introduced a suite of new solutions designed to help corporate clients drive governance excellence and accelerate their ESG strategies, including Sustainable Lens through IR Insight. Turning to the Fintech division. With the completion of our Adenza acquisition, we have created a financial technology powerhouse of anti-financial crime, surveillance, market technology and risk and regulatory reporting solutions that positions us as a key risk management partner to the global financial system. Our Calypso solution helps financial institutions navigate a range of market conditions, providing a live view of risk across proprietary and client trading portfolios with detailed analytics to support real-time risk management decision-making. Similarly, in an increasingly complex and fragmented global regulatory environment, where risks need to be managed in shorter timelines at a granular level, our AxiomSL solution enables our clients to benefit from the Nasdaq's global scale and expertise. We now can be a comprehensive partner to banks, brokers, financial market infrastructure providers and investment managers worldwide by helping them maximize their liquidity through world-class capital markets and risk management technology as well as by enhancing integrity across the banking system through our regulatory reporting and anti-financial crime suite of solutions. With the closing of Adenza, we're fully focused on engaging with our clients and new employees to ensure a smooth and successful transition and integration. Tal Cohen, Nasdaq's Co-President and leader of the Fintech division, and I, have personally been speaking with our clients over the past few months, and there's a lot of excitement around the potential opportunities now that Adenza is part of Nasdaq. Adenza finished the year with strong sales and upsells across its solutions. Specifically, in the last 2 months, we signed 6 new clients, including 2 central banks. We also expanded our relationships with 35 existing clients. For the full year, Adenza added 23 new clients and expanded our relationships with 142 existing clients, including 3 cross-sells. We are thrilled to enter 2024 with Adenza as part of Nasdaq, and we're very excited to drive the business and the solutions to new heights in the years ahead. Turning to Market Technology. In 2023, we bolstered our global client footprint with addition of 7 clients, including 4 in the fourth quarter. We also expanded our relationships with 4 clients in the fourth quarter and more than 10 clients for the full year. Importantly, we had key technology client signings in APAC and in the LatAm regions. We are proud to forge new technology partnership with nuam exchange, which is the consolidation of marketplaces across Peru, Chile and Colombia. We also expanded our relationship with Chile's central securities depository with capabilities manage digitized assets and with B3 in Brazil to develop a new clearing solution, and with BMV in Mexico to modernize its entire post-trade technology platform. Our growing customer relationships highlight the importance of the financial technology we provide, which powers resilient and liquid markets around the world. In our anti-financial crime suite of solutions, we're bringing world-leading technology, coupled with our consortium data set from 2,500 banks, to fight the growing threat of financial crime in the global financial system. Our inaugural Global Financial Crime Report, which was conducted in partnership with outside experts, estimates that over $3 trillion of illicit funds flows through the global financial system and $500 billion is lost to fraud. It's an enormous challenge that requires collective action across the banking sector, the public sector and the embrace of advanced technology. We are very proud of our role in fighting financial crime, and we're finding tremendous opportunity to continue to expand our capabilities across the banking sector. In 2023, we reached a significant milestone in our anti-financial crime growth strategy. During the year, Verafin, our fraud and AML solution, signed its first three Tier 1 banks as well as four Tier 2 banks, including one Tier 1 client and one Tier 2 client in the fourth quarter. We also partnered with a growing number of small and medium-sized financial institutions for a total of 237 new clients this year and 100 for the fourth quarter alone. Additionally, we developed our first proprietary Verafin Gen AI copilot, which is now in beta with our customers. Our Gen AI tools reduce time and resources spent on manual tasks and processes, such as alert reviews, research and documentation. By increasing their operational efficiency, Verafin enables our clients to invest in resilient growth at an attractive ROI. In Surveillance, we signed 27 new clients in 2023, including 6 in the fourth quarter. We made significant strides in modernizing our solutions by launching a new cloud-based architecture and capabilities within surveillance user interfaces. These innovations give our clients the ability to calibrate their surveillance setup more efficiently and effectively. Today, 50% of our Nasdaq Trade Surveillance clients leverage our cloud-deployed solutions, which support access to 200 sophisticated alerts across more than 160 markets globally. As we continue to enhance our surveillance capabilities, we're encouraged by the early adoption of our next-gen cloud architecture and new user interfaces. Moving on Market Services. In the fourth quarter, we maintained our strong 72% market share for our cash equities markets in the Nordics against a challenging volume environment across the European markets. We've also continued to demonstrate a leading market position in the U.S. equities and options markets. In the fourth quarter, we benefited from robust closing cross volumes from the S&P, MSCI and our own Nasdaq rebalance events, and we continue to experience growing adoption of our NDX index options product. Additionally, we continue to advance the modernization of markets with the successful migration of our second U.S. options market to the AWS cloud infrastructure and with the SEC approval of the first AI-powered order type called Dynamic M-ELO, which we expect to launch in the first quarter of 2024. Altogether, we're moving with speed while delivering revenue growth and an attractive margin profile that will drive shareholder value. With the year ahead now in focus, I'd like to share our enterprise priorities for 2024. Our first priority is to continue the successful integration of Adenza. We've made great progress in the initial phase of the integration and remain confident in our ability to deliver on the goals that we laid out at the time of the deal. Second, we're accelerating the impact of our divisional structure to activate and unlock new opportunities that will drive our business into the future. Over the past year, we've delivered significant progress across each of our business divisions and we will continue to realize the benefits of this structure in 2024. Third, we are institutionalizing client listening across the company to unlock revenue growth through a One Nasdaq approach to our client engagements. In 2024, we have a focused program to organize our client data, advance our CRM and other related systems, and enhance our processes across the enterprise to gain a holistic understanding of our clients with the goal to drive partnerships and cross-selling opportunities going forward. And fourth, we will further amplify the impact that AI has on the business and in our products. Nasdaq is leveraging several critical components to ensure AI is implemented safely, securely and fairly. And through our focus on AI, coupled with the vast proprietary data sets that we've created over decades in our markets and in our solutions covering investment analytics, investor relations and anti-financial crime, we're confident that we can extend Nasdaq's competitive advantage in the years ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these priorities at Investor Day and in the quarters to come. To wrap up, 2023 was another year defined by significant strategic and operational milestones and strong execution. As we look ahead to 2024, we're well positioned to better serve our clients more holistically as we become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review our financial details."", 'Sarah M. Youngwood', ""Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled to be here for my first earnings call at Nasdaq. I could not be more excited to join the firm at such a transformational time, and I look forward to seeing many of you at Investor Day. Now I will turn to our financial results. My commentary will be focused on non-GAAP results, and the year-on-year growth rates will be provided on an organic basis. Similarly, operating margins will be discussed ex-Adenza for comparability purposes. I will discuss the Adenza standalone results at the end of the Fintech section. Before we move to the quarter, I would like to give you the highlights for the full year 2023, starting on Slide 12 of the earnings presentation. In an uncertain environment, we delivered solid financial performance and strong cash flow generation. Revenue of $3.9 billion was up 5%, with Solutions revenue of $2.9 billion, an increase of 7%; non-GAAP expense was $1.8 billion, up 5%, in line with guidance; for a 52% operating margin which was flat versus the prior year. This resulted in diluted EPS of $2.82, reflecting organic growth of 6%. We had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, a growth rate of 11%. Moving on to the fourth quarter on Slide 13. We reported revenue of $1.1 billion, up 7%, with Solutions revenue of $860 million, an increase of 9%. Non-GAAP expense was $504 million, up 2% and with an operating margin of 52%, up 3 percentage points. Overall, this resulted in diluted EPS of $0.72, reflecting organic growth of 11%. Turning to Slide 14. ARR totaled $2.6 billion, up 6% organically. The annualized SaaS revenue totaled $910 million, representing organic growth of 12%. Excluding Adenza, SaaS was 38% of ARR, an improvement of 2 percentage points. Including Adenza, that number is 35%, which will improve as the cloud portion of their revenue increases. As a reminder, we only consider the cloud portion of their revenue to be SaaS. Let's review division results for the quarter, starting on Slide 15. For Capital Access Platforms, revenue of $461 million increased 10%, driven by excellent performance in Index. In Data and Listing Services, we saw 3% growth. In Data, we have seen a continued increase in proprietary data revenues, driven largely by higher international demand. In Listings, the positive impact of pricing was partially offset by the combined impact of delistings, a muted IPO environment and the roll-off of prior year's initial listings revenue. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 3%. Analytics delivered high single-digit growth, reflecting our ability to monetize the value of our data to the buy side with new business and increased pricing across traditional and alternative asset managers. The strength in Analytics was partially offset by a weaker capital raising market and the impact of elongated sales cycle in Corporate Solutions. Index revenue increased 26% and overall AUM grew by 34%. Over the last 12 months, our net inflows were $31 billion, $10 billion of which occurred during the fourth quarter. Licensing revenues for futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index increased as well, driven by higher capture, partially offset by a decline in trading volumes. As a reminder, our capture increases once we cross a volume threshold and then resets at the beginning of each year. While smaller in size, Index revenue also benefited from Index data revenue growth. ARR for Capital Access Platforms was $1.2 billion, up 3%. ARR growth was largely driven by Analytics and to a lesser extent Data and Listings. The muted IPO environment impacted ARR growth. However, we are cautiously optimistic that we could see a recovery in IPOs, combined with more normalized sales cycles as we progress through 2024. As a reminder, substantially all of Index revenue is excluded from ARR. The division's operating margin was 54% for the quarter, an increase of 4 percentage points due to higher revenues. For the full year, it was 55%, up roughly 50 basis points. The increase was driven by higher revenues, partially offset by inflation, revenue-related expense and investments in particular across Data and Index. Moving to Financial Technology on Slide 16. The division delivered revenue of $399 million for the quarter, up 8%. Regulatory technologies grew 17% with Verafin at 25%. Verafin added 100 new clients this quarter, including our third Tier 1 bank. While we are excited about these additions, as we have previously discussed, the contracting and implementation with these larger and more complex institutions is longer. We will start recognizing subscription revenue in 2024, but we believe that regtech will only accelerate as we expand relationships with these clients. The strong performance of Verafin, along with 6% growth in Surveillance, led to the 17% growth of Regulatory Technology. For Surveillance, the fourth quarter growth was impacted by the timing of bookings in 2023 versus 2022. But fundamentals remain strong for the year, with 6 new clients in the fourth quarter and 27 for the full year. We also made inroads with the Tier 3 broker client cohort, which reflects progress beyond our leadership position with large banks. Cloud for Trade Surveillance is now above 50% deployment, which is an important driver of client stickiness through the speed and efficiency it enables us to provide. Moving on to Capital Markets Technology. We saw 3% growth, driven by data center connectivity demand. We had new Market Tech contract signings in Latin America and with one of our U.S. Tier 1 clients. We expect these contracts to start to accrue in 2024. As Adena mentioned, we continue to increase our market technology presence in Latin America and to have a leading role in the modernization of markets in the region. ARR for Fintech totaled $1.35 billion, an increase of 10% due to continued customer wins at Verafin as well as growth in trade management services and market technology. The division's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 40%, up 4 percentage points. The organic margin expansion reflects solid top line growth and expense control with an overall increase in revenue-related costs, offset by efficiencies and lower professional fees. We are progressing on our journey to improve the efficiencies in Market Technology while continuing to support the growth of Verafin and Surveillance. For the full year, the operating margin was 40%, up 5 percentage points, with a story which mirrors that of the quarter, including strong operating leverage and investments. Before closing on Fintech, a few additional words on Adenza. For November and December, Adenza contributed $149 million in revenue; $458 million of ARR, of which $98 million was in SaaS; and $35 million in non-GAAP operating expense. A strong finish to the year drove a 77% operating margin for our 2-month ownership. On a full year basis, Adenza had an adjusted EBITDA margin of 59%, ahead of our initial 58% outlook for the year. Let me now talk about Adenza's full year revenue and ARR. Revenue was $583 million in 2023, up 14%. ARR of $458 million grew 16%, excluding a significant bankruptcy that occurred during the year, were 14% net of it. Both metrics are on a constant currency basis. We had nearly 50% of new ACV coming from cloud this year. The strong cloud take-up by our clients supports our growth and efficiencies. Revenue growth benefited from a large portion of ARR up for renewal in the quarter and in the year. Going forward, we expect Adenza's revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens consistent with the medium- to long-term outlook we provided when we announced the acquisition. The timing of contracts being up for renewal and the mix of revenue between cloud and on-premise delivery will have an impact on revenue growth in any given quarter and year. This is why we are focused on ARR growth, which is not as impacted by in-year renewals and delivery method. We'll provide more details on the revenue dynamics of our Fintech division at Investor Day. And wrapping up our divisional overview with Market Services. Net revenue was $247 million for the quarter, roughly flat with growth in U.S. cash equities offset by decreases in U.S. options. U.S. cash equity's growth was driven by higher capture, partially offset by lower share. In a very competitive U.S. options environment, we are defending our strong market share lead and our attractive capture. Meanwhile, in Europe, tepid exchange volumes were positively offset by a $7 million nonrecurring payment and by the benefits of diversifications between fixed income and equities. The investments we have made in leveraging our technology and data to provide our European market clients with transparency helps them to generate alpha. This has enabled us to help our clients improve their execution quality and has been key to our ability to reclaim our 72% market share, a 2 percentage point increase. The division's operating margin was 57% in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to 60% in the prior year quarter as a result of higher compensation costs as we continue to invest in our people and higher technology costs due to ongoing investments related to both capacity and migrating U.S. markets to the cloud. The full year operating margin for the division totaled 59% with the same drivers as the quarterly story. Turning to Slide 19. This quarter's non-GAAP operating expense was $504 million, an organic increase of $8 million or 2% versus our organic revenue growth of 7%. [It went with the] story in the businesses, and it reflects good expense discipline as well as the timing of marketing and professional fees. Overall, this reflects a 52% operating margin, up 3 percentage points. For the full year, our non-GAAP operating expense was $1.83 billion, in line with guidance. We were up 5%, consistent with revenue growth for a flat operating margin at 52%. The increase is due to investments in key growth areas, inflation and higher revenue-related expense. We also achieved efficiencies during the year as we continue to optimize our location footprint and bring the divisions together as part of our divisional realignment. If you include Adenza for the full year, operating expense totaled $2.05 billion. Now on to guidance. We are initiating 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance of $2.105 billion to $2.185 billion, the midpoint of which reflects pro forma growth of 5%. This includes a full year of Adenza and the in-year expense method of net synergies. On an organic basis, excluding Adenza, Nasdaq's expense growth will be just under 4.5%. We will spend more time on synergies at Investor today, but we reiterate the net $80 million synergy target by the end of 2025 and $80 million cost to achieve as set forth in the restructuring program we just initiated. Additionally, we are guiding for full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis, slightly higher than 2023 due to lower expected tax benefit on equity awards. Turning to Slide 20. Strong free cash flow continues to be the hallmark of Nasdaq. For the year, we had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, and Adenza had $306 million in unlevered pretax free cash flow. Our gross leverage ratio was expected to be at 4.7 at the time of deal close, but we are pleased to share that at year-end, we are at 4.3 despite 0.1 headwind from euro strength. Let's go through the details on the chart. At the end of the third quarter, our adjusted leverage ratio was 2.4. We added the leverage to acquire Adenza. At the beginning of December, we paused share repurchases and repaid $260 million of term loans. The ratio benefited from the incremental EBITDA from Adenza's full year and Nasdaq's growth. We expect to continue deleveraging in the first quarter of 2024. And to wrap up on free cash flow utilization, we have repurchased $269 million of our common stock this year, including $110 million in the fourth quarter. And we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share for a 35% annualized payout ratio. In closing today, this quarter and this year's performance shows Nasdaq's ability to deliver consistent growth, margin and free cash flow in a range of environments. We are committed to disciplined execution and continued innovation. The investments we have made in our resilience, our technology and our data over the years, coupled with our reach and track record, position us for sustainable growth as we power our clients' success. Thank you for your time, and I will turn back to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And I show our first question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer.', 'Owen Lau', 'I know Sarah mentioned that you may talk about that during Investor Day, but could you please add more color on the initial progress of integrating Adenza and achieving revenue and cost synergies?', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Sure. Yes, so we -- as you said, we closed on November 1. We immediately created the operating model on a go-forward basis, meaning we combined the teams. We have a leadership structure now that is a combination of Adenza and Nasdaq personnel under Tal. And we've been working very hard to make sure that we bring the sales organizations together, the client delivery success, the operating teams as well as the technology teams together. And so, Owen, I think it's only a couple of months in, but we are definitely operating as 1 team. We have been -- we have a very specific and defined synergy plan. We have a very clear line of sight as to how we're going to achieve that plan. We will provide more details on that. But I would say, Owen, that across all of Nasdaq, we have a combination of efforts to make sure that we create efficiencies within the team, just as a normal acquisition integration would occur, but then also a locational strategy that allows us to align ourselves with our clients going forward and levers the strengths that Adenza has in some very critical centers of excellence around the world. So we do have, I think, a good plan. We will provide more details at Investor Day. And then the last thing I would say on revenue synergies, it's obviously very early days, and it takes time to sign new deals. It takes time to develop those relationships. But the early conversations that I've had and that Tal and Valerie, who's the Chief Revenue Officer, have been extremely encouraging. People really want to partner with us. They see us now as a partner to help them solve their largest problems. That's across reg tech, that's across anti-fincrime and risk management. I think they understand that we understand them. We are regulated. We have great relationships with regulators. And I think they also understand we can bring a lot of advanced technology in and advance the cloud capabilities within Adenza. So I have to tell you that the early conversations are really great. But as we've said all along, it will take time for those revenue synergies to actually show up in the financials. And again, we'll provide you more color on that at Investor Day."", 'Owen Lau', 'Got it. So on Verafin, you published a report, you talked about the amount of fraud and also potential opportunity. Can you talk about the strategy for you in 2024 for Verafin? Which area you think you can win more Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients? Is it more on the payment side or in other areas?', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes, sure. Yes, thanks for pointing that out, Owen. We did create a study that -- working with 2 outside parties. So it was both outside parties and us. We interviewed a lot of the key personnel within banks that are responsible for anti-fin crime to understand, number one, how big is the problem. $3 trillion of money laundered through the system, $0.5 trillion lost to fraud. And then how big is the problem in terms of actually having to solve it? And what are the challenges? One is that different criminal actors act differently. So you have to really have a different typologies of analytics to try to root out different criminal behaviors, number one. Number two, as we've always said, criminals, they don't just bank in one bank. So a single bank cannot look at all their transaction data and actually solve the problem. So Verafin is really a truly unique solution because we do have 2,500 banks that represent $6 trillion of assets all within a consortium data lake that allow us to find very defined typologies and really root out more criminal behavior. So we're seeing fewer false positives, more fraud found, more AML found, and we're able to prove that out. And that's why we've been able to sign up the Tier 1s and Tier 2s with another Tier 1 signed in the fourth quarter. Where we've been focusing, I would say a couple of things, Owen. One is on continuing to kind of have that flywheel on the SMBs. And in that particular case, we're really focused on moving into real-time payments and making sure that the small to medium banks have world-class AFC around their real-time payments. And that's a big growth area for us in '24. In the larger banks, we've been -- definitely the easiest ROI to show is fraud. So payment like wire fraud, ACH fraud, check fraud, all of the payments fraud we're finding is a huge benefit and very clear ROI. AML is a harder problem to solve, but we actually have signed one of the large Tier 2s, I think actually two of the large Tier 2s, is really focused on AML. And as we solve the fraud problem, what we're also finding is as soon as we go into these large banks, we show them our benefit on fraud, they're already starting to talk to us on AML. So that's the land and expand opportunity that we have, and we definitely see expansion opportunities in '24 with the banks you've already signed. And then the last thing I would say is that we also are really focused now in the U.K. And in fact, Brendan is meeting with banks this week to really understand and look at our -- particularly our payments fraud capabilities in the U.K. The laws are changing to allow for more data sharing, and that will make it so that our pooling is much more effective in supporting their problem and making it so that we can provide a solution there. So that's our next leg of growth as we go through '24 into '25."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan.', 'Michael Cho', ""My question, I just wanted to touch on Adenza here. We've talked about ARR growth, it's been solid in the mid-teens, and you've clearly discussed your medium-term ambitions there. But just given the kind of somewhat lengthy sales cycle there, I mean, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about any expectations for Adenza revenue growth this year maybe in the context of your long-term targets. And then also any color you can provide between Axiom and Calypso would be helpful."", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Sure. Yes. I would just say, on an ARR growth perspective, we did provide you kind of that mid-teens view of ARR growth, and we continue to see the business dynamics supporting that. And so we would expect that, that medium-term outlook for Adenza will continue to support that mid-teens growth. I think that, as we know, revenue growth is impacted by timing of bookings, timing of renewals there and whether or not it's on-prem or cloud. So we're going to actually unpack that at Investor Day to help you understand how do you turn ARR into revenue, how do revenue dynamics change. And recognizing there would be more quarterly shift in revenues, but the general view is that ARR growth is definitely the fundamental thing to look at in terms of how you evaluate the work in progress of Adenza or Calypso and Axiom. And at the same time, we do want you to understand how the revenue dynamics work. The more we sign cloud, the more the contracts become ratable over the life of the contract. And whereas in on-prem deals, we recognize half the license fees upfront upon signing. So there's a lot to unpack there. But we feel great about the overall demand drivers. The other thing to think about with Axiom and Calypso is that timing of renewals also can have an impact in revenue recognition. But again, we're seeing really strong demand cycles for both Axiom and Calypso, so we feel very good about that, whereas timing of revenue might be a little different from one to another just based on when the renewal cycles hit in a given year. So that's definitely, again, we'll go through. But I would say the foundation is very strong and remains consistent with what we expected."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies.', 'Daniel Thomas Fannon', 'Was hoping to expand upon that a little bit and maybe incorporate pricing in terms of what pricing contributed to revenue growth and/or ARR growth in 2023 and how you think about that for the Adenza business prospectively.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes. So actually, I mean, we're not going to get very specific on that particular year. But as a general dynamic, when we look at ARR growth, we basically attribute about half the ARR growth to upsells, actually. And we upsold a lot of clients, and I think can give you that number. But we upsold almost 150 clients, I think 120 clients in 2023. And then the other half comes from a combination of pricing increases and new bookings. We don't break that out in terms of that pass. But I would just say it is a combination of both. And the way that it works is, obviously, we add a lot of value across the products as we go through the year. And so as we go into both annualized increases that are contractually stated, but also renewal cycles, we definitely show that the value of what we're providing to them corresponds with an increase; and/or their assets are increasing and therefore, they're using this across a larger part of their business, and that also warrants an increase. But those are -- that dynamic is consistent."", 'Daniel Thomas Fannon', 'Understood. And then just as a follow-up. Based on, I think, some of the factors that were mentioned for listings revenue in the fourth quarter, as you think about the first half of this year and/or the full year, with the roll-off of initial fees from prior years plus a hopeful recovery in new listings, how should we think about the revenue dynamics here in 2024?', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes, sure. Well, just -- by the way, just to be very precise, we had 142 upsells, including 3 cross-sells in Adenza in 2023. I just want to make sure we get the facts out there. But in terms of the listings dynamics, it definitely has been a more challenging environment in listings. And as you know, as you point out, the amortization of the initial listing piece is an important dynamic within the listings revenues. It benefits -- it means when we have a really strong year of listings, like we had in 2020 and 2021, we don't recognize all the initial listing fees that year. It kind of gives us a lift in the following years because those fees are amortized over 2 to 4 years, depending on the size of listing. But then it means that when we have two more challenging years, it takes time for that to also filter through. And so we will have kind of residual impact of these lower years in 2024 and 2025 as the initial listing fees from the higher years roll off and we don't have -- we have, as you've noticed, kind of a net reduction in listings in 2023. So we would expect that 2024 will be a challenging year for listings. Within the Data and Listings business, though, we basically are saying that it's a low to mid-single-digit grower. And we would anticipate that we can still achieve that even with the more muted listing revenue that we would expect in 2024."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW.', 'Kyle Kenneth Voigt', 'I mean, maybe first question on sales cycles. You noted that you saw early signs of normalization of sales cycles for your IR and asset owner solutions. Can you just speak a bit more about those early signs and give some examples? And in terms of what that means for revenue growth, should we think about the Workflow and Insights organic growth potentially being near floor-type level at 5% organic in the fourth quarter and gradually improving from here? Or any other commentary you could provide in terms of the timing and what that improvement means around the sales cycles.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Sure. So all of the solutions within Workflow and Insights are SaaS solutions. So how you end the year really determines a lot about the following year. And so we definitely saw a more challenging environment with corporates last year. The listing environment was more muted, but also they were just not as focused on investing across IR in a more challenging market backdrop. That improved in the fourth quarter, and so we did start to have a more -- I would say a more normalized environment for conversations and signings of corporate clients for our IR solutions in the fourth quarter, but it was against the backdrop of a harder year overall. So it will take time for that improved environment to actually flow through and show up in the actual SaaS revenues because we obviously have to continue to see that, and it will kind of build on itself. But I would expect that 2024 will continue to kind of have some overhang from the weaker environment '23 even with a more normalized sales environment. With Analytics, it's actually what's interesting. Our overall Analytics growth was quite strong in the fourth quarter at 9%. And I think that, that really reflects demand for our data across the buy side and the analytics solutions we have that serve the buy side. But our asset owner solutions, this is a very specific software capability that we offer to endowments and pensions and others, that actually did have an uptick in demand and signing in the fourth quarter, but it was an overall difficult year. So that, again, I think will create a headwind as we go through 2024 with the hope that we can start to show some pickup as we go through the year."", 'Kyle Kenneth Voigt', ""Understood. And maybe a follow-up on Adenza. You mentioned the strong cloud uptake. I guess I'm not trying to front-run the Investor Day, but can you just remind us what the cloud adoption will mean with respect to EBITDA margins over the long term, at least directionally? And given the length of these contracts and given the level of uptake in cloud that you're seeing on renewals, is there a rough timeframe as to how quickly that cloud migration might happen over the next few years?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""That's -- I would say we will provide at least more color on that at Investor Day. But if we think about it, I think, Sarah, it's like 14% of overall revenue?"", 'Sarah M. Youngwood', '14% of revenue is currently cloud and 50% of new ACV bookings.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""And then in ARR, it's 21%?"", 'Sarah M. Youngwood', '21%.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes, 21% of ARR is cloud. So we have a lot of runway here. So as we renew clients, moving them into the cloud modules, as we sign new clients, signing them for new modules, but recognizing that we can sign a client just on a new module in cloud. Like it doesn't have to be that they're signing for Calypso and they're adding new functionality. Just that new functionality, we can deliver at cloud. That's how flexible the platform is. They don't have to kind of redo the whole platform implementation on cloud. But that also means that as we work with clients on renewals and changes, they're going to have different timelines for how they want to bring that cloud capabilities in. Some banks are marching very fast into cloud, and they have like actually top-down mandates to move to cloud. And that can obviously be a huge catalyst for us. But other banks are marching quite slowly towards it. So we want to be flexible. We expect this to be, as we said, very much a multiyear transition going from 21% of ARR and growing and growing. But I have to say it will be a slow-moving train. In terms of the economics, it is both an opportunity for us to be a true managed service provider, which gives us more revenue opportunity and also provide it with a very nice margin for both them and us. So that's an opportunity for uplift, but again, a slow-moving train. So we'll want to make sure that we give you a little more color on that at Investor Day."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Citi.', 'Christopher John Allen', 'I was wondering if you could help us think about the contract value from client wins at Adenza. Maybe any color just in terms of how much a new client, that you had 6 for this quarter, would translate from a new contract perspective. And when you expand relationships with existing clients, are we talking about a 10% increase, 15% increase? Any color there would be helpful.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Well, we don't actually provide specific contract values per client or anything like that. If you don't mind, I think we'll take that one back and think about how we want to provide more transparency there. But I would say this, it's always land and expand. And actually, as we move up into Tier 2s and Tier 1s in AFC, it's land and expand. So we might sign a client for, let's say, mid- to high 6 figures or low 7 figures to land. And then as we expand, we can go and we can double or triple or even in some cases have 5x amount over time. And I do think we have some examples of that back when we first signed the deal and on our third quarter results, we gave some examples of how we've expanded contracts over time. But we're not providing specifics on like what the new contract values were for the new clients right now."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler.', 'Patrick Malcolm Moley', 'I just had one on the retention ratios for Adenza. It looked like for the full year, they -- both the gross and net basis, came in a little bit lower than what you were expecting when you initially announced the deal even after you include the impact of that -- those bankruptcies. So I just was hoping maybe you could provide some more color on what you think led to that underperformance there. And then any color on the retention ratios or what your targeted retention ratios would be going forward.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes. So I think we did see some declines in the gross and net retention in the latter part of the year. And I think it really -- a lot of that did come from the bankruptcy that we mentioned. And that really did -- started impacting us in the fourth quarter. And then we had -- I would just say the, what I would call, the events of 2023 across the banking system did create some levels of challenge in a couple of very specific areas of retention. But it's not -- I would say there was nothing systemic about the concern. There was nothing that we saw that was more a trend in any way whatsoever. It was more the encapsulation of a lot of the events that occurred during the year, both in terms of looking at the retention as well as kind of some of the acquisitions that occurred. But again, these are very, very specific and nothing trend-wise. But I don't know, Sarah, if you want to add anything to that?"", 'Sarah M. Youngwood', ""Yes. The retention on a gross basis was actually flat at 97% if you exclude that bankruptcy. So when we look at it in terms of like long-term trend, we feel that it's very solid."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.', 'Michael J. Cyprys', ""I just wanted to ask on capital allocation, how you're thinking about allocating capital now that the Adenza deal has closed. How you're thinking about the pace of debt paydown as well as buybacks. I thought I heard you mention that you paused on buybacks. Is that pause still in place? And what would lead you to reinstate buybacks?"", 'Sarah M. Youngwood', ""Mike, nice to continue. This is Sarah. So what we have is the strategy that we have outlined is maintained. So we have a balanced view of how to deal with the capital allocation, just to reiterate, across the dividend, the share repurchase and the deleveraging. You've seen the pause, as I mentioned, and that pause is going to be maintained in the first quarter. It's very important for us to continue to deleverage and -- but that is a short-term tactical as part of a strategy that overall hasn't changed. So we continue to be committed to the progressive dividend, and you've seen the progress there. As well as over time, it's important to continue to offset dilution with share repurchase. So that's the context. And of course, this is also a topic that we'll come back to at Investor Day."", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""One thing we're pleased with, Michael, is that, yes, just leaving 2023, as Sarah mentioned, we're at 4.3x leverage. So that's ahead of what we had anticipated at the closing of the deal. And so that's actually kind of both the strength of the business as well as some very specific tactical decisions we made to pay down the term loan as we're kind of getting started to kind of launch into 2024 with a very solid plan on deleveraging. But also the focus though will be on that balanced approach over time."", 'Michael J. Cyprys', ""Great. And just a follow-up on the expense outlook. Just on the expense outlook, I was just hoping you could elaborate on the 5% pro forma growth in expenses for this year in '24, what would drive you towards the higher end versus the lower end of the range and any moving pieces you might be able to elaborate on?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Sure. Yes. So I would say that, first of all, we've been really focused on making sure that we are being as efficient as possible across the business just on a run rate basis; that we are also, though, making -- continuing to make the investments in driving our products forward, our growth over, but also automation, bringing more automation into the company; and at the same time beginning the synergy achievement on the Adenza deal. And the midpoint really reflects all of that. What would drive the expenses above that would be higher growth. So if we're able to grow faster and we're able to grow more, there might be some revenue-related expenses that come in, in terms of just being able to achieve that revenue. But I think that it has also more to do with can we continue to actually accelerate some of our investments if we're seeing higher revenue growth throughout the year. And that's why we always give you a range of kind of the mid- to long-term outlook on our solutions business growth, revenue growth and expense growth so that you can kind of understand how we calibrate it. But we do feel like it's been a good combination at the midpoint of expense discipline, Adenza's synergies, but also targeted investments in our business."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic.And I show our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bond from Rosenblatt Securities.', 'Andrew Bond', ""Could you update us on any new plans or strategies Nasdaq is exploring in digital assets since you aborted the custody offering, obvious tailwinds following the spot ETF approvals and a lot of new large institutional players that you're familiar with becoming more active in the space. So how is Nasdaq just seeing itself now?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Sure. Thanks, Andrew. Yes. So we are really proud to partner with BlackRock and Valkyrie as they brought their Bitcoin ETFs to Nasdaq, and it really does give investors an opportunity to express a view on the trend of Bitcoin without -- in a highly regulated marketplace and without having to go and actually buy Bitcoin. So we do think it creates more accessibility for retail investors to have a position in Bitcoin. I think that in terms of the broader digital asset space though, as you know, we are a tech provider to the industry. We continue to provide technology to cryptocurrency exchanges, both trading, clearing and as well as surveillance. And actually, as we've been working with some traditional exchanges, they want to make sure that they're kind of future-proofed. So for instance, with one of the CSD clients that we sold to this year, one of the key things was to make sure that they could move towards digital assets in their settlement system. And so we are -- all of our technology can support digital assets in terms of trading, clearing, settlement, surveillance, and that gives us a chance to work with the traditional exchanges and crypto changes. In terms of our specific crypto custody solution, we have built it. We are ready to provide that to exchanges and providers and custodians around the world. So that is now a technology offering that we can offer to clients around the world. But we have made a conscious choice not to launch a custody solution, being a custodian ourselves. I think that we feel that there are several out there, that they're operating well, but it's also very capital-intensive business. And our view is that we are better served being a market operator for ETFs and other instruments like that, as well as being a technology provider to the industry."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs.', 'Alexander Blostein', ""So just a quick follow-up again on Adenza. Over the last couple of years, it sounded like they went through a pretty meaningful improvement in their technology stack, and there's probably a bit of CapEx around it. So as you move forward, do you think they're largely done? Are there still kind of things that might be on the heavier lifting side that needs to get implemented, that they're not part of Nasdaq? And maybe just talk to your overall CapEx expectations for 2024."", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Sure. So I would say that -- we'll take Calypso and AxiomSL separately. AxiomSL did do a significant rewrite of their technology a few years ago. So we feel very good about kind of how they're positioned. But -- and then Calypso, actually the one -- they are super flexible and very modular. So they kind of have this continuum investment in Calypso. And they've been able to -- because of that, they've actually been much more able to -- or both of them are focused on just bringing in new modules very quickly and iterating on their technology. So we feel really good about the tech foundation, and I think we said that at the time of signing. Now that we've closed on the deal and we've looked under the hood, it is a great technology, and it's very modular and kind of platform-based. I think the area that we can really help focus them is on how do we really optimize the cloud implementation to make it so that it's as efficient as possible for them and their clients. And so we have a lot of expertise there. We have a long history of cloud-deployed solutions. And so we do actually think that's an area where we can help them invest to make it so that, that can be even more effectively and efficiently delivered. But that's not a significant capital investment as much as us just continuing innovation. They have been investing in R&D. So that has been a hallmark of their business, and so we're really pleased to see that. And we will continue that, but that's not something where there's a big CapEx requirement right now. We really do see it as a continuum of innovation. In terms of our CapEx across the year, I think -- I don't know if you have any specific things that you might mention there."", 'Sarah M. Youngwood', ""No, we don't have like any like particular trend. So you're not going to see like a particular like acceleration or something of note. We're continuing to invest in the business, and we'll come back and give you a lot of like color at Investor Day on the type of returns and the type of breakdowns of our investments. And we have very much a cash-on-cash view as to what it gives us, and in addition to, of course, the investments that are foundational in the business."", 'Operator', 'And I show our last question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.', 'Brian Bertram Bedell', 'Most have been asked, but a couple more. One, just on the Verafin. I think, Sarah, you mentioned, if I heard correctly, Verafin growth in the quarter year-over-year of 25% against the legacy Regulatory Tech segment of 17%. And then I did -- I missed something you said about the Surveillance part of that. So I just wanted to clarify with that 25% at Verafin and there was some offset at the Surveillance business. And then as you look at that legacy business going forward, do you still -- do you see Verafin as sort of a core 20%-ish type of grower?', 'Sarah M. Youngwood', ""So what I said is that the 25% indeed is the growth for Verafin. And together with Surveillance, you end up at 17%. So that's a 6% for Surveillance. That is due to a timing of bookings in 2022 that has been an impact on the year-on-year growth for the fourth quarter. So it's really just timing in the prior year period."", 'Adena T. Friedman', 'For Surveillance.', 'Sarah M. Youngwood', 'For Surveillance.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""I think, Brian, yes, as you know, Brian, we have a kind of an 18% to 23% kind of expectation across FT. Now as we move to reg tech, and we integrated that with AxiomSL, we're going to be providing kind of a view. And I think it's -- I always looked at it as 10% to 14% across Fintech, all told. And that will incorporate Verafin and Surveillance along with Market Tech and the Adenza products."", 'Brian Bertram Bedell', ""Right. Great. Great. And then just 1 last 1 on operating leverage, given your expense guidance. Just, I guess, the level of confidence on the operating leverage. Really, it looks like it's a good 3 percentage points or more below your 8% to 11% Solutions revenue guide. But how do you think of the Adenza revenue dynamics versus ARR at Adenza influencing that? I guess the punchline question here is, are you still managing that operating leverage against reported revenue? Or would you look at that ARR as a better guide for that operating leverage dynamic?"", 'Sarah M. Youngwood', 'So we continue to focus on our operating margin and to focus on having operating leverage as we invest on a GAAP basis. But we will always give you the details on the ARR basis, which is really the better economic view of what we are doing.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO, for closing remarks.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Great. Thank you. And as we enter another exciting year at Nasdaq, we remain focused on activating and unlocking new opportunities that will drive the business into the future. Before I close, I want to remind everyone, if you didn't remember already, that we have our scheduled 2024 Investor Day on Tuesday, March 5. And we hope to see you all there either in person or virtually, and we look forward to sharing our vision with you. Thank you for joining us, and have a great day."", 'Operator', ""Thank you.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer staples sector, its performance, and outlook for 2024, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'In 2023, consumer staples companies experienced a decline in popularity as their revenue growth slowed down. Investors redirected their attention away from these companies and shifted towards mega-cap tech firms, which garnered greater interest and investment. The change in preference may be attributed to the perceived higher growth potential and innovation associated with the tech sector compared to the more stable but slower-growing consumer staples industry. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index found itself as the second weakest sector within the large-cap benchmark index. This particular index monitors companies within the S&P 500 classified under the GICS consumer staples sector. Throughout 2023, it experienced a decline of 2.4%, marking it as the second-worst performer, with only the utility sector exhibiting poorer results. Despite this setback, there is a more optimistic outlook for the consumer staples sector, suggesting that its future performance may not be as gloomy as indicated by its recent downturn.', 'Consumer staples companies specialize in producing or selling essential goods, such as toilet paper, bread, and toothpaste—items that people continue to purchase consistently, even in challenging economic circumstances or job loss. This consistent demand for essential products offers advantages for both consumer staples stocks and their investors. These benefits include reliable and predictable revenues, as well as resilience during economic downturns. When coupled with operational excellence, the top consumer staples stocks demonstrate a steady and gradual growth in earnings and cash flow over an extended period. Analysts are expressing optimism for the sector in 2024 due to these capabilities. Filippo Falorni, Vice President and Equity Research Analyst at Citi, shared with BNN Bloomberg his anticipation that consumer staple stocks, often regarded by investors as substitutes for bonds, will yield favorable returns throughout the current year. This expectation is rooted in the belief that these stocks will perform well amid a slowing U.S. economy. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“The consumer has been more resilient than expected … and as a result, sectors that are more offensive have performed better than staples, which tend to perform better when you have more concerns around the (macroeconomics). We’re starting to see a little bit of a slowdown in consumer spending … so I think staples, in general, can become more of a preferred sector as we head into particularly the second half of 2024.”', 'The onset of the pandemic has created new opportunities for the consumer staples sector, particularly with the surge in online shopping. The shift in consumer behavior towards digital platforms has become a notable avenue for growth within the sector. According to a recent report by Bloomberg Intelligence, digital commerce is projected to expand its share of total US retail sales significantly. Starting at 25% in 2022, the report forecasts that digital commerce will account for a third of all retail sales by the year 2027. This anticipated growth underscores the increasing prevalence and influence of online transactions in the retail landscape, highlighting a notable shift in consumer shopping habits over the coming years.', 'The digitalization of the consumer staples sector contributes to its defensive characteristics. While traditionally viewed as defensive due to the consistent demand for essential products, the integration of digital technologies adds an extra layer of resilience. The sector may not generate exceptionally high returns, but it also exhibits stability and is less prone to abrupt failures. Moreover, many of these stocks provide dividends, which can be viewed as a tangible return on investment even before substantial growth occurs. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent consumer staples stocks that pay regular dividends to shareholders. Given this, we will discuss the best consumer staples dividend stocks in this article.', 'A retail employee stocking shelves with consumer packaged goods/manufacturing products.', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we identified dividend-paying stocks from the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index with strong dividend growth track records.

The company provides products and related services from thousands of suppliers to over 725,000 customer locations including restaurants (~62% of sales), education and government facilities (~8%), travel and leisure establishments (~8%), healthcare facilities (~7%), and other foodservice customers (15%). Sysco possesses many business characteristics that FMI finds attractive. The company has a dominant market position in a large, growing, resilient industry. They sell necessary, consumable products. Economies of scale allow Sysco to provide a better offering than peers while also allowing them to operate with higher margins. These advantages have helped Sysco take market share over time and earn a return on capital that consistently exceeds its cost of capital. We believe that Sysco will continue to grow its market share in the large and fragmented foodservice distribution market and should be able to generate mid-single-digit EBIT growth over time. When combined with share repurchases and dividend yield, the company should generate a high-single-digit to low-double-digit total return to investors without multiple expansion.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Devon Energy's  ROE."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Devon Energy ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Devon Energy is:', '32% = US$3.8b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.32."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""First thing first, we like that Devon Energy has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 23% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Devon Energy's exceptional 54% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise."", ""As a next step, we compared Devon Energy's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 33%."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Devon Energy fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide."", ""The high three-year median payout ratio of 50% (implying that it keeps only 50% of profits) for Devon Energy suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders."", ""Additionally, Devon Energy has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 34% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Devon Energy is predicted to decline to 24% despite the anticipated decrease in the payout ratio. We reckon that there could probably be other factors that could be driving the forseen decline in the company's ROE."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Devon Energy's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.1%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $2.12 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.65% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yum would post earnings of $1.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.44, delivering a surprise of +14.29%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Numerous American companies have adhered to this principle, contributing to a notable increase in dividend distributions over the years. S&P Dow Jones Indices data revealed that the dividend payments of S&P 500 companies totaled $420 billion in 2017, surging to $565 billion in 2022. The trend continued in 2023, setting a new record with dividend payments reaching an impressive $588.2 billion. The most recent report from S&P Dow Jones pointed out that there were 707 instances of dividend increases in the fourth quarter of 2023. The cumulative amount of these increases reached $17.5 billion for the quarter, marking an increase from the $16.3 billion reported in the same period of 2022.', 'Companies displaying consistent growth in dividends have attracted the interest of investors, prompting companies to undertake the challenging task of sustaining and expanding their dividends, even during market downturns. This strategic approach has proven to be beneficial for these companies, as those experiencing dividend growth have yielded substantial returns over the years. According to a Cohen & Steers report, during the decade leading up to 2010, dividend-paying companies outpaced non-payers by 620 basis points annually, with significantly lower risk measured by standard deviation. Over a 30-year period ending in 2011, the advantage of dividend-paying companies becomes even more pronounced. Notably, across each time frame during this period, the subset of dividend payers that increased or initiated dividends in the preceding 12 months exhibited higher returns and lower volatility compared to both payers and non-payers.', 'Aside from delivering robust returns, consistent dividend stocks have been playing a significant role in generating personal income. As per findings from S&P Dow Jones Indices, dividends have progressively become a more substantial source of income over the past four decades.

That beat the average estimate of $3.08 peer share from Zacks Investment Research.', '""We delivered strong earnings and revenue growth for the full year 2023, driven by healthy consumer spending, cross-border volume growth of 24%, and the solid execution of our strategy,"" Miebach said.', ""But the pace of payments growth is slowing in the U.S. Switched volume, which refers to authorization, clearing and settlement, grew 11% during the fourth quarter. That's down from 14% in the third quarter and higher than 10% during January 2024."", ""Similar to Visa, which attributed slower January sales partly to the weather in the U.S., Mastercard said the slower January numbers stemmed from a series of severe winter storms. Payment performance outside during periods of calmer weather were in line with December's performance. An analyst note from Jeffries also said the January dip for Mastercard was likely due to inclement weather."", 'Visa last week reported a decline of about 80 basis in U.S. payment volume growth, as well as a decline in payments in January, an exception to what were overall strong earnings. Visa attributed the declines to inherently temporary factors such as a less favorable mix of weekends and weekdays for shopping, in addition to the poor weather in January. American Express reported strong earnings, but noted flat payment volume from small businesses and an increase in loss provisions. Amex said macroeconomic stress has not substantially impacted its business, and affirmed its growth outlook for 2024.', ""Discover's earnings saw a charge-off rate of 4.1% at the end of the fourth quarter, up from 2.1% over 2022 and 59 basis points from the prior quarter. Discover also raised its loan-loss provision from $900 million to $1.9 billion."", 'While U.S. electronic payments growth continues to outpace GDP and population growth, domestic electronic-payments growth will gradually slow, even with a range of new use cases being developed, according to Eric Grover, a principal at Intrepid Ventures. ""Global electronic payments growth should remain robust for decades to come, barring major war or economic calamity,"" Grover said.', 'Mastercard also said tougher comparisons weighed on payment growth statistics. The spikes in payment growth were higher late in 2022 and early 2023, making it harder for current growth rates to match the recent past. Mastercard is still pursuing ""secular"" opportunities in the U.S., including expanding open-loop transit payments, open banking and real-time payment processing, according to Miebach. ""There are also geopolitical concerns in several markets,"" Miebach said of factors that could impact payment growth in the year ahead.', 'Mastercard is monitoring the potential impact of the dozens of 2024 elections that may be contested or otherwise volatile, both in the U.S. and globally. Analysts asked Miebach about the impact of isolationism, or leaders that are less prone to support international business. Mastercard, for example, reported 18% growth in cross-border payment volume during the quarter.', 'Miebach did not directly address the impact of isolationism on international payments, but noted that the card network is monitoring elections and is doing scenario planning based on different results or unexpected news surrounding elections.', '""Elections are no different from monitoring fiscal moves by central banks,"" Miebach said, adding that Mastercard is performing scenario planning and will form a response strategy in the event an election causes an unforeseen interruption in payments or an economic impact.', '""The past three years have had no shortage of such challenges and we responded quickly,"" Miebach said.', ""Mastercard additionally plans to support payments in China in the near future, Miebach said. Mastercard has been trying to establish a domestic payment market in China for years, but has faced quickly changing regulations from the Chinese government. China appears to be more open than in the past; China's regulators have approved Mastercard's local joint venture to process payments."", '""We\'re thrilled about China. It\'s a massive opportunity,"" Miebach said, adding that use cases will include payments for Chinese consumers both inside China and when traveling.', 'For the full 2023 year, Mastercard reported net revenue of $25.1 billion, up 13% from about $22.2 billion the prior year. Mastercard projected growth in the low double digits for the first quarter. For the full year of 2024, Mastercard projected growth at the high end of low double digit rate.', '""The full-year outlook … is in line with Wall Street projections, implying 17% earnings per share growth,"" Jeffries analysts said.']"

Interestingly, this incremental bullishness from Wall Street comes even as the company's top-line growth decelerates."", 'So, what is there to love about the report? RBC Capital analyst Jon Arfstrom, who increased his 12-month price target on shares from $220 to $226 after the report, breaks down the bull case: It boils down to better-than-expected expense management, a steady normalization of delinquency rates, and good momentum across several key business metrics.', ""Let's explore these ideas further to see if Arfstrom is onto something."", ""There's no way around it: American Express' growth is slowing. The company's Q4 year-over-year revenue-growth rate slowed to 11%, down from 13% in Q3 and 17% in the first half of 2023. Looking to 2024, management guided for 9% to 11% top-line growth -- down from 14% growth for the full year of 2023. But here's what has Arfstrom and some other analysts upbeat even in the face of slowing growth: American Express management is still guiding for earnings-per-share (EPS) growth in 2024 to increase at a rate in the mid-teens. This expectation for strong-earnings momentum is primarily due to a combination of disciplined spending, operating leverage, and a flexible spending model."", 'Highlighting its operating leverage, management said it expected operating expenses to be flat compared to last year, with total expenses growing at a rate in the mid-to-high single digits (this is slower than its guidance for 9% to 11% revenue growth). Management often cites its ability to remain agile with spending and adjust it for various markets as a strength of its business.', '""We will, of course, continue to assess opportunities as we move through the year, and our flexible model will allow us to dial up or down investments as needed,"" said American Express Chief Financial Officer Christophe Le Caillec during the company\'s earnings call.', ""Arfstrom also applauds American Express' modestly rising delinquency rates as its customers' credit profiles normalize manageably. The integrated-payments specialist's delinquency rates of 2% still remain below pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, this rate increased sequentially in Q4 but at a slower rate than peers."", 'A slow and steady normalization gives management visibility into its business and can help the company adjust marketing expenses and its credit-underwriting models as needed.', 'Another reason to bet on the stock is its multifaceted growth model, including soaring interest income and robust card-fee revenue growth. This takes some of the pressure off of the company to constantly grow card spending on its platform.', ""American Express' interest income, for instance, rose 31% year over year in Q4. While some of this has been driven by net-yield expansion versus last year due to a higher interest rate environment, growth in revolving loan balances has also helped."", ""Additionally, the company's fee-based membership model also continues to generate nice growth in card-fee revenue. Net card-fee revenue rose 14% year over year in Q4. Year-over-year increases to some of the fees it charges cardholders helped, but the primary driver for this segment is actually growth in the number of cardholders with fee-based premium cards."", ""Though management expects both of these tailwinds to moderate some in 2024, their strength today is a testament to the company's multifaceted growth model. Management can pick and choose from areas to invest in while it manages its expenses in a disciplined and agile manner."", ""Overall, it's easy to see why Arfstrom remains bullish on the stock even as top-line growth is slowing. Trading at just 18 times earnings and boasting a dividend yield of 1.2%, American Express stock continues to look attractive even after the stock's 40% gain over the past three months."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?', 'Before you buy stock in American Express, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and American Express wasn't one of them.

The comparable prior-year periods in fiscal 2022 included 14 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively.', 'Fourth Quarter Sales Performance Was in Line with the Company’s Expectations with a Comparable Store Sales Decline of 4.2%', 'Fiscal Year 2023 Net Sales Increased 2.5%; Fiscal Year Comparable Store Sales Were Even with the Prior Year', 'Fourth Quarter Diluted Earnings per Share (""EPS"") of $2.28 and Fiscal Year 2023 Diluted EPS of $10.09', 'Returned More Than $1.0 Billion of Capital to Shareholders in Fiscal Year 2023', 'Company Provides Fiscal Year 2024 Diluted EPS Outlook of $9.85 to $10.50', '""As we recently marked Tractor Supply’s milestone 85th anniversary, my thanks and appreciation go out to our more than 50,000 Team Members for their dedication to Life Out Here and for living our Mission and Values. While our financial performance in 2023 did not meet our initial expectations, our team successfully navigated a highly dynamic environment with agility, operational resiliency and a focus on our strategic investments. As we exit 2023, our business has never been stronger. Our healthy customer engagement, all time high customer satisfaction scores, peak productivity of our supply chain, technology enhancements and the scaled transformation of our store base all serve as proof points of the strength of our business,"" said Hal Lawton, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tractor Supply.', '""In 2024, we will continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and to capture the significant growth opportunities in our market. We believe that our business can continue to perform well in the coming years given the investments we have made in our Life Out Here strategy. We remain excited about our bright future and are committed to delivering sustained long-term value creation for our shareholders,"" said Lawton.', 'Fourth Quarter 2023 ResultsNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 8.6% to $3.66 billion from $4.01 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. The prior year’s fourth quarter included an extra sales week as part of the Company’s 53-week calendar in 2022, which negatively impacted the period over period sales performance by approximately 5.6 percentage points. The decrease in net sales was also attributable to a decline in comparable store sales, partially offset by positive sales contributions from new stores. Comparable store sales decreased 4.2%, as compared to an increase of 8.6% in the prior year’s fourth quarter, driven by a comparable average ticket decline of 1.5% and a comparable average transaction count decline of 2.7%. Comparable store sales performance reflects continued strength in year-round consumable, usable and edible (""C.U.E."") categories, offset by softness in cold weather products, discretionary categories and, to a lesser extent, big ticket items. In the fourth quarter of 2022, comparable store sales benefited by approximately 200 basis points from a late December winter storm.', 'Gross profit decreased 5.2% to $1.29 billion from $1.36 billion in the prior year’s fourth quarter, while gross margin increased 129 basis points to 35.3% from 34.0% in the prior year’s fourth quarter. The gross margin rate increase was attributable to ongoing lower transportation costs and disciplined product cost management, modestly offset by negative product mix. Gross margin continued to benefit from the Company’s ongoing execution of an everyday low price strategy, complemented by the use of its Neighbor’s Club loyalty program.', 'Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses, including depreciation and amortization, decreased 4.5% to $958.8 million from $1.00 billion in the prior year’s fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 113 basis points to 26.2% from 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the Company’s planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of a new distribution center, as well as higher medical claims and fixed cost deleverage. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation and the completion of a previously announced sale-leaseback of five Tractor Supply store locations. The sale-leaseback benefited SG&A by approximately 40 basis points.', 'Operating income decreased 7.0% to $334.2 million from $359.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'The effective income tax rate was 23.1% compared to 22.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'Net income decreased 8.5% to $247.9 million from $270.9 million. Diluted EPS decreased 6.2% to $2.28 compared to $2.43 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The benefit of the 53rd week contributed approximately $0.16 to diluted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'The Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its common stock for $110.4 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $111.4 million, returning $221.8 million of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'The Company opened 19 new Tractor Supply stores and three new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores, and closed one Tractor Supply store in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'Fiscal Year 2023 ResultsNet sales for fiscal 2023 increased 2.5% to $14.56 billion from $14.20 billion in fiscal 2022. Comparable store sales were even with the prior year versus a 6.3% increase in fiscal 2022.', 'Gross profit increased 5.1% to $5.23 billion from $4.97 billion in fiscal 2022, and gross margin increased 92 basis points to 35.9% from 35.0% in fiscal 2022.', 'SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization and asset impairment, increased 6.0% to $3.75 billion from $3.54 billion in fiscal 2022. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 86 basis points to 25.8% from 24.9% in fiscal 2022.', 'Operating income increased 3.1% to $1.48 billion compared to $1.43 billion in fiscal 2022.', 'The effective income tax rate was 22.7% compared to 22.5% in fiscal 2022.', 'Net income increased 1.7% to $1.11 billion from $1.09 billion, and diluted EPS increased 3.9% to $10.09 from $9.71 in fiscal 2022. The benefit of the 53rd week contributed approximately $0.16 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2022.', 'In fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares of its common stock for $597.0 million. The Company also paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $449.6 million during fiscal 2023, returning $1.05 billion of capital to shareholders.', 'During fiscal 2023, the Company opened 70 new Tractor Supply stores and 13 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores, and closed one Tractor Supply store and one Petsense by Tractor Supply store.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) were released last week, making it a good time to revisit its performance. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$36b and statutory earnings per share of US$3.62. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for Mondelez International ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Mondelez International from 17 analysts is for revenues of US$37.3b in 2024. If met, it would imply a credible 3.5% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to shrink 3.2% to US$3.53 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$37.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.57 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", 'There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$82.22, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Mondelez International at US$88.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$73.00. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.', ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Mondelez International's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 3.5% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 7.1% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 2.4% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Mondelez International's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$82.22, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer staples sector, its performance, and outlook for 2024, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'In 2023, consumer staples companies experienced a decline in popularity as their revenue growth slowed down. Investors redirected their attention away from these companies and shifted towards mega-cap tech firms, which garnered greater interest and investment. The change in preference may be attributed to the perceived higher growth potential and innovation associated with the tech sector compared to the more stable but slower-growing consumer staples industry. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index found itself as the second weakest sector within the large-cap benchmark index. This particular index monitors companies within the S&P 500 classified under the GICS consumer staples sector. Throughout 2023, it experienced a decline of 2.4%, marking it as the second-worst performer, with only the utility sector exhibiting poorer results. Despite this setback, there is a more optimistic outlook for the consumer staples sector, suggesting that its future performance may not be as gloomy as indicated by its recent downturn.', 'Consumer staples companies specialize in producing or selling essential goods, such as toilet paper, bread, and toothpaste—items that people continue to purchase consistently, even in challenging economic circumstances or job loss. This consistent demand for essential products offers advantages for both consumer staples stocks and their investors. These benefits include reliable and predictable revenues, as well as resilience during economic downturns. When coupled with operational excellence, the top consumer staples stocks demonstrate a steady and gradual growth in earnings and cash flow over an extended period. Analysts are expressing optimism for the sector in 2024 due to these capabilities. Filippo Falorni, Vice President and Equity Research Analyst at Citi, shared with BNN Bloomberg his anticipation that consumer staple stocks, often regarded by investors as substitutes for bonds, will yield favorable returns throughout the current year. This expectation is rooted in the belief that these stocks will perform well amid a slowing U.S. economy. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“The consumer has been more resilient than expected … and as a result, sectors that are more offensive have performed better than staples, which tend to perform better when you have more concerns around the (macroeconomics). We’re starting to see a little bit of a slowdown in consumer spending … so I think staples, in general, can become more of a preferred sector as we head into particularly the second half of 2024.”', 'The onset of the pandemic has created new opportunities for the consumer staples sector, particularly with the surge in online shopping. The shift in consumer behavior towards digital platforms has become a notable avenue for growth within the sector. According to a recent report by Bloomberg Intelligence, digital commerce is projected to expand its share of total US retail sales significantly. Starting at 25% in 2022, the report forecasts that digital commerce will account for a third of all retail sales by the year 2027. This anticipated growth underscores the increasing prevalence and influence of online transactions in the retail landscape, highlighting a notable shift in consumer shopping habits over the coming years.', 'The digitalization of the consumer staples sector contributes to its defensive characteristics. While traditionally viewed as defensive due to the consistent demand for essential products, the integration of digital technologies adds an extra layer of resilience. The sector may not generate exceptionally high returns, but it also exhibits stability and is less prone to abrupt failures. Moreover, many of these stocks provide dividends, which can be viewed as a tangible return on investment even before substantial growth occurs. Walmart Inc.

During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has lost 1.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating a change of -49.1% from the year-ago quarter.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Occidental Petroleum's  ROE."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:', '19% = US$5.4b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.19 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To start with, Occidental Petroleum's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 23%. This probably goes some way in explaining Occidental Petroleum's significant 27% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio."", ""We then performed a comparison between Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 33% in the same 5-year period."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is OXY fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Occidental Petroleum has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 2.3%, meaning that it has the remaining 98% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Occidental Petroleum is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.', ""Besides, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 23% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Occidental Petroleum's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Mahoney', ""Thanks, Lauren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 2023 results were excellent, and our global performance represented one of the strongest years in company history, exceeding our financial goals that we set for the year. This performance is fueled by innovation and clinical evidence generation, commercial execution and the winning spirit of our global teams.In fourth quarter '23, total company operational sales grew 15% and organic sales grew 14% versus fourth quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Full year '23 operational sales growth of 13% versus 2022. While organic sales grew 12%, exceeding our guidance of approximately 11% for the full year. Importantly, 6 of our 8 business units grew sales double digit in the fourth quarter and double digits for the full year 2023 and all of our regions also grew double digits in the fourth quarter and double digits full year 2023. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy and our focus on innovation bolstered by commercial excellence.Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range $0.49 to $0.52. Full year adjusted EPS of $2.05 grew 20% versus 2022, also exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Q4 adjusted operating margin was 26.6% and full year '23 was 26.3%, which is exciting because it exceeds pre-pandemic levels. We generated full year cash flow of $1.8 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $2.5 billion, in line with our expectations.Now for our 2024 outlook. We expect healthy procedure volumes to continue in our guidance to organic growth of 7% to 9% for first quarter 2024 and 8% to 9% for the full 2024. Our Q1 '24 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.50 to $0.52. We expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.23 to $2.27, representing growth of 9% to 11%. This guidance excludes the acquisition of Axonics, which is expected to close in the first half of '24.Despite pressures on margins in '24 from FX headwinds as well as investments in manufacturing capacity and selling expenses to fuel our exciting launches, we remain committed to improving operating income margins in 2024 and to our goal of improving adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points in '24 to '26. And Dan will provide more details on those financials for both 2023 and 2024.I'll now provide additional highlights on '23 results along with comments on our outlook.

Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 12% on an operational basis versus Q4 '22 and 13% on a full year basis.

We're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our innovative EP portfolio, and further opportunity in our growth in emerging markets within the EMEA region.Asia Pacific grew 17% operationally versus Q4 in '19 versus the full year 2022, with all major markets growing strong double digits.

We expect our performance to improve in 2024 and with the recent launch of our U.S. WaveWriter Alpha DPN indication and the strong real-world data on FAST recently presented at NANS. Furthermore, with the completion of our Relievant Medsystems acquisition in the fourth quarter, we're excited about our ability to offer expanded pain portfolio that supports a comprehensive treatment algorithm, now including the novel Intracept system for the treatment of chronic low back pain. Peripheral Intervention sales were excellent also growing 12% operationally and 10% organically versus Q4 and a full year basis growing 13% operationally and 11% organically versus '22. Our Arterial growth was led by the performance of our drug-eluting portfolio both in Q4 and on a full year. This market remains underpenetrated with more than half the procedures still being used with bare-metal devices, underscoring the importance of our ongoing commitment to innovation and clinical evidence.In Venous, Q4 (inaudible) growth was led by Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein technology. Additionally, in fourth quarter, EKOS growth was supported by REAL-PE, the largest real-world and near real-time data set evaluating advanced therapies for pulmonary embolism patients.Our Interventional Oncology franchise performed extremely well in fourth quarter and in 2023, growing low double digits with strength across our portfolio of robust embolization technologies and cancer therapies. We continue to look to expand our clinical evidence and are pleased to have commenced enrollment in the ROWAN trial, which will access the safety and efficacy of use TheraSphere in combination with immunotherapy to treat HCC, the most common type of primary liver cancer.Cardiology delivered tremendous quarter -- delivered a tremendous fourth quarter and year, with both operational and organic sales growing 14% versus fourth quarter and for the full year 2022. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology therapy sales grew 10% for the full year and -- for the quarter and full year. On a full year basis, the Coronary Therapies franchise growth was driven by strong performance in our international regions and our Imaging franchise globally. AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon continues to perform very well in Japan, and we now expect approval of the AGENT in the U.S. in the first half of 2024. AGENT DCB will be the first coronary drug-eluting balloon in the U.S. indicator for instant restenosis providing physicians and patient solution for this unmet clinical need.Our Structural Heart Valves franchise grew double digits in both fourth quarter and on a full year basis, led by the performance of ACURATE neo2 in Europe, and we now have treated more than 70,000 patients to date with our ACURATE technology globally. As we look ahead, we anticipate approval of ACURATE Prime in Europe in 2025. However, after reviewing a planned interim analysis of the U.S. ACURATE IDE data, we will now wait for the full 1-year data from the RCT cohort of 1,500 patients to determine our regulatory strategy. Therefore, we no longer anticipate the approval of ACURATE Prime in the U.S. in 2024. Additionally, in alignment with the FDA, we are suspending enrollment in the single-arm continued access study while continuing to enroll in the randomized extended durability cohort. We expect to have more information in the second half of 2024 following the full data review.WATCHMAN sales grew 23% organically versus fourth quarter '22 and 25% on a full year basis. Q4 finished with record sales and strong utilization in all major markets, we have now treated over 400,000 patients globally with the WATCHMAN technology. U.S. Q4 growth of 23% was supported by the breadth of the portfolio and the initial launch of WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which we expect to move into full launch in the first quarter. We continue to expand the breadth of clinical evidence supporting this technology and are pleased with the pace of enrollment within our post-market HEAL-LAA trial, including our newly added cohort, which is studying in WATCHMAN FLX Pro and underrepresented patient populations. We also look forward to initiating our monotherapy trial, SIMPLIFY trial later this year, which will study WATCHMAN FLX Pro with a simplified post-implant drug regimen.Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically versus Q4 '22 and on a full year basis grew 6% organically versus '22. On a full year basis, our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits, outpacing market growth driven by broad portfolio and ongoing investments in innovation. In Core CRM, in both fourth quarter and on a full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low single digits and our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits. 2023 performance was driven by our differentiated high-voltage portfolio and shock polarity options. As we look ahead, we expect our Core CRM growth to be in line with the market performance in '24.Turning to Electrophysiology. Sales grew 43%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '22 and the full year basis grew 37% operationally and 33% organically versus '22. U.S. fourth quarter sales grew 40% organically driven by our POLARx launch and ongoing win with our Access Solutions portfolio. Our international EP growth accelerated in the fourth quarter growing 46% organically, fueled by improved FARAPULSE console supply, and we now have treated over 40,000 patients globally with the FARAPULSE technology to date. And with the news this morning that we received FDA approval for FARAPULSE, we are thrilled to enter the U.S. market immediately.We continue to invest in clinical evidence to study new indications and support access to our FARAPULSE technology. Late last year, we initiated the AVANT GUARD trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the system as a first-line treatment for persistent AF compared to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy. Additionally, a real-world data was presented at AHA for more than 17,000 patients treated with FARAPULSE in the MANIFEST-17K registry, which reinforced the real-world safety profile of the FARAPULSE platform, with no reports of permanent phrenic nerve palsy or pulmonary vein stenosis, or esophageal injury and an overall major adverse rate -- event rate of less than 1%. We're excited to bring this innovative technology to more markets and expect approval of FARAPULSE in Japan -- China and Japan, likely in the second half of this year.In closing, I'm very proud of our global team, what we are able to accomplish in '23, resulting in full year organic sales growth of 12% and adjusted EPS growth of 20%. We're excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our talent and sustaining the culture that's motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-range plan goals. Those goals as a reminder, are sales an average of 8% to 10% over the 3-year period while expanding adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth and improvement of our free cash flow conversion to approximately 70% in 2026.With all of that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials."", 'Daniel J. Brennan', ""Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3.725 billion represents 14.9% reported growth versus fourth quarter 2022 and includes a 40-basis-point tailwind from foreign exchange, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $12 million tailwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 14.5% in the quarter. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points resulting in 13.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Q4 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.49 to $0.52 primarily driven by our strong sales performance.For the full year 2023 consolidated revenue of $14.240 billion represents 12.3% reported revenue growth versus full year 2022 and includes an 80-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange, again, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $104 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth for the year was 13.1%. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 80 basis points resulting in 12.3% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of approximately 11%.Full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 grew 20% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.4% resulting in full year 2023 adjusted gross margin of 70.7%, in line with our expectations and representing a 20-basis-point improvement versus full year 2022, inclusive of a 220-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange.In 2024, we expect a mix benefit from our new launches with offsetting headwinds from FX and the incremental investment in our manufacturing capacity and as a result, we anticipate our full year 2024 adjusted gross margin will be at or slightly below our full year 2023 rate. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.6% resulting in a full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 26.3%, improving 70 basis points versus 2022. We expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2024 by another 30 to 50 basis points balancing progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points over the 3 years 2024 to 2026 with flexibility for critical investments to support key launches. On a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 15.7%, resulting in a full year reported operating margin of 16.5%.Moving to below the line, fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $79 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expense of $331 million, in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 10% and 11.2% for the full year 2023, including favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 14.6% for the fourth quarter and 13.9% for the full year, again, in line with expectations.Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.477 billion shares in Q4 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023. Free cash flow for the quarter was $718 million, with $984 million from operating activities, less $267 million of net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $913 million. Full year 2023 cash flow was $1.8 billion, and adjusted free cash flow was $2.5 billion both in line with expectations.For 2024, we expect full year free cash flow to be in excess of $2 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of expected payments related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash on hand of $865 million and our gross debt leverage was 2.3x. We expect to fund the Axonics acquisition through a mix of cash on hand and new debt, which will be determined prior to or at the time of close. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants.Our legal reserve was $377 million as of December 31, a decrease of $30 million versus the prior quarter, $108 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds.Now I'll walk through guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 8.5% to 9.5% versus 2023, excluding an approximate 50-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 9% to 10%, excluding a 100-basis-point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 9% versus 2023.We expect first quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 7.5% to 9.5% versus first quarter 2023, excluding an approximate 100-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect first quarter 2024 operational growth to be 8.5% to 10.5%, excluding a 150-basis-point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9% versus Q1 2023. We expect our full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $330 million.Under current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar Two rules, we forecast a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%. We continue to monitor tax legislation globally, including the currently drafted law to partially repeal U.S. R&D capitalization. If the law were to be passed as currently proposed we would expect a tailwind of approximately 100 basis points to our operational tax rate in 2024.We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.23 to $2.27 representing 9% to 11% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange at current rates and existing hedging contracts, which will be recognized ratably through the year. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.50 to $0.52. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2023 financial and operational highlights which outlines more details on Q4 and full year results and 2024 guidance.In closing, I'm very proud of our 2023 performance and look forward to executing on our 2024 guidance of 8% to 9% organic revenue growth, 30 to 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 11%.Before I turn it back over to Lauren for the Q&A, I wanted to provide a quick update. A key part of our talent strategy is moving high potential individuals throughout the company to give them a broad set of experiences. As part of this, effective March 1, Lauren Tengler will become the Global Controller for our Urology business unit providing financial leadership to the global business. And importantly, playing a key role in the integration of the Axonics business. Lauren previously spent many years within our Urology business, making her uniquely qualified for this opportunity.Following Lauren's transition, Jon Monson, currently our Chief Accounting Officer, will move to our Investor Relations function, leading (inaudible) and the rest of the team. I know the investment community will join me in thanking Lauren for her leadership and contributions and in welcoming Jon to the role.With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A."", 'Lauren Tengler', ""Thanks so much, Dan. Drew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. (Operator Instructions) Drew, please go ahead."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.', 'Robert Justin Marcus', ""Great. Congrats on a really good quarter. And congratulations, Lauren, on the promotion. Wanted to ask on two of the biggest product drivers in 2024, WATCHMAN and FARAPULSE. FARAPULSE got approval today. Wanted to see what's included in guidance for this year? And how to think about phasing over the year? How long will it take to get into hospitals and approved on formularies? And then second on WATCHMAN, look, still had a very good quarter in fourth quarter, but growth slowed a little bit. How should we be thinking about the potential for WATCHMAN and 20% plus growth in 2024?"", 'Michael F. Mahoney', ""Sure. Thanks, Robbie, for the comments. I'll start with WATCHMAN. It's just an excellent platform. With growth of 23% for the quarter, 25% for the full year, terrific work. And as you know, that product gets larger and larger for us. I had to cut the script back because the clinical investments we're making with WATCHMAN go on for a while, and we can touch on those if interested. But as you know, we continue to exceed likely 90% share in the U.S. We'll be rolling out WATCHMAN FLX Pro, more as a percent of our total mix in the U.S. in the first quarter and throughout the year. So you continue to see that, which is a differentiated platform. So with the clinical work that we're doing and the WATCHMAN FLX Pro and the [sterilizable sheet] likely to be in the market in 2024 as well. We continue to expect to gain share, and we aim to significantly widen the market opportunity through this clinical trial. So full steam ahead with WATCHMAN.On FARAPULSE, maybe the most exciting day I've had in my career at Boston Scientific with this platform that we have based on the results that we've seen in Europe and the enthusiasm globally for our PFA platform and to receive approval today was really exciting. We did anticipate a first quarter approval for FARAPULSE. And as you might expect, we expect to impact FARAPULSE to be somewhat in the first quarter and much more significant as the year goes on as we work with contracting with hospitals, getting on contract and getting the capital approved and rolling it out. But we have a lot of experience in doing that through our European success that we've enjoyed. Our team is trained. We have (inaudible) team. We continue to invest in it. So we're really excited about aiming to disrupt the EP market with what we think is the premier PFA platform."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.', 'Joanne Karen Wuensch', ""I don't want to leave FARAPULSE quite yet, and I suspect there will be a lot of questions on it this call. But if you're looking for China and Japan approval in the second half of '24, could you sort of outline what you think those opportunities may be? And then can you just give a quick highlight on some of the sort of higher profile cardiology companies such as POLAR and AGENT?"", 'Michael F. Mahoney', ""Yes. So, Ken can help me out. But obviously, China and Japan represent significant opportunities in the EP market. They're the largest markets that we compete in, in those countries, and we currently are under scale, particularly in China. In Japan, we've built a lot of momentum over the last, call it, 18 months with our POLARx launch. So in Japan, that grew, I don't know, I think over 40% our EP business. And so we have a more scaled commercial team capabilities in Japan and the eventual approval in the second half of this year in Japan with FARAPULSE will really be the next leg of the growth stool in Japan for us.So a lot of confidence there, the market in China may be even bigger. We're a bit more underscaled in China. So we'll be making a lot of investments there. We have a brand-new leader. We're excited about in China. It's around our EP business under June Chang, so we'll be making additional commercial investments, clinical investments and hope to have approval in the second half of the year in China. So those will be nice growth drivers for us in '24 more significant in 2025.And AGENT, Ken, do you want to comment a bit more on FARAPULSE? Dr. Stein?"", 'Kenneth M. Stein', ""I'd love to comment on FARAPULSE. Again, it is a very exciting day. Joanne, in terms of questions specifically about Japan and China, right? I think we got to realize, I mean, AFib is a global disease. I hate to use the word pandemic, but it is pandemic. Now -- and we're really pleased about the strength of the clinical trial data that we have as well as the commercial experience in Europe with, as Mike said, greater than 40,000 patients already treated to date. And it's that strength of the clinical data, right, that led us to the really, I think, rapid approval that we got from the FDA and that has led us to update our anticipated approval times, both in Japan and China. Again, I think having said that, we look to those approvals in the second half. So I don't think we're going to expect to really see too much material out of that until we get into 2025, but they are both large and important markets and large and important patient populations that are currently really very much underserved in terms of access to ablation technology."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.', 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', ""Congrats on a strong finish here and the approval of FARAPULSE in the U.S. On FARAPULSE, can you talk about the manufacturing capacity for the catheter and console upon launch? And expectations for the EP business this year, you grew 43% in Q4 '23. Any reason why growth would be lower in '24? And I have to ask you to please clarify your comments around ACURATE neo2, it sounds like something happened with Prime, which is the larger size, what are the implications for the other sizes of neo2 in Europe and the U.S.?"", 'Michael F. Mahoney', ""Thanks, Larry. Starting with FARAPULSE. Really very proud of the global supply chain team and what they've done over the past 18 months in the FARAPULSE group that we recently acquired a while ago. But they've done a tremendous in building the capabilities to supply this for the U.S. launch and to expand in Europe and eventually Asia, as we just highlighted. So we are now significantly improved our catheter and console supply. We opened numerous centers in Europe in the fourth quarter and we're ready to go. So we, at this point, don't anticipate supply being an issue to continue to support Europe or to facilitate the U.S. launch, given the capabilities and investments that we've made and approvals to manufacture in multiple locations. So great work by the supply chain team, and we're ready to launch this in the U.S.On ACURATE neo2, as I mentioned in the earnings script, maybe just 2 overall points, we continue to do very well with ACURATE neo2 in Europe. Implanting, I think the number is 70,000 and continue to grow faster than the market in Europe. And we are on track for what we have is called Prime in Europe in 2025. So that continues to move forward as planned.With respect to the trial, as I mentioned in the script, based on the interim analysis, we now need to wait for the full 1-year follow-up of 1,500 patients. And as a result of that, we don't -- we will not be receiving approval for ACURATE neo in 2024, and we will wait until likely near the end of 2024 for the full readout of the ACURATE IDE study to determine our path forward."", 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', 'Congrats, Lauren.', 'Lauren Tengler', 'Thanks, Larry.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.', 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Congrats on a really strong finish year. Maybe just one on the guidance here, perhaps for Dan. Dan, the 8% to 9%, it looks like FARAPULSE, the prior guide assumed a back half launch. It's coming in a little bit ahead. Can you just walk us through that 8% to 9%? Is that right that FARAPULSE perhaps assumptions have changed? Any impact from VBP or days impact that we should be aware of? And what are you assuming for pricing in fiscal '24?"", 'Daniel J. Brennan', ""Sure. So the VBP assumptions are the same as they've always been, really no change there. As you saw in December when we issued the press release on AVANT GUARD, we moved up the timing of expected FARAPULSE launch to Q1. So we've been anticipating Q1 launch and that 8% to 9% full year and the 7% to 9% for the first quarter in terms of revenue growth contemplated a Q1 approval of FARAPULSE. As Mike said, there's probably some contribution in Q1, but more of that contribution comes in Q2 to Q4. So the 8% to 9% has that contemplated in the overall guide. And then pricing. So what I would say on pricing is we were basically flat in 2023 and the goal is to be flat again in 2024. So likely no impact would be the goal in 2024 versus 2023."", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', 'Sorry, on days, Dan. Any days impact here?', 'Daniel J. Brennan', ""No, all the days, there's a lot of -- obviously, a lot of noise and days around the world through the year. It's all contemplated in guidance, all in the 8% to 9% for the full year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.', 'Danielle Joy Antalffy', ""Just a follow-up question on ACURATE neo2, Mike, if I could. So appreciate the comments that you did provide. Just curious, I mean, obviously, you're giving pretty strong guidance here for 2024. I mean is the right read here that regardless of what happens with ACURATE neo2 and timing there, you're sticking to your long-term sales growth guidance that you provide back in September. And sort of how do we think about this as a long-term growth contributor now given this little wrinkle here? And Lauren, we will miss you very much."", 'Michael F. Mahoney', ""Lauren is not leaving the company. She will be around. You're probably going to see her..."", 'Danielle Joy Antalffy', ""We won't get to see her, so..."", 'Lauren Tengler', ""I'll work my way in."", 'Michael F. Mahoney', ""Okay. We'll work her way in, once in a while. We're excited for Jon to come in and Lauren to move out. No, no, I'm excited for Lauren to go to Urology.Yes. So to answer your question, we are fully committed to the 8% to 10% organic growth CAGR over the '24 to '26 period that we provided at Investor Day, absolutely no change in that outlook. And pleased with the '23 performance, as you know, where we grew 12%. So absolutely no change to those financial goals.ACURATE continues to do well in Europe. It's a product that's used every day by many European physicians, and we're excited about getting the larger size approved there. We are disappointed that we didn't get ACURATE over the goal line for approval in 2024. So at this point, we need to wait until the full data sets have been followed up for a year and read out likely for the end of this year in 2024, and we'll take it from there in terms of the U.S. launch. But we are disappointed we're not going to launch that really very end of this year and into the next. But absolutely no change to our financial guidance that we gave at Investor Day."", 'Danielle Joy Antalffy', ""Okay. Great. And also welcome, Jon. Sorry, I didn't mean to leave you out."", 'Jonathan R Monson', 'Thanks, Danielle.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America.', 'Travis Lee Steed', ""Maybe one more follow-up on TAVR. Could you remind us what the interim look was? Was that just like a 6-month look at the data, now you need to wait for a 1-year data for the line to separate? I'm curious if you think what you saw in the interim look, are you still pretty confident that at 1 year, we could have a U.S. TAVR launch? Or does this put the whole U.S. TAVR launch at risk?"", 'Michael F. Mahoney', 'All right. Are you able to hear us okay?', 'Travis Lee Steed', 'Yes, I can hear you loud and clear.', 'Michael F. Mahoney', 'Great. Dr. Sathananthan is our Chief Medical Officer, as you know, for ICTx and Structural Heart, maybe he could comment a bit.', 'Janar Sathananthan', ""Yes, I'll take the comment just about the data. So essentially, what happened in the trial was that as part of a planned interim analysis, we made the decision to await the full 1-year data. It is important just to note that the ACURATE IDE study is still an active clinical study with active clinical follow-up. And so as a result, we cannot disclose any data related to the trial at this time. We will expect, as Mike said, a readout of the study in the second half of 2024 following a full data review."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.', 'Joshua Thomas Jennings', ""Congratulations for a strong end of the year. I wanted to ask about the international cardiac ablation market. Boston has incredible fourth quarter, 40-plus percent growth, some of your competitors delivered really strong international growth in their Electrophysiology businesses as well. What's going on in the international market? I mean, are we seeing the promise of PFA driving market expansion this early? Or is there any pricing dynamics going on, but I think it's 20% almost market growth in internationally for cardiac ablation this year. Just wanted to get some details there and whether that could translate to PFA launches in the United States driving market expansion, which I think you guys have detailed in your Investor Day?"", 'Michael F. Mahoney', 'Dr. Stein, do you want to take a shot at it?', 'Kenneth M. Stein', ""Yes, Josh. And thanks, Mike. I think it's a couple of factors here. And I don't think it's -- I don't know that I can parse out for you how much is getting contributed from each. But again, I think we just begin with the fact, right? That atrial fibrillation is an incredibly common arrhythmia. Again, as I said earlier, it is literally pandemic worldwide. I know, for instance, in the U.S., right? 1/4 of adults over the age of 40 will experience AFib at things in our live. And ablation even with legacy thermal technologies, things for us like StablePoint or POLARx is incredibly effective. It's more effective in drugs. But on a global scale, it is still really incredibly underpenetrated as a market. And much of the growth that you see really just reflects, I think, increasing realization in the cardiology community, the referring physician community about the relative efficacy and safety of all ablation technologies.And then you layer on top of that the promise and the data with FARAPULSE, right? And FARAPULSE again takes a procedure that's already effective. It is at least as effective, it is clearly safer. And it's also much more efficient than thermal ablation. And so that enables Docs and medical centers to scale this out much better, right? And start to get into this underpenetrated population. So maybe a long-winded answer, but the short answer is, right? It's both a dramatically underpenetrated population to begin with. And then on top of that, you have the accelerated impact of FARAPULSE."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.', 'Richard Samuel Newitter', ""Congrats on a really strong finish to the year. My first question is just going back to TAVR. At your Analyst Day, you had talked to an expectation and the level of confidence that you could disrupt that market in the U.S. relatively quickly out of the gate. I'm just curious with -- I guess something approaching 20% share of the market over time, which is what you've done in other markets with your disruption capabilities. I'm just curious, does anything change there with the indeterminate kind of view of what the next steps are for the U.S.? I'm just trying to focus on that commentary a bit. Does your outlook for the franchise in the U.S. change in TAVR? And then I have a follow-up."", 'Michael F. Mahoney', ""Yes. Just a few clarifying points. Again, in Europe, where we set 70,000 valves and physicians use it routinely on an everyday basis. We continue to grow faster than the market there and have continued to done that for, I don't know, 10 quarters in a row. So we make nice progress, and we're excited about getting the large valve size approved in Europe. I believe 2025 is the time period.In the U.S., honestly, we -- first of all, I would state that we've never quoted a market share goal for TAVR in the U.S. So we never set 20%, I'm not sure if that was what you put in your models or not. But based on the results that we've seen in Europe, we've always been confident in our ability to have ACURATE be a meaningful growth driver in the U.S. as we stated at Investor Day.As a result of this, we are disappointed that we're not going to have this launched in 2024, as we talked about based on the data that we just highlighted in the script, and as Janar mentioned, we now need to wait for the full year data, the full 1-year follow-up on the 1,500 patients, and then working with the FDA and submitting that and having that data read out by year-end and we'll take it from there.So we -- as Janar said, the trial is still active. So we do not expect any of this news to alter our 8% to 10% organic growth over the 3-year period, we're coming off at 12%. We continue to grow faster than most all of our peers and drop EPS faster than our peer group. And we're still very committed to those financial targets. And we're hopeful that ACURATE will continue to be a big growth driver for us, but a lot of it depends on that data readout in fourth quarter '24."", 'Richard Samuel Newitter', ""Okay. And then maybe just on M&A, you've been active in 2023, and congrats on Relievant and more recently Axonics early this year. I'm just curious on kind of how we should think about how aggressive and opportunistic will be over the next 12 months? You mentioned, obviously, your first priority remains, deploying capital for tuck-ins but do we kind of think of you guys in a little bit of a digestion period or kind of steady as she goes, just as aggressive and opportunistic as you have been in the past?"", 'Daniel J. Brennan', ""Sure. I can take that one. So as you mentioned, Axonics, the most recent deal we did, super pleased with that. I think that is a classic tuck-in for Boston Scientific. It's one I think -- as you look back, these types of deals, we really do well with, and we're super excited to have that close and welcome the Axonics team into the BSE family.As you said, we've been remarkably consistent over a long period of time. Tuck-in M&A is still the #1 capital allocation priority for us, and we'll continue to be active. In terms of the -- how active over the near to medium term, this is not a major event like a major delevering event that we need to do. This is take on a little bit of additional debt over a period of time and then over a very reasonable period of time. We'll be right back to where we are today relative to our leverage goals. So I'd look for us to continue to be active in the tuck-in M&A space in '24 and beyond."", 'Richard Samuel Newitter', 'Okay. Again, congrats on an outstanding 4Q.', 'Michael F. Mahoney', 'Thank you.', 'Daniel J. Brennan', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley.', 'Patrick Wood', ""Congrats, Lauren. I'd like to stick with Axonics, if that's right. I appreciate it hasn't closed yet. But I'm just kind of curious, Urology in Boston has a very sizable distribution network across, I guess, primarily stone management, but a whole bunch of different areas. How are you thinking about the ability to drive adoption in OAB faster and like really push that asset? I'm guessing having just played with the numbers and correct me if I'm wrong, but some assumption of slightly faster growth once you've acquired Axonics and the Street previously had in there, at least that's where I end up with the numbers, feel free to correct me, but how are you thinking about the commercialization and really pushing that through the distribution network?"", 'Michael F. Mahoney', ""Sure. Well, we haven't closed it yet. We hope to first half of this year. The team at Axonics has done an amazing job with this platform since starting the company years ago and taking significant share in what is a strong double-digit growth market. The team at Axonics, I can't speak too much for them, it hasn't closed yet, as also done a remarkable job in a few areas, one -- core technology where they gained -- leverage that to gain share. The clinical data that they have, the commercial excellence that they possess and also expanding the market through their direct-to-patient marketing and awareness. So this is a significant global opportunity and the patient awareness of this treatment is still early days. And so that's one reason why we acquired the company was the momentum they have, the technology and the long-term market CAGR that we see based on the global opportunity.The market today is nearly all of U.S. That's something we'll evaluate more in the future here as to would it make sense for us to bring this to select markets outside the U.S. given the data that we have.As you mentioned, we have a significant commercial channel in our Urology business through all of our different business units within Urology. So this is an ideal fit. It is an adjacency for us. We don't have any competitive product in this area. So it's a nice adjacency for us that will allow us to compete more competently with Urology customers. But we aim to take Axonics to the next level, but that team has done a terrific job to date."", 'Operator', 'And just to verify, do we have time for one more question?', 'Lauren Tengler', 'Yes. One last question please.', 'Operator', 'That question will come from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research.', 'Michael K. Polark', ""I'll ask a gross margin question. Dan, I heard in the script for '24 flat to maybe slightly down year-on-year in the guide. The world seems to be calmer on price cost. But as we all know, the Middle East is flaring. And so I'm curious, one, have you built in any cushion for kind of cost push from those events? And two, in real time, are you seeing any impact in the field? And if so, what does that look like?"", 'Daniel J. Brennan', ""Yes, I can give you the short answer and a little bit longer answer. So the short one is that we've contemplated all that. Our team is super close to everything relative to our global supply chain network. And so there everything that we have in the guidance that we gave contemplates what we know today and what -- and the guidance that they're giving us on that, which -- the impact is minimal.Overall, on gross margin, a little bit longer answer. If you look at '23, we came in pretty much right where we expected at that 70.7%. And then as we said at the Investor Day in September, we said it would be a challenge to contribute to our margin expansion goals in '24, right, which that's probably going to prove out to be true. Because we're saying, we'll be either at or slightly below. But that's okay. As there are many other areas of the P&L. And as you know, we have a pretty solid track record over time of managing all those lines of the P&L to drive margin expansion. Most recently, that's 70 basis points last year.So for '24, I'd kind of point to 2 headwinds and 2 tailwinds that will play out and again, have us at that kind of at or slightly below the 70.7% we put up last year. And one is inflation. And that's probably a little bit of a tailwind, right? So it's -- the macro factors are improving in general relative to inflation and other things. But as a reminder, we enter into contracts for many elements of materials for '24 already last year. So we don't want to see that full benefit. But in '25 and '26, I'd like to believe there's even more benefit there, not only from the macro side of inflation, but also for gross margin in total.And then our mix. So getting the FARAPULSE approval today, that's exciting because that's a great mix thing for the company and many of our other launches are as well. And then on the headwind side, foreign exchange was a headwind in '23 continue in '24. And as I said at Investor Day, a good problem to have, but we also need to make investments in manufacturing capacity to support the sales growth, growing 12% last year and then 8% to 9% this year. But we're absolutely committed to the 150 basis points over 3 years. Gross margin probably won't pay a lot of bills for us in '24 but I think it certainly will in '25 and '26. Recall, we used to be north of 72% back in 2019, and we are maniacally focused to get there. And then to get the overall operating margin kind of on the doorstep of '28 when we get to 2026 and that puts that 30% long-term goal that we've had kind of right in our line of sight as we're in 2026."", 'Lauren Tengler', ""Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. If we were unable to get to your question or if you have any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team.

Its operations span across a network of independent bottlers and distributors, with significant revenue generated from its flagship sodas and diversified drink portfolio. Delving into Coca-Cola's dividend stock profile, we observe a company that's not at the pinnacle among US dividend payers but nonetheless showcases merits for consideration. Over the past five years, Coca-Cola has trimmed its debt-to-equity ratio significantly and sustained earnings growth, albeit at a pace below its own historical average. The firm's profit margins have improved modestly year over year, indicating efficiency gains."", ""Coca-Cola’s dividends are well-supported by both earnings and cash flow—crucial indicators of sustainability—with a history of reliability over the last decade. However, it’s worth noting that while dividends have been growing consistently, their yield doesn't compete with the top quartile in the US market. Additionally, while debt levels are high relative to equity, they are comfortably serviced by operating cash flow and interest payments are well covered by profits—a reassuring sign for investors focused on stability rather than aggressive growth. In summary, Coca-Cola presents itself as a steady ship with modest growth forecasts; it may not dazzle among dividend stocks but offers dependability in shareholder returns amidst shifting market tides. Unlock comprehensive insights into our analysis of Coca-Cola stock."", ""Exxon Mobil, a titan in the oil and gas industry since 1870, casts a wide net with operations spanning from crude oil and natural gas exploration to the production of specialty chemicals and performance products. Its financial backbone is supported by robust segments like Energy Products in both the US and international markets, which contribute significantly to its revenue stream. In analyzing Exxon Mobil as a dividend stock, we find a mixed bag; while it's not leading the pack in terms of yield among US companies, there are bright spots. The company has managed to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio modestly over five years and maintains satisfactory debt levels backed by strong operating cash flow—over 150% coverage—which speaks well for financial health. Earnings have seen notable growth annually over half a decade but have recently hit a snag with negative growth this past year."", 'Dividend sustainability appears solid with low payout ratios ensuring that dividends are comfortably covered by earnings and cash flows alike. Despite dividends growing over the past decade, their yield remains shy of top-tier status when compared against peers. Looking ahead though, projections suggest both earnings and revenue may face headwinds with expected declines on the horizon. Nonetheless, interest payments on debt are exceedingly well-covered by profits—a reassuring detail for those prioritizing income stability from their investments.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the bottled water industry, you may go to 5 Highest Quality Bottled Water Brands in The US.', 'Bottled water usage is high where there is a lack of trust in the public water supply services. This can mean two things: one, the quality of water being provided by public water supplies is not high-quality or may even be contaminated, and two: the consumers do not trust the quality of public water supply and prefer bottled water instead. As a small example: a report by WebMD highlights US tap water to have acidic water ranging from 4.3 to 5.3 on the pH scale instead of healthy drinking water which is supposed to be marked at 7 on the pH scale.', 'On the consumer side, there seems to be a rise in health concerns for the contents of bottled water itself, including the source, carbonation, total dissolved solids, and pH levels. This phenomenon has been highlighted in our article on the Best Water Damage Restoration Services in Each of 30 Biggest Cities in the US.', 'The popularity of bottled water has taken this market to a value of USD 26.12 billion according to a\xa0report by Coherent Market Insights.

Private Labels currently take up around 25% of the total market according to one report by one report by the Beverage Industry. The same report indicates that the leading brands in the bottled-water market in the US are Aquafina, Dasani, and Glaceau Smartwater, capturing around 8.5, 8.2 and 6.7% of the total bottled market industry, respectively. Diving deeper into understanding these industry leaders, we see that they are run by familiar faces of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) making Aquafina, and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) making Dasani and Smartwater both.', ""These industry leaders have utilized some key ways to reduce cost and move towards sustainability as a source of market differentiation. The most obvious example of this was The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO)'s move towards making Dasani's packaging from 100% recycled PET in 2022. Even prior to that PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) after much deliberation launched aluminum cans as packaging for Aquafina in 2020. On the other hand, The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO)'s strategy with Smartwater for differentiation in the market has been through advertisement and endorsements. The most recent example of this is acclaimed actor Zendaya's endorsement of Smartwater announced in August 2023."", 'By this point, it should be understood that bottled water has a sizable and growing market and quality has begun to become a major deciding factor for consumers. The question then is: why does the content of bottled water matter so much? It is because not all bottled water is made equal. While there are differences in taste that may be important to consumers, the health impacts may be even more important. For instance, magnesium content varies significantly from one brand to another and this meta-analysis by the National Library of Medicine has highlighted that water with high magnesium may be linked to lower risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).', 'Having understood that there is a quality-conscious consumer segment in the sizeable and growing bottled water industry in the US and that there is a benefit to having better quality water, we sought to rank the top 15 highest quality bottled water brands in the US.', ""Let's now head over to the list of the highest quality bottled-water brands in the US."", 'Copyright: bee32 / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Since measuring the quality of this essential product is very subjective, we have used the consensus approach to collect data for this article.

The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Should You Invest in KO?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $2.68.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coke.

My name is Luke, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir."", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter, Mako performance insights, and updates on recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results and 2024 guidance before opening the call to Q&A. First, I want to recognize and celebrate our achievement of surpassing $20 billion in sales. We continue to be a high-growth company with a focus on our mission to deliver for our patients and customers. As we begin 2024, I am very excited about our future. We are in a strong position with robust demand across both procedures and capital, easing macro constraints and a strong pipeline of innovation. I want to thank our over 50,000 employees for their unrelenting determination, agility and performance. We've delivered terrific sales growth of over 11% in Q4 and the full year despite strong comparatives from the prior year. Our commercial execution, including many successful product introductions, was excellent across our businesses and regions. Globally, for both Q4 and the full year, we had double-digit organic sales growth in Instruments, Endoscopy, Medical, Neuro Cranial, Hips, Knees and Trauma and Extremities. For the full year, we also had double-digit organic sales growth both in the U.S. and internationally. Spine and Neurovascular also demonstrated good performances while making notable advancements in future innovations and acquisitions. It was a comprehensive performance across our businesses, and we have built significant momentum entering 2024. For the sixth straight year, our international sales growth, excluding China VBP, outpaced our strong U.S. business. Canada, Australia and most emerging markets had double-digit growth, while Europe and Japan grew in high single digits. International continues to be a large growth opportunity for us. Next, we delivered quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $3.46 and $10.60, respectively, which represents 15% growth for Q4 and 13% growth compared to the full year of 2022. This was driven by our strong sales but also demonstrates our continued operating margin recovery. We remain focused on driving high growth now and in the future through investments in organic innovation and M&A. We expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our full year 2024 guidance of organic sales growth of 7.5% to 9%. This growth, combined with an accelerated margin expansion plan, translates to adjusted EPS of $11.70 to $12 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason."", 'Jason Beach', 'Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as Mako, Vocera and our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF. During the quarter, we saw strong procedural demand. We continue to expect the ortho markets will remain strong in 2024, driven by continued adoption in robotic-assisted surgery, demographics, a more favorable pricing environment, and healthy patient activity levels with surgeons. While supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe, our supply is stable overall and gradually improving. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained very robust in the quarter, with double-digit organic growth in Medical, Instruments and Endoscopy. Hospital CapEx budgets remain healthy, and our capital order book remains elevated as we enter 2024. Next, specific to Mako, we had a record quarter of installations globally. The progress of our Mako offense, including our recent direct-to-consumer campaign, has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we saw 60% of Knees and 34% of Hips performed using Mako as we exited the year. Globally, we exited the year with just over 40% of Knees and nearing 20% of Hips performed using Mako. We have momentum, and a significant opportunity remains as Mako adoption increases. We are nearing the 2-year anniversary of our Vocera acquisition and remain very excited about the acquired assets, as it provides a platform for us to be at the intersection of medical devices, software and clinical support. With integration activities now complete, which included a migration towards the cloud as well as the commercial reorganization, we are pleased with the accelerating double-digit sales and order growth achieved as we exited the year. In 2023, we saw many cross-sell wins, including new bed business leveraging Vocera. Also, we completed the seamless experience created between the Vocera platform and both ProCuity and our new wireless structure. This year and beyond will bring even more integrations and enhancements with a focus on scalability, user experience, automated workflow and documentation. We expect strong double-digit annual sales growth to continue for years to come, and we are excited to have Vocera as part of the Stryker family. Lastly, we are progressing with our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF, and we expect the deal will close this quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.', 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.4% in the quarter, compared to 13.2% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 has the same number of selling days as 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.3% favorable impact on sales in the quarter. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12.7%. International organic sales growth was 7.7%, against a very strong comparable of over 18% in 2022. This performance included positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Japan and most emerging markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 11.5%, with U.S. organic sales growth of 11.7% and international organic sales growth of 10.9%. Excluding the impact of China VBP, international growth was 12.8%. The impact for pricing in the year was favorable 0.6%. Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact, and 2023 has the same number of selling days as 2022. Our adjusted EPS of $3.46 in the quarter was up 15.3% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion as well as lower other income and expenses. Foreign currency exchange translation had a favorable impact of $0.02. Our full year adjusted EPS was $10.60, which represents growth of 13.5% from full year 2022, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.10. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12% and organic sales growth of 11.8%, which included 13.8% of U.S. organic growth and 5.7% of international growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.5%, with strong double-digit growth across its Surgical Technologies and Orthopaedic Instruments businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, Steri-Shield, smoke evacuation and SurgiCount. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.9%, with double-digit growth in its communications, endo BU and Sports Medicine businesses. From a product perspective, this includes strong growth in booms, lights and video. During the quarter, the Endoscopy business continued to see very strong momentum of the 1788 camera system, which had its full launch in September. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by performances in its Vocera, Acute Care and Sage businesses. This included strong growth in Vocera badges, beds, structures and Prevalon repositioning products. All of this was against a very strong comparable growth of over 20% in 2022. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 7.6%, reflecting solid performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neuro Cranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 14%, which included double-digit growth in the Neurosurgical and ENT businesses, with strong growth in high-speed drill and balloon dilation products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 5.7%, reflecting double-digit growth in our Instruments and Neuro Cranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Australia, Canada and Japan. Orthopaedics and Spine had constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.7%, which included organic growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and 10.1% internationally. Our U.S. knee business grew 12.9% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. hip business also grew 12.9% organically, reflecting solid primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 12.1% organically with strong performances across all of its businesses, including upper extremities, biologics, core trauma, and foot and ankle. Our U.S. spine business grew 6%, led by the performance in our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 10.1% organically, including strong performances in Canada and most emerging markets, particularly driven by Mako and strong knee performance across most geographies. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorably -- was favorable approximately 120 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by the continued easing of certain cost pressures, including the elimination of spot buy purchases that we experienced in 2022 and the continued benefit of pricing initiatives. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.6% of sales, which was 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. Our adjusted SG&A was 31% of sales, which was 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022 due to continued investments, including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings. In summary, for the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 27.2% of sales, which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales, a 40 basis point increase over 2022. This performance is mainly driven by the easing of certain gross margin cost pressures throughout the second half of the year as well as the positive impact of our pricing actions. Adjusted other income and expense of $31 million for the quarter was $23 million lower than 2022, mainly driven by higher interest income and other favorable discrete items. For 2024, we expect our full year other income and expense to be approximately $250 million. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.6% and 14.1%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2024, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13 billion. During the year, we paid down the remaining $850 million outstanding on the $1.5 billion term loan associated with the Vocera acquisition and achieved our de-leveraging commitments. In Q4, we also refinanced certain debt maturities, including prefunding of $600 million that is due in May 2024. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was $3.7 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. For 2024, we anticipate that capital spending will be $650 million to $700 million. We do not anticipate any share buybacks. And now I will provide 2024 full year sales and earnings guidance. Based on our momentum from 2023, strong procedural volumes, healthy demand for capital products and a stabilizing macro and economic environment, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9% for 2024. There is 1 additional selling day in 2024 compared to 2023, with 1 less day in Q1 and 1 more day in both Q3 and Q4. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we would expect the full year impact of price to be roughly flat. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be modestly unfavorably impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. EPS will be negatively impacted $0.05 to $0.10. This is included in our guidance. Finally, for the full year 2024, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.70 to $12, representing our commitment to accelerated operating margin expansion in 2024 as well as the stabilizing operating environment. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we do expect seasonality for sales and related earnings to be similar to 2023, but adjusted for the quarterly differences in 2024 selling days. And now I will open up the call for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.', 'Robert Justin Marcus', ""Congrats on another fantastic quarter. Kevin, maybe to start, I feel like it's a bit of deja vu where we were sitting here at exactly this time last year and investors were starting to worry after a good year in 2022 and how good can 2023 be. And now people are wondering about '24. So I was hoping you could give a little color behind the 7.5% to 9% organic sales growth. How much of that is transitory? How much of that is durable pricing? And any key drivers you could point us to?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""It certainly was a terrific year in 2023. We had 9.7% organic the year before and over 11% organic in '23. And frankly, we feel very good going into '24. At some point, you think the comps will start to catch up too a little bit, and so we think 7.5% to 9% is a strong guide. I can tell you, coming off all of the domestic sales meetings, there is tremendous energy and excitement among our teams. Procedure volumes are strong. The capital markets are very strong. Hospitals are spending. We have exited the year with more backlog than we began the year, which means, obviously, our orders are continuing to be strong for capital equipment. So we have a number of new launches, again, planned in 2024. Obviously, 2023 was a great year of capitalizing on product launches, whether it's System 9, whether it was Neptune S, whether it was the 1788. We have other launches coming again, so our pipeline of innovation is very strong. And so I expect us to continue to grow at the high end of med tech in a med tech market that is quite healthy."", 'Robert Justin Marcus', ""Great. Maybe, Glenn, a follow-up for you. And I appreciate you don't guide quarterly, but there's a lot you could do to help us get models in the right spot based on what you can say. And I guess really, the question is my math is implying 50 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. You talked about the top line should look like 2023. And I imagine that looks like a normal comparable quarter in first quarter and maybe some sharper seasonality, then historically down 3Q, up 4Q. Also, anything down the P&L operating margin that we should be considering in that seasonality?"", 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""I think, Robbie -- and I tried to sort of lay this out at the end of my guidance there. But I think a good place to start would be to look at sort of the cadence of sales and earnings in 2023 and really just adjust out for 1 selling day in Q1 and then adding 2 on the back end. And so as you look at, hey, Stryker, how are you going to deliver op margin expansion throughout the year? It's probably a little more back half-loaded just based on the cadence that we'll see through the year for sales and related op income."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.', 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', ""I'll echo Robbie's congratulations on a really strong year and finish to the year. Kevin, I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on M&A headed into 2024. Your focus has been on paying down debt in 2023. Is your focus in '24 on smaller deals? Are you open to considering something larger? And are the target areas the same as the ones you shared at the orthopaedic meeting last year? And I have one follow-up."", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""I would say that we're back on M&A offense now, what I'll call our normal M&A offense. And as you've seen in the past with Stryker, that would typically mean larger volume of tuck-in deals. And those can be large, and they can also be small. But during the pause, while we paid down debt, all of our BD teams worked very actively. Believe me, they have a long list of targets. And we are going to be active now that we've gotten our leverage back to where we'd like to be. So let's say we're back to the normal Stryker offense. Expect us to be doing deals. We are open to larger deals. But our history would tell you that the vast majority of our deals are going to be the smaller tuck-ins, but we can do many deals versus being very limited last year."", 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', ""Glenn, to follow up on Robbie's question on the margins. First, is it coming -- the margin expansion coming, how much is coming from gross margin versus operating margin? And are you committed still to the 200 basis points, getting back to the pre-COVID margin by 2025? I mean, it actually -- I don't know if the math -- not to get too much into it, but it looks like -- I thought it looked like over 100 basis points implied in the guidance this year. So I assume we can all figure that out off-line, but just any color on gross versus operating margin and the 200 basis points for the 2-year sprinting back to pre-COVID margins would be helpful."", 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""Larry, I think, first of all, we're not backing off of our sprint to 2019 op margin at all. And we have clearly a plan to get there by the end of 2025. As I said in the Analyst Day, we have good opportunities in operating expenses and in gross margin. I think if you look at our delivery in 2023, we got about 80 basis points out of gross margin. And we invested in some operating expenses that we had indicated would get back to sort of normalized spend. So my thoughts on 2024 is that expansion will generally be led by operating expenses, but there continues to be really good opportunities in gross margins that we continue to work on. And if you think about some of these things, price isn't going away from us. We're still going to continue to work on that. Viju elaborated on the benefit we have of low-cost manufacturing sites, and we'll continue to see expansion there. We have opportunities in purchasing and procurement, supplier consolidation. On the OpEx side, we'll continue to expand into shared services in some of these low-cost areas where we have those. And then honestly, from OpEx, we have a lot of natural leverage. It just comes when you're growing at the rate that we're growing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.', 'Ryan Benjamin Zimmerman', ""So I want to ask about orthopaedics. It's just been stellar performance, and we've heard from you and one of your peers. And Kevin, I just would appreciate if you can kind of characterize the confidence that this continues to persist for '24. And how are you improving or what are you doing to improve potentially productivity on the Mako unit to capture the demand that's continuing to be so strong?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""We're delighted with the progress that we've made. 60% of U.S. knees being done on the robot is pretty remarkable, given how long ago we launched the total knee application and seeing hips starting to really climb since we launched the 4.0 software has been terrific. Cementless continues to climb as well. And that tends to index much higher with the use of Mako. And as you know, we are clearly the leader in not just in robotic-assisted surgery, but clearly the leader in cementless as well. So a lot of good things going on with a market that is obviously a little better than it has been historically. But Mako continues to be the engine of growth, and that's true in the hospital. That's true in the ASCs as well. And we're seeing continued growth in ASC, where our Stryker offense is really winning at pretty spectacular rates as it relates to new builds and big renovations. So we have a lot of momentum across all of those dimensions, which translates to terrific performance as you saw with Hips and Knees. But the other part of our story is Trauma and Extremities. So the Wright Medical acquisition has been a complete home run of a deal, and you're seeing that. And not only has it been great for our Extremities business but enabled us to focus a lot more on our core Trauma business. And we really had all of our businesses in Trauma and Extremities humming as we exited the year and some great product launches towards the end of the year and some more to come in 2024."", 'Ryan Benjamin Zimmerman', ""Okay. And then maybe turning to Medical because it is now, I think, the biggest unit inside the company. And the comps are increasingly tougher in the first half of this year. It's been exemplary growth through late '22 and then in the first half of '23. Inside of that, you talked about Vocera continuing to be a double-digit grower. But if you can level set us on the entire portfolio, how do you think about the ability of that business to continue to be accretive to overall growth? And maybe what the appropriate expectations are around the Medical segment given how much is in that segment?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Look, we love our Medical business. And frankly, it's become a big and very fast-growing business. We continue to expect it to grow above Stryker's average growth rate. That is going to be true for the next 5 years. From quarter-to-quarter, it does bounce around a little bit because, of course, there's capital. A lot of large capital within Medical, but you also have increasingly more stable revenue with Sage, which is doing [attack] as well. Then you've got obviously the AED demand, which has exploded, and we have a terrific AED business. Tremendous innovation. We launched the Xpedition stair chair in the early part of the year, the first powered stair chair, which the firehouses absolutely love. And then you've got a lot of new demand for the wireless connection, wireless stretchers. So just tremendous innovation, tremendous leadership position, and now a much more diverse set of businesses than we had historically. So I think Medical is the business in Stryker that's the most underestimated because AEDs are high growth, our power costs are high growth. And now our bed business is doing really well behind ProCuity, and then you have Vocera in addition to that. So really, I would expect high growth from all of those different businesses, Sage, Vocera, beds, stretchers, AEDs because of innovation that we're constantly innovating. And we have a couple of big launches in Medical coming this year as well, so it's an exciting time to be at Medical. And we also have an outstanding leadership team. They've really focused on talent for years and years and years. And so I'm very bullish on Medical. And I think, again, whatever people have in their models, we've tended to beat in Medical if you go back for the last [6] years."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.', 'Joanne Karen Wuensch', ""Very nice end to the year. I'm curious about where you are in your super cycle. And not to use sports analogy, but are you halfway through? Half time? Or you have a couple more innings to go? I know I'm mixing my metaphors there. And also, sort of similarly, AAOS, what should we be expecting for that?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""I'll take the first part, and then Jason can talk about AAOS. Look, I would say that our pipeline of innovation is incredibly strong. When I mentioned the term super cycle, that really was referring to, let's call them, big platform launches. But the reality is we're driving tremendous growth even in some of the divisions that don't have big platform growth launches, if you think about upper extremities, you think about foot and ankle. But I would say the big ones coming up, we have this Pangea launch within our core trauma business, which is a big platform launch. We have a new defibrillator that's coming, of course, pending FDA approval. It's a PMA device, but we're very excited. That's what I would call a big platform launch. We have Mako spine coming in the third quarter of this year. That's another big platform launch towards the end of the year. We have the Mako shoulder, and we have this product that we call CoPilot, which is a very exciting product that's going to be used by spine surgeons as well as neurosurgeons, which is within the same ecosystem as Mako and our Q navigation system. So those are the ones I'd point out to, but what I'd tell you is every business has launches planned. And as some of them accumulate a number of small launches, then you end up driving pretty terrific growth. But I would say maybe we're kind of midway through the large platforms. But I would tell you, everyone is reloading. So we launched 1788, and they're reloading and already working on 1888. So I think we've just hit a sort of a cadence of innovation that's as good as it's ever been in my time at Stryker. And so I don't expect that we're going to sort of come off this super cycle and suddenly have some kind of a dip. We're just reloading and reloading, and getting back on M&A offense also will help to continue to fuel that. So I'm very, very bullish really for the next couple of years that this innovation pipeline across our company will continue to fuel high-end growth for Stryker. And second part, Jason?"", 'Jason Beach', ""Joanne, it's Jason. Happy to follow up after the call as well. But AAOS will be exciting. Some of the products that Kevin just referred to, we will be demoing at AAOS. Starting with Blueprint, followed by Pangea, 1788 camera will also be demoed as well. So it will be action-packed, so we plan on seeing you out there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.', 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Congrats on a really strong print here. I had 2 questions. Maybe first one on the guidance here. 7.5% to 9% for the fiscal '24, what is being assumed for China VBP? Any backlog contribution? And I'm looking at Q1, that's the toughest comp of the year. Should Q1 still be within that annual guidance range of 7.5% to 9%?"", 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""Vijay, yes, as we look at -- I don't want to guide quarterly, but I would tell you that the cadence of what we're going to deliver from the midpoint will play out similar to 2023. But keep in mind, you got to back out 1 selling day in Q1 is what I would say. And then on VBP, I'll let Jason..."", 'Jason Beach', ""Yes, I mean -- it's Jason. On VBP, I think we don't disclose in terms of the impact there, so we won't. But in terms of a follow-up to your capital question, as we think about the capital environment, really the tone has not changed there. We feel really good. Orders are very healthy. I mentioned that we came into the year with an elevated level, so we feel good. And just as a reminder, right, if you think about our capital sales, so our smaller capital being, call it, 15% of our sales needs to continue to be refreshed as you think about kind of the procedural volume. And then large capital being 10% of our sales, again, very healthy from both a order and backlog perspective. So we feel good about that in 2024."", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Understood. And Kevin, maybe one for you on that. I saw that you mentioned direct-to-consumer campaign on Mako is very successful. Could you just elaborate on that? And I'm curious, do you think like on the Spine side, we could perhaps see adoption rates similar to Knee, where 50%, 60% of spine procedures could be done in Mako at some point in the future?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Well, first, the direct-to-consumer has been terrific. I mean obviously, we have such a lead in robotic-assisted surgery. We want to make sure that we're differentiating our product among the rest of products, and the searches and the impressions that we have kind of exceeded our expectations. So we're really pleased, we're going to continue that program for a good portion of this year. And so that certainly helped create a tremendous interest among consumers as well as hospitals, who actually watch the same ads as consumers, so we're very excited about that.Spine, we couldn't be more happy because certainly, that's been a gap in our portfolio relative to others. And this has got terrific workflow. And look, I think robotic adoption tends to really grow no matter what procedure you're doing. If you have a good solution, it will, over time, become the majority and eventually standard of care. And we've obviously seen this in the general surgery world, as it relates to prostate, and starting to happen in other cases. And I think it's going to happen in orthopaedics. And so Spine might take a little longer, but I absolutely do believe it's going to be key for us in the future. We're extremely excited. We've been showing surgeons the Mako spine, getting terrific feedback on the workflow and the speed and the efficiency. And again, that's within the same ecosystem as the Q Guidance. So we've been selling a lot of Q Guidance software, which is used to navigate those procedures. And that same camera, which is the fastest camera in the market, will be compatible with Mako when we launch it. So I do believe it will become, for pedicles replacement at least, the vast majority of the procedures in the future."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Shagun Singh with RBC.', 'Shagun Singh Chadha', ""Kevin, I was hoping to get your thoughts on utilization. It's been a key topic this last week across some health care sectors. What trends are you seeing in health care utilization across different care settings? What is driving it? And how do you think about the sustainability of it? Is it being driven by the aging demographics? Is it innovation? Is it just low market penetration? And I think you did indicate that there is still a backlog and it is contributing. But is it a meaningful contributor to growth on a year-over-year basis? And then I have a follow-up."", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Okay. Well, I think if you look at the hospitals and what they're saying, that's kind of one of the indicators we look at, they're busy, right? The hospitals are busy. Patients are -- definitely, aging demographics plays for Stryker's portfolio. That definitely plays to our advantage. And every day, 10,000 more people are turning 65. The activity levels are also increasing, right? The advent of pickle ball has been a terrific thing for our business. More active people who are elderly tend to want to stay active, and activity levels are kind of the biggest predictor of needing joint replacements and Sports Medicine procedures. And so we're seeing very good activity levels. And so I don't really want to talk about backlog. I just think what we're seeing is patients presenting -- frankly, some patients who are just wanting to be more active, losing weight, and then wanting to be more active and then being eligible for surgery. So we do see really good -- a waiting list for surgeries, for surgeons in the orthopaedic space. Hospitals ordering capital, whether it's small capital or large capital, building more ASCs. The ASC trend has actually really helped because patients love it. They go, they get home the same day. They have a terrific experience, and they tell all their friends. And that word of mouth is spreading for hip and knees. Absolutely, for hip-and-knee surgeries, that is happening. And our percent of procedures in ASCs continues to climb. So I think those are -- there's a number of factors I just outlined, all of them pointing to this, at least for this year, continued good demand. And I'm not -- I don't know that it's -- I don't know how temporary it is. This could be continuing, frankly, for a period of time because I think demographics and activity levels are the 2 drivers that we're seeing, at least for our portfolio of businesses."", 'Shagun Singh Chadha', ""That's really helpful. And then just on guidance, you guys delivered a pretty -- or you put up a pretty strong initial guide out of the gates. Does it give you room for upside as you move through the year? And I guess more specifically, what areas could we potentially look to drive that upside?"", 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""Great question. First of all, we have a history that we generally like to follow. And I would tell you that it's early days. We're here in January looking at 2024. We feel very confident about where we're going to perform on sales and driving op margin expansion. At this point, I'm not going to comment on the potential to go beyond that. But we feel very good about the guidance that we put out."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.', 'Philip Chickering', 'Congrats on an amazing year. On the gross margins, can you help bridge the third quarter to fourth quarter gross margins? How much of the impact was mix? And then you have the good guys and bad guys, if you can help us understand that sequential change?', 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', 'Yes. Sure, Pito. Without going into too much detail, I would say the single biggest item was really mix in terms of what was growing much faster in Q4 versus Q3, relative to sort of some of the other items. We also had really solid price performance in Q4, which contributed to that. And then lastly, in sort of in typical Stryker fashion, we hit a little bit of a hockey stick here in Q4 too. And so that actually benefits on the gross margin line.', 'Philip Chickering', ""Okay. Great. And then on pricing, back in third quarter, I think it was about 30 basis points favorable. It's 70 basis points favorable this quarter. Guidance assumes flat pricing for '24. I guess, shouldn't there be some positive pricing in '24 just as the fourth quarter comps out? And after you've gotten accelerating pricing throughout the year, I guess, why is your 2024 pricing flattened out?"", 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""Keep in mind, flat is the average for the whole company. And the way that, that pricing guide is calculated is legacy product over legacy product. So a lot of our pricing increases carry over into 2024. They're just comparing to the new higher price. I would also say too that flat is the average of some up and some down, and so we absolutely will see price increases across some of our businesses. And that will be balanced with some of the challenges we have in, say, spine or some of our other orthopaedic businesses. So I do think we haven't backed off our pricing strategy one bit, and we fully expect to sort of maximize the benefit we're going to get out of pricing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Travis Steed with Bank of America.', 'Travis Lee Steed', ""Glenn, maybe just a finer point on some of the op margin guide. It looks like the 200 basis points, more than half of that is in 2024. Can you just confirm that? There's a little bit of kind of math going around. I just want to make sure we got the math in '24 correct. And then with such a big ramp in '24 on the guidance, just can you give a little more confidence on what you're doing to kind of achieve that 100 basis points plus in 2024 from what you're seeing on the cost input side? Just to kind of drive confidence that that's achievable in '24?"", 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""Yes, I think you can do the math as well as I can, especially given all the areas that I've guided in the full year. So I definitely think you're in the ZIP code for what we think will happen in 2024. And honestly, if we look at sort of what we've laid out and planned for the year, first of all, the natural leverage we get from growth versus fixed cost and operating expenses certainly will provide us some benefit. We also won't stand still in a lot of the gross margin initiatives that I mentioned, and those will move forward and also provide some benefit that we'll see in 2024. And so I would tell you that we haven't walked lightly on this. I would say that across the globe, Stryker is very focused on these op margin expansion projects and sustainable op margin expansion for 2024 and 2025. And so we feel very confident that we'll be able to deliver that."", 'Travis Lee Steed', ""Great. And then maybe one quick question on Mako shoulder just to make sure that's still expected to come in 2024. And anything else you want to say on that at this point?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Yes. Listen, as we've said from the beginning, Mako shoulder will launch at the end of '24. So don't expect to have much at all of a revenue impact. That said, [it's] something like our shoulder business needs, Mako shoulder to be growing at strong double digits. They have terrific products within upper extremities, with Shoulder iD, with a number of really pyrocarbon humeral. We have a fracture stem for Perform, which is incredible, a reverse Perform stemless. So we have 4 terrific launches in upper extremity, so they're going to be fine even before Mako. But Mako will be the end of the year. The feedback from surgeons have been terrific, but that will have much more of an impact in '25, not so much in '24."", 'Operator', ""Our next question will come from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler."", ""Matthew Oliver O'Brien"", ""Just on Mako, this question might be for Jason. Just the domestic number this quarter was a little bit soft, and we're hearing about one of your competitors just giving their system away, so it's not all that great. Can you talk about the dynamics that you're seeing in the market, especially domestically for Mako in terms of placing systems, selling systems, and then just having to get really aggressive on the pricing side, just given the environment that you're in? And then conversely, the OUS number looks phenomenal again. Just where are we at in terms of growing that business over the next several years? And I do have one follow-up."", 'Jason Beach', ""Matt, I'll start this and Kevin, feel free, obviously, to weigh in. But as we think about the Mako offense, and I think we've said this previously as well, when we think about the various options to bring Mako to market, we've been flexible, right, whether it's leasing, rental, et cetera. So I think we're very competitive from that standpoint. And to your comment on kind of where we are, I would still say whether it's U.S. or internationally, early innings here. We've got a lot of runway relative to Mako. But as we think about the financing options, it's not going to be an impediment for us to expand the Mako footprint."", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Yes. The only thing I would add to Jason's comments are that every ASC Mako that's installed is financed. Every one. And that's becoming a bigger percentage of the Mako installations. So what you're seeing is more financed rentals and financed versus outright capital purchases. So that, obviously, the revenue number and the revenue growth of 3% in the U.S. is not installation growth. Installation growth is higher than what you're seeing. And over time, that will start to normalize and then you'll start to see the growth rate to be more reflective of the installation rate. But we're going through this kind of transition phase right now.And we aren't giving them away. So we charge for it. We have different pricing models, obviously. And we want the customers to have skin in the game. So that -- if we just give it away, they have no incentive to use it. And what we don't want are a bunch of robots collecting dust. So we care a lot and we monitor utilization of the robots very, very significantly. And then, of course, OUS, we're seeing terrific pickup and a lot more purchases than finance. We do offer financing around the world. But so far, in international, we're seeing a lot more purchases than we are financing, which is why you see the revenue spike. But again, international has a huge potential. It's kind of where we were in the U.S. about 5 years ago."", ""Matthew Oliver O'Brien"", ""Understood. And then sticking with Mako. Kevin, you mentioned shoulder. You don't really need the application as much because you're crushing it on the shoulder side. In spine, you're doing better in the last couple of quarters. I haven't really heard why that is. I don't know if it's just on the dislocation or not. But I think it's probably a bigger opportunity on the spine side of the business going forward. These centers that already have Mako and use them for hips and knees, can you quickly transfer the system to the spine part of those institutions or facilities and start to pick up share fairly quickly? Or is this something that's going to take many, many quarters? We're talking '25, '26 before it really starts to impact the Spine business?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""What I'd say is, first of all, the Mako brand is extremely well known. That's a very, very big positive. And I think what you're going to see is a much faster uptake than you would have seen had we not had already had Mako on hips and knees. Will it take a little bit of time? Sure. Well, let's find a surgeon who want to share the robot with hips-and-knees surgeons. Not sure yet. Obviously, that's something we're going to see play out, whether they're going to want their own robot or they're going to be willing to operate on the days that hip-and-knee people aren't operating. So that's a whole dynamic, I think, that will vary account by account. So we're already working on our commercialization plans. I think part of the reason for our success is success of the Q Guidance, which is 1/2 of the system. So you have the Q Guidance and as well Mako, they know it's coming now. Customers have gone to Leesburg, Virginia, our spine headquarters, to see Mako spine. And many of them have stopped their purchases of other robots, knowing that this is coming. So I think that's what's helping to contribute to our, let's call it, somewhat improved performance. But we still would like to grow at a higher rate than we are right now. And we know we need not just Mako but also the CoPilot product, so we're going to go from being behind to being ahead. And CoPilot should launch in a similar time frame, slightly ahead of Mako spine, so you're now going to have the CoPilot product plus the Mako spine, where our subpar competitors will just have their robot. The ones that have robot will just have a robot, without CoPilot with haptic feedback that can do the laminectomy and discectomy portions of the procedure, which complements the pedicle screw placement. So we're really going to be in a great position by the time third quarter comes around. Robots do take time, so the scaling will take time. But I think it will be certainly much faster than the initial people who came in with robotics. And they know they benefit from it, and they know they can trust the Mako brand."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.', 'Joshua Thomas Jennings', ""I wanted to, hopefully, Kevin, ask about just get a temperature check on the health care delivery systems capacity for orthopaedic procedure growth. I think heading into '23 after experiencing 2022, there were concerns around staffing shortages, et cetera, and potentially creating a bottleneck for procedure volume growth. That clearly didn't play out in 2023. It doesn't sound like from your comments, it's going to play out. You expect it to play out in 2024. But are there any capacity constraint issues in the U.S. health care delivery system for orthopaedic procedure volume growth as we go forward in '24 and '25? Or is that fully in the rearview mirror?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Yes, I think it's largely in the rearview mirror. There's still niggling things here and there, but it's gotten very quiet. You saw that in Q4. It's just a boomer of a Q4. And the kind of the normal seasonality, I think we now have finally a normalized year for you to compare against, of course, adjusted for selling days. But there is a normalized year finally. And yes, they've gotten their staffing issues solved largely, and they do prioritize orthopaedics because orthopaedics is a money maker for hospitals, right? Cardiovascular and orthopaedic procedures are the 2 money makers.And so if they are short staffed, they are going to prioritize staffing for orthopaedics. I would say the only area that still has a lot of room to run is ASCs. So every hospital is constructing ASCs, and that's going to continue to be an engine of future growth. But I'd say we're in a very normalized environment. They have the capacity. They can operate additional days, which we saw some of that in Q4 again, which we hadn't seen for a couple of years. So I think the hospitals are absolutely ready now, and a lot of that is behind us."", 'Joshua Thomas Jennings', ""Excellent. Just one follow-up on Mako. Just another record system placement quarter. Was hoping to just get some details on where -- what you're seeing in terms of second or even third system purchases by hospitals, hospital systems. Any kind of percentage of total systems? Or how big of an opportunity do you see kind of getting that second, third, maybe even fourth system into hospitals?"", 'Jason Beach', ""Josh, it's Jason. First, I would say there are many hospital systems across the U.S. that are second, third system. For competitive reasons, we don't disclose kind of number of units installed. But you certainly see numerous systems with multiple Makos. I think as you fast forward to a shoulder and spine application, you're going to see more and more of that when you think about utilization and the need for future systems. So that's kind of how we think about that."", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Yes. Frankly, I would say it's rare to have one Mako in a hospital now. There are some that have 5, 6, 7 Makos. I think 60% of our knees are going to Mako. That's got to be a lot of Makos to be able to drive that kind of volume. So the days of people saying, well, this is my first Mako, those days in the U.S. are kind of fading. That phenomenon still exists outside the U.S."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Chris Pasquale with Nephron.', 'Christopher Thomas Pasquale', 'Just quickly on the SERF acquisition. Are there any particular portfolio gaps you closed with that deal? Or is it more about expanding your distribution footprint internationally?', 'Jason Beach', ""Chris, it's Jason. And we'll talk about this more after the close. But it really is -- it helps from a hip portfolio perspective. But beyond that, we haven't said much at this point. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we're set to close this quarter, and then we'll certainly talk more to that."", 'Christopher Thomas Pasquale', ""And then I'm curious how you're thinking about the outlook for Neurovascular in '24. '23 was a better year for that segment in the U.S., but it kind of got offset by international. And along with Spine, it was really one of only 2 segments not to grow high single digits or better. So what's the game plan to drive better growth in that business? And do you have what you need internally? Or do you need to look for supplements to that?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Look, we continue to like the neurovascular market, as there's still a large number of patients that aren't being treated. It's an attractive market growing high single digits. And we do expect to grow in line, at least in line with the market. We are obviously very hard hit by China this year with the VBP. We had a very big neurovascular business in China, so that hurt. I don't know that we completely lapped it, but it's going to -- we're going to get to the bottom of China pretty soon, and then that will be behind us. We also have the SERF acquisition, which is off to a very good start outside the United States. We are seeking U.S. approval. I believe that will be some time in 2025, maybe beginning of '26. So we still have a bit of time to wait for that, but that is a fabulous product for intrasaccular technology. We are looking at an area like liquid embolics. We don't have that product, if you want to think about one that we are going to be looking into. Every business has something they'd like to add. But we do have a good pipeline. We don't talk about Neurovascular pipeline too much because they get subject to regulatory approval through a PMA process. So -- but the team does have some very good products that are lining up. And I do believe we're going to be back to kind of much closer market growth, slightly above market growth in the years ahead. But as the market continue to [like], it obviously has gotten much more competitive on the ischemic side, and we continue to have a very strong business on the hemorrhagic side. We launched a couple of products last year, the Vecta 46 catheter, the Tetra coil, and that kind of fueled some very good U.S. growth as you saw in the back half of the year. So we like the business. Yes, it's not as fast growing as it was historically, but it's still a very good business. We're committed to it and do expect that, that will pick up as we put VBP in the rearview mirror."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.', 'Danielle Joy Antalffy', ""I'll echo everyone's congrats on a really strong end to the year and strong start to 2024. Just a quick question on the orthopaedics market in general. One of the things I've been trying to get a handle on is what's really happening in underlying market growth. Obviously, 2023 benefited from some semblance of a backlog work-down. But it seems like yourselves and your competitors -- not that you gave guidance specifically for ortho, but seemed to be signaling higher than sort of normal, call it, pre-COVID market growth. And I'm curious, beyond pricing, what's really changed here? Has capacity increased? We talked about ASCs. What's changed fundamentally in the orthopaedic -- large-joint orthopaedics market that might be driving higher -- sustainably higher growth versus pre-COVID levels?"", 'Jason Beach', ""Danielle, it's Jason. I think a couple of things, right? And Kevin even alluded to this, I think, earlier as well. But I think there's a variety of things around demographics. Kevin touched on activity levels. Certainly, that plays a part here. We talked about a more favorable pricing environment. Certainly, it plays a role. And then if you think just from an adoption standpoint with robotic-assisted surgery, I think there's a variety of dynamics at play here that have come into play in terms of elevated market levels. And if you saw what we published coming out of Investor Day, we've said over the next 2 to 3 years, we expect this to be in kind of that mid-single-digit range. So we're certainly confident in 2024 and beyond as we think about the ortho markets."", 'Danielle Joy Antalffy', ""And I guess just a follow-up on that. How much of that is Stryker-specific though? Because given the innovation on Stryker's side, the success of Mako and pull-through there, how much is market broadly versus Stryker-specific, if you can even remotely quantify that?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Danielle, look, we've always talked about outgrowing the market. Let's call it, round numbers, 300 basis points ahead of the market. And in the past, there was a time when hips weren't quite growing that fast until we launched [it]. But if you go back over the last decade, we have been growing roughly 300 basis points faster than market. So if the market moves up, then our numbers move up as well. And I think you've seen that all year this year, as you've seen in the last couple of years. So that's kind of the way I'd look at it is whatever the market grows, we should be roughly 300 basis points faster because we have this huge lead in robotic-assisted surgery as well as cementless. And we just have a team that's firing on all cylinders."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Matt Miksic with Barclays.', 'Matthew Stephan Miksic', ""So maybe a couple of follow-ups on some of the things that have come up, and I'd love to try to get some additional color on M&A. You talked about sort of being back on offense, which is awesome. And just maybe if you could talk a little bit about what that means, large versus small, sort of new platform versus maybe something that strengthens one of your existing businesses like, I don't know, Neurotech or ENT or Neuromod has come up in the past. Anything to add, you can talk about that. That would be great. And then I have one follow-up."", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Matt, look, I can't get too specific. You know the nature of M&A. M&A is fluid, and the deals have to make sense financially after the buyer that's ready to sell when you want to acquire. I think because of the pent-up demand in the businesses, we have a lot of mouths to feed and they're hungry. And so I would think in the, let's say, at least the first half of the year, there'll probably be more of tucking things in that -- because we've been staying close to these companies, and we have a bunch of deals that are teed up. But then once you get through the first half of the year, I think it becomes open field. And then open field means maybe more tuck-ins, but it means maybe more things that are in the adjacency categories. We're always open to those. But a lot of things have to -- stars have to align in order to be able to do those deals. But we're back on the normal Stryker offense. And again, what does that mean? It means most of the deals, by number, are going to be those tuck-in deals. But things like a Vocera and Neurovascular and those types that do Physio-Control, those kinds of deals are going to pop up that are more in the adjacent categories. But I can't predict this, honestly, because I don't know what's going to happen. But we are out hunting, and we are excited to get back to a more regular M&A. It's been a huge part of our offense. We know how to do this. We've gotten really good acumen around valuations and around integrations, which -- early in my tenure, we weren't so good at integrations. And if I look at Wright Medical, it was just like -- it's just been a role model for how to integrate a complex business, and the results have been stunning."", 'Matthew Stephan Miksic', ""That's great. And then just a follow-up on ASCs. This has always been kind of sort of a hot topic, I guess, for the last few years, particularly coming out of the pandemic. So just maybe some thoughts, if you could, on where you are in terms of the build-out of that opportunity? Maybe where -- like the percentage of hips and knees that are now, you think, being done through that channel? And then sort of back to the M&A side of it, is there -- are there other businesses that have some synergy there? You've obviously got [all the] equipment with Mako, with your OR equipment and implant pull-through for these -- to these ASCs. But anything else makes sense to kind of bridge and lever that success you've had there?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Okay. I could spend a long time on this, but I'll just sort of cut to the chase and say that, look, things are continuing to progress in the ASC. We're now running between 12% to 15% of our hips and knees in the ASC. That's higher certainly than it was last year. So it continues to climb at a gradual rate because the great limiting factor is capacity and the build-outs of these ASCs. But it is definitely continuing a steady climb. We have everything we need for orthopaedic ASCs. And when I say everything, I mean booms, lights, power tools, Steri-Shield, Neptune, waste management, operating table, every implant from foot and ankle to shoulder to hips to knees to spine. And I'm going to include spine in that because we just most recently did a really terrific ASC deal in spine, a lot of spine procedures moving to the ASC. We did this in Duluth, Minnesota, which is a really exciting deal, and we were able to leverage spine in addition to a lot of other capital equipment in the ASC. And some of those new builds and big renovations, we are absolutely beautifully positioned. What we're now looking at, now that we're a little bit in the GI space with Neptune and the POM acquisition that we have, is what else can we do in that space and other things we could add in that space. Now it's not -- I'm not saying that specifically about ASC. It's about we are -- we like to be really busy in the call point. And now that we're in the GI call point, with every call point we go into, we say, what else can we bring to that call point? What other value can we bring? I'm not predicting that we'll do something in that space, but that's kind of how we look at it. But as it relates to these orthopaedic ASCs, we are in an incredibly good position to be able to win in the ASC world."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity.', 'Caitlin Cronin', ""Congrats on a great quarter. Just jumping up on Matt's question earlier. Momentum in spine really seems to be strong. Do you have any more clarity on how much you've been able to capitalize on the disruption in the space or expect to kind of capitalize from the disruption?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Yes. I tell you, listen, our performance thus far has really nothing to do with the disruption of the consolidation. I mean it's just starting. We've just started to hear some disruption in Texas as an example and a couple other little spots. So I would say, very early days of disruption, and that's not the reason why we're doing better. We kind of really improved our offense in spine, especially as it relates to enabling tech. I think the Q Guidance was big shot in the arm for the Spine business. They've done a terrific job selling that and then, of course, leveraging that for implants. That's been more of a factor than disruption. I think we're going to see the disruption starting this year. And hopefully, we'll be able to pick up on that. But thus far, there really hasn't been much in the way of disruption. And we're going to see that play out over the course of this year."", 'Caitlin Cronin', ""Got it. And then just a quick one on Mako shoulder. You noted great feedback from docs. What's kind of going to be the use case for the docs? Is it going to be outcomes, time savings, et cetera?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Just -- look, there's a whole series of outcomes. Just to simplify it, it makes a very hard procedure very easy to do. That's the way I would simplify it. Why was the partial knee so widely successful? It was a hard procedure to do, and the robot made it easy. And the shoulder is harder to do than a partial knee, and it's going to make a very hard procedure very easy to do. It takes stress off the surgeon and have very predictable results. That's been the value prop. There are surgeons I talk to now that, due to high volume of knees, that tell me at the end of the day, I'm not tired anymore. This robot is taking away my stress. It's just making life easier for me, and you can multiply that by 10 for shoulder replacements."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer.', 'Steven Michael Lichtman', ""First on price, how are you thinking about the relative pricing outlook in '24 as you look at the major segments of MedSurg Neuro versus Ortho Spine? Anything meaningfully different than what we saw in '23 directionally? And I know we touched on this at Investor Day, but what gives you the confidence in the sustainability of this firmer pricing environment? And then I have a quick follow-up."", 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""It's Glenn. So as we look at price, first of all, we've really honed in a strategy and a group that solely focuses on pricing for the whole company. If we think about sort of those segments, I don't think you'll see a lot of different performance in what we see out of our segments in general. MedSurg and Neurotech has more of an ability to gain pricing, and we see price increases in those businesses. And honestly, even before the pandemic, we would see price increases coming out of the MedSurg businesses.I would say on the Ortho side, the trend has really been that it's just been less negative. Also, if you think about those ortho contracts, they're generally 3-year contracts. So we haven't really even cycled through all those contracts yet. We have real discussions around inflation in our business with our customers. They know it, they experience it themselves. And so we're just -- I'm not expecting to see positives come out of the Ortho side, but we'll probably continue to see less negative."", 'Steven Michael Lichtman', ""Got it. And then Glenn, just on PILLAR II, is there an impact in '24 that you're offsetting? And how are you thinking about sort of the potential impact in 2025 based on what you know today?"", 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""Good question. As we think about 2024, there is an impact for us. I think that through our tax planning and other strategies, we feel like we have fully offset that impact, and that's included in our effective tax rate guidance. For 2025, it's just -- it's too early to comment at this point, to be honest. It's something we're just starting to look at, and we'll have more on that probably a year from now."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Mike Matson with Needham & Company Inc.', 'Michael Stephen Matson', ""It sounds like you're looking at doing some more M&A here. I was just curious if you could remind us where your leverage ratio is. And if you have a target, just how high you'd be willing to go there?"", 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""We generally try to maintain a leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3. And I think if you do the calc on 2023, where we're sitting at year-end, we're squarely on the lower end of that range. So we do feel like there is some room, if needed, depending on sort of what we see in the acquisition landscape. But I fully expect that sort of given the normal cadence of acquisitions and that product tuck-ins are generally what we sort of normally go after, we likely won't be out borrowing to do those types of acquisitions."", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Yes. And keep in mind that 3 is not necessarily an upper limit, right? So that's a normal landing zone for us, this 2.5 to 3. For the right deal at the right price, could we go higher than 3? Sure, we would. And we have -- obviously have to commit to paying down the debt. But we don't really look at us as sort of being constrained that way. So for the right asset, if it's going to be value-creating for Stryker, we are not afraid to push beyond the 3. But that's kind of the land we like to live in as a landing zone."", 'Michael Stephen Matson', ""Yes, I understand. And then just wanted to ask one about Sports Medicine. I didn't really hear much there. Do you feel like that business is kind of where you want it in terms of the product offering and the scale?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""I am so glad you asked about sports. It's absolutely a rocket ship of growth for us for the past 5, 6, 7 years. They have a number of shoulder launches coming out this year, I believe, 4 different shoulder launches. They call it internally, the shoulder [speech], which is quite motivating. But we've done a terrific job with hip. We've had a terrific job with knee, but shoulder has been kind of the area that we've needed to have new products. But they've been just an amazing business. It was a start-up 12 years ago, and it just become a big, fast-growing business. It's really helped us win ASC deals. Frankly, having a really -- every ASC deal -- orthopaedic ASC deal involves sports. And because we have such a strong portfolio, we are able to win those deals. But historically, we wouldn't have been able to. And it's an incredibly exciting year of new product launches, particularly in shoulder. And I think some of those hopefully might be shown in AAOS. I'll have to get back to you on that. But I'm very bullish. We have a fabulous leader who's been leading the Sports Medicine business since the start-up when we had just a camera and not really much in the way of implants. And we are now formidable in sport medicine. Certainly in the U.S., certainly in Europe, we still have work to do in the emerging markets in Asia Pacific, but really a fabulous business. And it's been part of the growth engine within Endoscopy. And you've seen Endoscopy post pretty impressive results, certainly last year and this year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley.', 'Andrew Christopher Ranieri', ""I'll put both of mine together. But Kevin, you were so early on in the orthopaedic robotics landscape just with soft tissue robotics. What are your kind of current thoughts on supporting that ecosystem today versus entering soft tissue robotics? Is it something that's concerning you? Or just how are you thinking about that opportunity? And then second, just -- could you talk about the PROstep launch from earlier in the fourth quarter or late third quarter? Just any metrics you can kind of share there on the foot business."", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Yes, sure. So as it relates to soft tissue robotics, listen, it's a very interesting space. As you know, there's a very large and very successful company that kind of dominates the space. We certainly don't have a problem selling endoscopy if you look at our numbers. Certainly, for our 1788 and our cameras, we're doing extremely well. We still have huge room for growth outside of being in soft tissue robotics. It's an area that we're certainly interested in, but very respectful of the large incumbent. And I'm not sure that we'd want to try to take them head on. Just like anybody trying to come and take us head on in our space, wouldn't be so easy. But it is an area that we like. There are loads and loads of companies, start-ups in the space, and we're looking at them. And it's not inconceivable that we would make a move at some point. But again, not expecting to come out and launch something that would go head-to-head with the Goliath and try to take them down. So -- but it is a space we're pursuing. We're interested. We're looking at companies, and it's not impossible that we would make a move at some point in the future. It's just not an easy space. As you know, robots are hard. And we're going to be very thoughtful and very careful. But we don't see this kind of -- at this point anyways, as a major threat to our Endoscopy business at all."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Matt Taylor with Jefferies.', 'Matthew Charles Taylor', 'I wanted to ask one about the sprint of margins here and ask you, if you do produce some upside on the top line and the margins over the course of this year and next year, how do you think about delivering that to the bottom line versus reinvesting it above that goal to get back to your pre-COVID margins?', 'Glenn S. Boehnlein', ""I mean, first of all, it's heavily dependent on sort of the mix that we get if we over-deliver on sales in terms of how much margin we can get to. I would say that 200 basis points expansion is the absolute goal, and that will be the target. And if we get there a little sooner, so be it. But we won't take our eye off of making sure that we're doing what's right in the business so that we can deliver that 200 basis points."", 'Matthew Charles Taylor', ""And that -- I wanted to ask another one on Vocera. You talked a lot about it on this call, and it's obviously doing well. Can you talk a little bit about how that's expanding its tentacles kind of throughout your organization? And anything else we should expect from it in the future as it connects some of the different technologies and provide you some cross-selling opportunities?"", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Yes. Great. Listen, I -- integrations are challenging. In this one, we had some challenges with the cloud. We had to restructure the sales force. We are already seeing terrific integration with both beds and now more recently with our wireless stretcher. We had a list before we bought the company, and we've expanded that list of connecting products. And those products that we're going to connect to the ecosystem are not just Stryker products, so there are third-party companies that are coming to us and asking to be connected to our ecosystem. So we want to be a vital resource within hospitals. We're even looking at emergency departments that don't have really well-automated workflow that actually do the documentation that take cognitive load off of nurses. So the potential every day, it just keeps expanding and expanding, and so it's wildly exciting. And the team now -- the new sales team is really starting to hum. Our order growth is starting to really, really pick up in a big way. And so we're super excited. We're not ready to talk about which products we'll be integrating. We'd rather do the integration and tell you about it. And we'd like to sort of give you a full year update. So a year from now, expect we'll give you kind of a wholesome update and include more of those products that will be attached to the ecosystem. But we are really, really excited about this acquisition, and it's a platform. So I'd say after Mako, this is the second platform acquisition that I've done during my tenure. The other deals we've done, none of them have been platforms. And that means it has wild upside potential over time. Now it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take time. But this is -- for us, it's -- it will be very sticky in hospitals. It will just be a renewal, a recurring revenue. And then as you add more and more to the ecosystem, it becomes something that hospitals can't live without. So that's our dream, and we're pretty optimistic given where we are right now, given the momentum that we have, given the interest that we have, both from parts of Stryker as well as third-party companies wanting to integrate to the system."", 'Operator', 'Our final question will come from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.', 'Richard Samuel Newitter', ""I'll just ask one here. And by the way, congrats again on a fantastic quarter. Solid end to the year. So just -- clearly, you guys -- since your Analyst Day, in particular, you've been conveying how committed you are to margin expansion. You're kind of putting a stake in the ground, really strong guidance here for '24. I guess I'm just going to ask, how should we think about that margin guidance relative to the potential and willingness to take on margin dilution as you get more aggressive on the M&A front? Should we think of that as something that already had contemplated the potential -- the need to absorb some dilution? Is there -- are you more focused on top line accretion and more sensitive to kind of margin accretion faster than historically? I would just love your thoughts there on how we should think about kind of this margin trajectory and sprinting back to pre-COVID with respect to deals and how that will fit in the P&L."", 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Thanks, Rich. Thanks for the question. Look, think back to '17, '18, '19. We were expanding margins before some dilution. We have around 80 basis points. And we were not growing at this kind of growth rate, right? We were growing in the 6s and 7s organically, not double-digit growth organically or high single-digit growth organically. So with that higher growth, this is not a crazy level of margin expansion that we think we could do. But doing small deals and if they're small tuck-in varieties, there's some dilution that will come with that. We expect we're going to eat that and be able to deliver the 200 basis points. If a deal came along, let's say, something like a Mako, which as you know occurs once a decade maybe, it's not an everyday occurrence, that had dilution but we felt was just so great for the company that we had to do it, we would go ahead and do it. And then we would look at our numbers and say, is this something we can absorb? Or isn't it? Our going-in assumption is that that's not a likely occurrence. It's not impossible though. And I never want to rule anything out when it comes to M&A. If something really delicious appears and we think that this is going to be great for our future, we're going to go ahead and do it. And then we'll do our math and figure out, can we get there with the 200 basis points? But in the normal cadence of operations of Stryker, and that means doing a number of deals that have a little bit of dilution here or there, we're going to eat it and we'll deliver our 200 basis points. If something bigger happens like a Mako that, as you know, was very dilutive but has proven to be a pretty terrific asset for our company, we're not going to say, well, we're going to wait 2 years and then we'll do it later. We're going to go ahead and do it. But again, I don't see that on the horizon. It's not obvious to me. But I'd never want to rule that out. It would be foolish, frankly, to be beholden to a certain financial target and pass up what could be very value creating for our company. But again, it's not our current frame of mind, not our current thought process. But I don't want to rule out that, that could be a possibility."", 'Operator', 'I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.', 'Kevin A. Lobo', ""Thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, we have terrific momentum as we finish the year. We're excited about 2024, and we look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you.""]"

The S&P 500 enjoys a bull market and has touched record highs after spinning in a tight trading range for quite some time.', 'The broader index gained more than 3% in January, as solid economic growth crushed recession fearmongering while inflationary pressure cooled down to levels that encouraged the Federal Reserve to take a dovish stance.', 'The uptick in consumer outlays and strength in the labor market helped the U.S. economy expand at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which followed an annual growth of 4.9% in the third quarter, per the Commerce Department. Strong back-to-back readings came in despite the Fed’s monetary tightening measures.', 'In reality, consumer spending increased by 2.8% in the final quarter of 2023, while business investments and government spending also improved. On the other hand, jobs are being added to the economy at a steady clip and the jobless rate remains low.', 'Needless to say, economic slowdown fears are now on the back burner, with most of the respondents surveyed by the National Association of Business Economics agreeing that there is a 50% or less chance of the U.S. economy heading into a recession in the upcoming one-year span as prices pressures have eased and supply-chain issues have ebbed.', 'Talking about inflation, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index, increased only 1.7% in the fourth quarter, less than the 2.6% increase in the third quarter, and very much around the Fed’s target of 2%. With price pressures falling, the Fed is expected to trim interest rates this year, which boosts consumer spending and business investments.', ""Thus, with things looking up for the economy, the stock market is poised to gain for the rest of the year. Historically, the rest of the year’s performance is dependent on how stocks performed in January, better known as the “January barometer.” If the S&P 500 finishes in the green in January, then it's expected to post positive results for the remainder of the year."", 'Moreover, Bespoke Investment Group stated that when the S&P 500 gained more than 2% in January, its median performance for the remaining year was an increase of 13.5%.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Vulcan Materials'  ROE."", 'Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vulcan Materials is:', '11% = US$838m ÷ US$7.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To begin with, Vulcan Materials seems to have a respectable ROE. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 14%, we aren't very excited. Additionally, the low net income growth of 3.5% seen by Vulcan Materials over the past five years doesn't paint a very bright picture. Not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. Hence there might be some other aspects that are keeping growth in earnings low. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is facing competitive pressures."", ""We then compared Vulcan Materials' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Vulcan Materials is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry."", ""While Vulcan Materials has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 30% (or a retention ratio of 70%), it has seen very little growth in earnings. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating."", ""Additionally, Vulcan Materials has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 20% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Vulcan Materials' payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 14%, over the same period."", 'Overall, we feel that Vulcan Materials certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a moderate ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -44.4%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $1.46 billion, down 13.5% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for First American Financial?', 'For First American Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.', 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that First American Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that First American Financial would post earnings of $1.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.22, delivering a surprise of +11.93%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""First American Financial doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', 'Cincinnati Financial (CINF), another stock in the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.85 for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +45.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.29 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Cincinnati Financial has been revised 0.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.70%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.', 'This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cincinnati Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

The stock is up almost 64% over the last year as the company readies itself for a breakup that will see GE disappear as GE Aerospace and GE Vernova (a combination of GE Power and GE Renewable Energy) appear. Investors holding the stock will get a piece of both companies, but is it time to take profits, or does it make sense to keep holding the stock?"", ""The spinoff and the nature of the aerospace industry make it a bit difficult to get a handle on GE Aerospace's prospects and financials. The following table combines the guidance on the recent earnings call with the 2025 guidance on the investor day in March."", ""As you can see, there are some asterisks, but they shouldn't be ignored as trivialities."", 'Firstly, the 2024 operating profit guidance is $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Still, since this includes $600 million of corporate and stand-alone costs due to the spinoff, I\'ve used the ""current reporting"" guidance for ease of comparison to show the bridge to the 2025 guidance. The same logic applies to the 2025 guidance, where management assumes $500 million in stand-alone costs, making the actual profit guidance $7.1 billion to $7.6 billion.', 'Furthermore, the 2024 profit margin guidance is my estimate using the midpoint of the ""current reporting"" guidance and assuming that 12.5% equates to low double digits.', 'GE Aerospace', '2022', '2023', '2024 Est.', '2025 Est.', 'Revenue', '$26.1 billion', '$31.8 billion', 'low double-digit growth', 'Low double-digits to mid-teens growth', 'Operating Profit', '$4.8 billion', '$6.1 billion', '$6.6 billion to $7.1 billion*', '$7.6 billion to $8 billion*', 'Profit Margin', '18.3%', '19.2%', '~19.2%**', '20%', ""Data source: GE presentations and author's analysis. *GE guidance excluding stand-alone costs. **Author's estimate using 12.5% revenue growth and the midpoint of segment profit guidance."", ""Of course, the next question is why GE Aerospace's margins will possibly be flat in 2024 and then bounce in 2025. It's especially relevant as GE's rival engine maker, RTX's Pratt & Whitney, sees margin expansion in 2024 -- a point noted by Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu on the RTX earnings call."", 'GE and GE Aerospace may be conservative with their guidance. Culp has a good track record of exceeding guidance, not least in 2023, where initial guidance for $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion was easily trumped by the $6.1 billion noted in the table above.', 'One answer to the question comes from the nature of the airplane engine industry, whereby engines are sold at a loss only to generate decades of highly profitable aftermarket and service revenue. Indeed, GE and GE Aerospace CFO Rahul Ghai noted that the ramp in the LEAP engine (used on the Airbus A320 neo family and the sole engine on the Boeing 737 MAX) production ramp would negatively impact margins. In addition, ""even though LEAP services becomes profitable in \'24, it\'s still a margin headwind,"" and then there\'s the GE9X engine (used on the Boeing 777X) ramp in 2025 as well.', 'Turning briefly to GE Vernova, the business managed to eke out a small profit in 2023, and management expects further improvement in 2024 with profitability at GE Power, onshore wind, and digital, offsetting losses at offshore (all GE Renewable Energy business), ultimately resulting in $0.7 billion to $1.1 billion in free cash flow (FCF).', 'I\'ve discussed the game plan at GE Vernova in a previous article, and GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik noted it had reduced the offshore equipment backlog to $4 billion and said, ""The industry is beginning to reset, and while it does, we\'ll be highly selective on adding to the backlog.""', 'Conservatively combining the 2024 FCF guidance at both industrial businesses of "">$5 billion"" at GE Aerospace and $0.7 billion to $1.1 billion for GE Vernova would put GE on a forward multiple of around 24 times FCF. That might appear rich, but it includes stand-alone costs for the breakup, and both businesses are set for long-term growth.', ""GE Aerospace is set for multidecade services/aftermarket revenue from LEAP and existing engines. GE Vernova's margins should improve as it works through an unfavorable backlog offshore and improves the business's margin profile."", ""It's still an attractive stock for investors but is not far from fair value now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in General Electric right now?', 'Before you buy stock in General Electric, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and General Electric wasn't one of them.

"", ""Even though their yields may not be terribly high, three dividend stocks that can make for excellent long-term dividend plays are UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), Visa (NYSE: V), and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST). Here's a closer look at their dividend streaks and why their payouts could continue rising for years to come."", 'Health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group increased its dividend in 2023 for the 14th straight year. What was notable about its dividend increase was the size: 14%. While many dividend stocks make modest increases to their payouts, UnitedHealth has been aggressive with its rate hikes. The current quarterly dividend of $1.88 is more than double the $0.90 it was paying its shareholders just five years ago.', ""UnitedHealth's dividend yield of 1.5% is in line with the S&P 500 average but it would be much higher if not for the stock's impressive gains; in 10 years, UnitedHealth shares have risen by more than 600%."", 'The company recently wrapped up another strong year; 2023 revenue rose 15% year over year to $371.6 billion. Operating cash flow was also a monstrous $29.1 billion, nearly $3 billion higher than what the company brought in a year earlier.', ""UnitedHealth's strong industry position coupled with a rising senior population in the U.S. ensures there is plenty more growth on the horizon for the company, which bodes well for dividend investors as well, as that is likely to result in better earnings numbers and higher dividend payments."", ""Credit card giant Visa is a low-yielding stock with a payout of only 0.8%. But what's promising about the stock as a potential income investment is the stability it offers. Credit cards are in use regardless of economic cycles. In challenging conditions, people may use them heavily to make ends meet. In good times, consumers may still be using credit cards to collect points and benefit from the varied perks that they offer."", 'Visa just reported numbers for the first quarter of its fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), and net revenue rose 9% year-over-year to $8.6 billion. Net income jumped an even higher 17% to $4.9 billion. The business looks to be in fine shape, even amid inflation and as consumers tighten up their spending. ', ""As the economy grows, credit card spending is likely to pick up on Visa's network. Being a leader in the industry, the company is in an excellent position to get even larger and more valuable in the years ahead."", ""The stock's 10-year returns are around 400% and the company has been raising its dividend since 2009. With a modest payout ratio of just 22%, this makes for an excellent dividend growth stock to buy and hold for years."", ""Big-box retailer Costco has been increasing its dividend for nearly two decades. Although its yield looks underwhelming at 0.6%, that doesn't tell the whole story. A big reason the yield isn't higher is, like the other stocks on this list, it has been such a phenomenal investment; over the past decade, the stock is up 500%."", ""Those are some mouthwatering returns, which more than make up for a low dividend yield. And Costco has also paid special dividends multiple times over the years. It recently paid a special dividend of $15 per share -- that's more than 3 times its annual dividend of $4.08."", ""Costco has generated more than $6.5 billion in profit over the trailing 12 months on revenue of $245.7 billion. Although those make for a fairly lean (2.7%) margin, this business has proven it knows what it's doing, carefully calculating which markets to go into and which products to sell.

My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead."", 'Danyal Hussain', ""Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria."", 'Maria Black', ""Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. This morning, we reported strong second quarter results, including 6% revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. I'll begin with a review of the quarter's financial highlights before providing an update on the progress we are making across our strategic priorities. We delivered solid Employer Services new business bookings in the second quarter reaching a new record bookings volume for Q2 and keeping us on track for our full year outlook. Growth was especially robust across our small business portfolio, and we also experienced healthy growth in our mid-market and international business. With steady demand in HCM and a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter, we look forward to the important selling season ahead. Employer Services retention was strong in the second quarter. Although it declined slightly compared to the prior year, we once again exceeded our expectations as we continue to benefit from a healthy overall business environment and from our very high client satisfaction levels. Our employer services paid for control growth remained at 2% for the second quarter. The overall labor market remains resilient, and our clients continue to add employees at a moderate pace which is resulting in a very gradual deceleration in pays per control growth. And last, our PEO revenue growth of 3% for the second quarter was in line with our expectations, and we are very pleased to have delivered strong PEO new business bookings that were ahead of our expectations. Based on continued healthy activity levels, we feel good about our PEO bookings momentum, and we look forward to seeing a gradual reacceleration of our PEO business in the second half of this fiscal year. Moving on to a broader update. During the second quarter, we launched a new brand advertising campaign being the next anything. The campaign highlights how the world of work is always changing, sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly and trusted business solutions must evolve with it. The theme aligns with our strategic priorities to give our clients the advantage of our leading technology, expertise and scale. In Q2, we continued to push forward on our first strategic priority to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. A key part of that is the rollout of ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by Gen AI that proactively delivers actionable insights in plain language to enhance HR productivity, aid decision-making and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees. ADP Assist seamlessly integrates with ADP products across multiple platforms. Using an intuitive conversational interface, it provides valuable and contextual insights which touch every aspect of HR. For example, in addition to the features we shared with you last quarter, including our natural language reporting capability, in Q2, we integrated natural language search capabilities into our Run platform, which allows us to understand intent behind the search term and use Gen AI to mine ADP's deep knowledge base to deliver easy-to-use and effective content. ADP Assist also helps clients validate payrolls and solve common employee challenges across HR, payroll, time and benefits. It's a comprehensive experience that is trained on the industry's largest and deepest HCM data set and our deep knowledge base to service highly credible and actionable insights so that clients can make smarter decisions. We are excited about the road map ahead for all of our major solutions, and we expect it to help us build on the recognition we continue to earn in the market. In Q2 alone, we were pleased to be recognized for product leadership by 3 major industry analyst rankings. Everest Group named ADP the highest leader out of 27 providers in its multi-country payroll solutions Peak Matrix report. Nelson Hall identified ADP as a leader in its payroll services vendor evaluation and assessment tool in all markets. And Ventana Research named us an exemplary leader across its North American global and payroll management buyers guide for performing the best and meeting overall product and customer experience requirements.Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions. We shared last quarter that we were beginning to equip our associates with Gen AI capabilities through our agent assist technology. In Q2, we expanded our call summarization deployment to a greater portion of our service associates and started to see productivity gains with shorter handle time and improved service quality. With our global service associates fielding millions of calls annually, we are incredibly excited to test ways to optimize those client interactions. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and we continue to lean into this advantage. In Q2, we announced a strategic collaboration with Convera, a global business-to-business payments company to help our multi-country clients manage the complexity of global payroll and cross-border payments through an integrated platform by combining Convera's payment solutions with our global payroll expertise we're enhancing the client experience by minimizing the need to access various banking platforms and improving payment accuracy, compliance and security. We also announced the launch of ADP Retirement Trust services to support our growing retirement services business. Standing up our own trust services entity demonstrates our scale and commitment to our retirement clients positioning us on par with financial industry leaders and ahead of HCM competitors that rely on third parties. This commitment can really matter to financial advisers, keep data within ADP's trusted ecosystem and provides a cost and price benefit to ADP and our clients over the long term. Our scale also affords us the opportunity to partner with other leading technology providers in innovative ways, and we continue to expand on many of those partnerships to provide our sales implementation and service teams with client-specific insights to quickly address market shifts, drive more personalized interactions and deepen our overall client engagement. Overall, our second quarter represented strong outcomes on the financial front. And with respect to our key strategic priorities, I'd like to thank our associates who continue to deliver exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, particularly now as many of them are in the middle of our most hectic time of year completing year-end work. I'm proud to share that their efforts helped drive our overall Net Promoter Score to its highest level ever in the second quarter. Thank you again for all that you do for ADP and for our clients. And now I'll turn it over to Don."", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong second quarter with our consolidated revenue growth moderating in line with our expectations, and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in slightly better than expected. However, the interest rate backdrop has changed since we last provided our full year outlook, and we are lightly tweaking our outlook, which I will detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis coming in slightly ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, we continue to grow our ES new business bookings resulting in a record second quarter bookings volume. Our small business portfolio and international business provided outsized growth contributions this quarter. And with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track for our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. As mentioned earlier, our ES retention declined slightly in Q2 versus the prior year, but again, exceeded our expectations. Given our first half retention outperformance, we are increasing our full year retention outlook slightly. We now anticipate a 40 to 60 basis point decline in our full year retention, which is 10 basis points better than our prior forecast. ES pays per control growth of 2% in Q2 and was in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our 1% to 2% growth outlook for the full year. And client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectations in Q2 as a slight decline in our average client funds balance, which we discussed last quarter, was more than offset by an increase in our average yield. However, we are revising our full year client funds interest outlook lower to reflect the change in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal '24 client funds interest revenue of $985 million to $995 million, and we expect a net impact from our client funds extended investment strategy of $835 million to $845 million, representing a reduction of about $20 million at the midpoint. In total, there was no change to our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 170 basis points in Q2. driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue growth, but reflecting the impact of a reduced client funds interest revenue forecast as well as a slight increase in expected Gen AI-related spend, we are tweaking our fiscal '24 ES margin outlook and now anticipate the lower end of our prior margin range. Moving on to the PEO, we had 3% revenue growth, driven by 2% growth in average worksite employees in the second quarter. These metrics were in line with our expectation, and we are encouraged to see signs of stabilization in our PEO pays per control growth. As Maria mentioned, our PEO new business bookings were very strong in Q2. With continued healthy activity levels, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp in our worksite employee growth in the back half of fiscal '24. And we are maintaining our full year growth outlook of 2% to 3%. PEO margins decreased 50 basis points in Q2. As we shared last quarter, we assume this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit will be lower than last year's benefit, and we are further narrowing our PEO margin expectation to be down 80 to 100 basis points in fiscal '24 and versus our prior expectation of a decline of 50 to 100 basis points. Putting it all together, there was no change to our fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth outlook of 6% to 7%. With the 2 changes to segment margin, we now expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points versus our prior outlook for an increase of 60 to 80 basis points. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 23%, and we still anticipate fiscal '24 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12% with the middle of that range, the most likely outcome, given current assumptions. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.', 'Mark Steven Marcon', ""Congratulations on all the accolades that you've gotten from the third-party reviewers. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the initiatives. And specifically, one that stood out was setting up your own trust. Can you talk a little bit about the investment there and how we should think about how that would end up unfolding and what do you think some of the reactions would be with some of your third-party partners like you've got bank partnerships and CPA partnerships and obviously, benefit administration partnerships. How do you think they'll end up reacting?"", 'Maria Black', ""Thank you, Mark. I appreciate the question, and I appreciate your well wishes on all of our recognition, certainly excited to see across the board -- the recognition we mentioned during the prepared remarks, but also the continued momentum across all of our initiatives. Happy to comment on Retirement Trust Services. It is really a demonstration of our scale. And so when I think about what it means to our clients, what it means to the ecosystem that you mentioned, banks, CPAs. I think it's all incredibly positive. And trust services are a core component of any 401(k) plan. Given the size and the scale of our retirement services business, what we found is that the pool of what's known as third-party trustees, if you will, that are capable of handling a business just of our size is actually becoming shrinkingly more difficult, if you will, in terms of the number of providers that are able to offer stand-alone trust services to a retirement offering of our size. So in terms of that, we made the decision to launch our in-house trust services. We believe that this is a great value to our clients, to the ecosystem. It puts us on par with other industry leaders in the financial services and really a competitive advantage against some of our HCM competitors that continue to leverage the third-party trustees. So for us, I think it's a big commitment to the business that we have, the retirement business that is, which really can matter to financial advisers. And as we said, CPAs and banks really by taking the trust services and how the implication is that we have better control over our costs. Ultimately, that yields a better price for our clients, a better service. We also have the ability to maintain all of the data inside of ADP's ecosystem which, as you know, is a big component of who ADP is in terms of data integrity and all those things. So that's kind of the retirement trust services in a nutshell Mark."", 'Mark Steven Marcon', ""And then just it was noticeable that you basically are anticipating a lower level of decline in terms of the ES retention, which is coming off of record levels. To what extent is that due to an anticipation of lower levels of bankruptcies as opposed to just the improvement that you've been seeing in terms of your client service scores?"", 'Maria Black', ""So retention is going incredibly well, right? And we mentioned that in the remarks, year-to-date retention has definitely been better than we expected. And so I think things are fundamentally really healthy right now.One thing to keep in mind as I kind of think about the outlook, is that we are, as you mentioned, we are coming off of some of the record highs that we've seen over the last several years. And while we believe that from a specifically a down market perspective, we're close to being normalized back to fiscal '19 trends, we do also anticipate some pressure in the back half from perhaps out of business in bankruptcies having more of a material impact. We haven't seen it to date but we certainly want to ensure that we're cognizant of the fact that we believe it's prudent given that we have retention running at such record levels, we believe it's prudent to plan for it in the back half to have some pressure. And obviously, just like any year, Mark, retention is always noisy, and so we have some normal variability in some services in the back half. Just like you, I'd like to think that there's opportunity there. I think only time will give us the answer to that, but that's kind of how we're thinking about the back half."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.', 'James Eugene Faucette', ""Great. Appreciate all the detail this morning. I wanted to quickly just touch on PEO. You called out a strong acceleration in the business, but it looks like outlook for revenues was changed. You may have mentioned that, but I'm just trying to capture how much of that is timing issue versus the concentration you have in professional services and technology, which still seem a little bit soft, at least in the employment reports."", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes, James. Thanks for that question. We've been happy to see the stabilization in the the pays per control in those sectors, the financial services and technology sectors. So although where there's still a little bit of noise there, it certainly stabilized from what we saw in the prior quarter. So that's positive. I do think that as we looked at our sales results, our bookings for PEO, we were very happy with the bookings. Maria mentioned that already very good. I think as we kind of put that together, the improvement in the pays per control and the improvement in our bookings. I think we're going to be heading towards that reacceleration that we've been pointing to over the last couple of quarters in the PEO but really just trying to get the impact of those 2 components, those variables is really what's going to help us get that reacceleration going."", 'Danyal Hussain', ""James -- just to clarify James, the pays per control, although it's stabilizing, it's not providing any sort of upside versus our prior forecast. So bookings are going well. It takes quite a bit in terms of bookings to really drive a material change to the current year revenue, which you all understand. With pays per control is still providing sequential gradual drag. Those 2 are sort of netting out to an in-line outlook."", 'James Eugene Faucette', ""Got it. Danny. And then quickly on AI. It seems like there's a little bit of incremental investment there and certainly a big focus on this call. But wondering about how we should think about the -- how you're anticipating a return on that investment and over what kind of time frame? And maybe more qualitatively what kinds of paybacks, where there's increased customer satisfaction or internal operations, et cetera?"", 'Maria Black', ""Yes. So I'll start on the AI side and tell you all the reasons again that I'm so excited about it. Maybe Don can give you a little bit about how we're thinking about the return on investments that we're making. So just to remind everyone how we're thinking about AI in its most simplistic way, I think about it really in 3 buckets, the first of which is product and innovation. So putting generative AI into all of our innovation cycle. So that's everything from product development to the features and functionality that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And by the way, later this morning, we're actually issuing a press release that goes through some of our product and innovation, call it philosophy and launches of products, right? So some of what this press release speaks to is how we're thinking about and our design principles around making things easy, smart and human within our product and innovation cycles to really drive things like payroll assist, things like ADP assist into the market in a meaningful way. So product is really kind of the first bucket. And as you'll see, we're making significant investments there. We do have ADP assist now more broadly deployed across the product set, and we're seeing meaningful impact as it relates to our client experience on that. The second bucket is what I call efficiency and service efficiency, and this is really about giving all the same things that we're looking to give our clients to make their jobs easier and more effective and efficient and giving those same tools to our associates. And so we have agent assist. I'm pleased to say that from an agent assist perspective, we've more than doubled the number of associates today that are engaging in AI tools overall. Specifically, a big piece of that is anchored in agent assist and the things we're doing around call summarization. Again, I'll let Don comment on investments and return. But just to kind of give you a flavor of what we're talking about here the feedback we're getting from our associates is there are times we're saving up a minute or 2 minutes by aiding things like call summarization. And while that probably seen minuscule, what I would offer to you is we have thousands of service associates, and we also have millions and millions of calls that we take every single year. And so we're pretty optimistic and excited about a minute here in a minute there and what that means from an incremental opportunity for us over time, right? So we continue to lean into service efficiency and really getting all of our associates more effective as it relates to their ability to engage with our clients. And then last but not least, by the way, I could go on and on and on all day on this topic. But last but not least, very, very important is how we're thinking about generative AI in our go-to-market motions. And so we have, for years, been at the tip of the spear of sales modernization. We have partnerships that are 2 decades old where we've always been leading the way with what it looks like to have a best-in-class modern distribution and sales force, and this is no different for us. We already have a broad set of our sellers leveraging tools along the lines of generative AI, many of which are through our best-in-class vendors and partners that we have and we're seeing great impact there. Things that I used to do myself at a personal level, manually such as pre-call planning, by the way, things like call summarization for prospecting -- these are big items for us as it relates to our go-to-market motions, and we've just started scratching the surface. So all in, really excited, again, just kind of wraps t all up. I think it's about product, service efficiency and our go-to-market motion. We are making active investments. Some of those investments are things that we've shifted that we were already working on in digital transformation. Some of it is incremental investments. And so I think with that, I'll turn it over to Don, if you can kind of talk about how we're thinking about our incremental investments and moreover the return on that."", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes. So I think Maria has just outlined some of the exciting areas that Gen AI will have for us. And some of the things that will change how they will make the client experience better, how they help our associates how they help us sell more, et cetera. But I would say at this point in time, what we're really talking about is some modest investments in Gen AI. I think it's going to be a little while before we start to see returns from those things, but we certainly do anticipate returns. But in the near term right now, it's really a time for investing in these tools, et cetera, and we'll see those outcomes, those financial outcomes somewhere down the road."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.', 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', 'You guys called out higher seller expenses as just one component of the margin headwinds in PEO. I guess the question, is this just the cost to compete in PEO at this point? In other words, is it becoming more expensive to compete in PEO? Or do you expect expense levels related to selling to sort of abate in a more normalized time period?', 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes. I don't think there's -- just to answer the question. There's nothing really unusual or fundamentally different about our selling expenses and how we go to market in the PEO, I think, certainly, as we see higher sales, as you know, we get a lot of our sales -- half of our sales give or take from internal. So some of that's a little bit of our internal housekeeping, if you will, how we allocate expenses between business units, et cetera, but higher sales generally translate into higher selling expenses. So really nothing fundamentally different in how we go to market, certainly not seeing any fundamental differences in the competitive landscape that's driving those expenses."", 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', ""Got it. Okay. And then one follow-up for me. In the context of the international product launches like Rural in Ireland and also, I guess, the partnership you guys just announced with Convera. Can you comment on the international value proposition itself, whether it's sort of largely the same as it is in the U.S.? Or are there distinctive products, needs, partnerships required in these markets that you guys sort of still need to build out to more fully execute on the international opportunity?"", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes, I'll start, and [you Mari] can add here in a second. So as you know, if you look at our revenue as international revenue as a percentage of the total, and it's not where we'd like it to be, even though roughly 40% of the people we pay around the world are in international. So -- and the reason for that is that we have fundamentally different offers in the U.S. We have things like PEO. We also have money movement services, tax services, pretty much broadly distributed. Some of those offers don't have the same value proposition outside of the U.S. market. So our opportunity there is not quite the same. Perhaps it will be as time goes on, some of those services may be available in other markets. But as we speak today, they're not there, the value prop isn't the same. And with respect to Convera as a partner, just to speak to that a little bit, we have thousands of clients and those thousands of clients have thousands of entities spread across multiple countries around the world. And if you think about the complexity and the difficulty of paying their people in some of these small countries and then getting the payments to the various social security providers in those countries. Having somebody like Convera who can help a large European or a large U.S. multinational managed the treasury function in those small countries around the world without having to set up all the banking, et cetera. Someone like Convera actually is a great partner for us to facilitate those cross-border payments in a very -- in a compliant way, et cetera. So I think that's very positive for us. So we do have some partners in international, like Convera, as I just mentioned, but we still see it as a great opportunity for us to continue to grow."", 'Maria Black', ""That's right. If I may, one of the things I think what Don is suggesting is really, the opportunity we have with international. And so when you put it in the context of what the business that we have in the U.S., there is a tremendous opportunity for us to think more broadly in international partnerships as the one Don just outlined with Convera is a big piece of that. What I would also add is that -- from an international perspective, we did call out the performance specifically in Q2 on international. That's, by the way, in bookings. That's on the heels of a solid Q1. What I would offer as well as we have record retention. We have record customer experience and client experience in international. So I think we have a tremendous value proposition in international. By the way, some of the recognition I cited during the prepared remarks is really about how best-in-class our offer is with respect to the international offering we have. So that said, as Don mentioned, we're not satisfied. I think there's more opportunity to get scaled and grow are beyond payroll offerings partnerships are a big piece of that. But undoubtedly, we're performing and competing very, very well internationally."", 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', 'Fantastic sounds like good things ahead. Appreciate it.', 'Maria Black', ""Oh, you know what, let me just comment because you mentioned role in international. So I just thought I'd mention that really quickly, which is we are very excited about the down market and international role is one way that we're getting after that. And the pilot programs that we're running are teaching us a lot as we think about the down market and international."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.', 'Bryan Connell Keane', ""Congrats on the solid results. Don, I just want to ask about average balances. I know we were expecting a little bit of a headwind from the payroll tax deferral. Maybe you can quantify that as part of the reason for the drop of balances down 2%? And then what's the go forward there we should expect? Is there a more of a headwind from the payroll tax deferral for balances and maybe expect a similar decline in the back half of this year?"", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""No, I think you are right to call out the payroll deferral -- payroll tax deferral. That definitely was behind the decline quarter-to-quarter. We don't -- that's now behind us, so that's not going to be there. So we are expecting 2% to 3% balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. So we think that's very positive. I think a big call out though on the whole CFI program is just the fact that since we spoke last 5-year and 10-year interest rates are down about 80 bps on both of those. And so I think that's a little bit of a headwind, and that's roughly the $20 million or so that we're calling down the flow number for the balance of the year. But still very optimistic about growth. Certainly, the reason that it's not growing as quickly perhaps as it did last year, we've certainly seen some moderation in wage growth. And we've talked about even though pays per control behaving as we expected, they are certainly lower -- pays per control growth is lower than it was in the back half and will be lower in the back half of this year than it was in the back half of last year. So -- and those would be the major influencers, if you will, to the full balance as we go forward to the back half."", 'Bryan Connell Keane', 'Got it. And is that part of moving of the ES margins to the lower end of kind of the range you talked about. I think you talked about rates there. Just what was the surprise from 3 months ago on rates that maybe caused you to push the margins towards the lower end or where you think the lower end of the new margin range.', 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes, so you're right. I think the float certainly is a component of us guiding to the middle of our range for sure. So that's a component. We don't try to second guess the markets. We use yield curves that are out turning the market to estimate what we think our returns are going to be. So no real surprises other than seeing what's happening in the overall market, and then we're taking the forward yield curves and applying those to our balances, and that's where we land."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.', 'Scott Darren Wurtzel', ""Maybe just wanted to start off on some trends that we've seen so far in the selling season. It seems like through 2Q, it was pretty positive on the bookings side. But maybe wondering how we've sort of tracked into 3Q? And then also what you've seen maybe from competitors, any changes in pricing go-to-market strategy and all that would be helpful."", 'Maria Black', ""Scott, we feel good about the demand environment overall at this point. I think companies are still hiring. We saw that this morning actually as well. And companies are still investing in their people, their talent, they're investing in HR I think there are a couple of things I'd highlight to you. The down market, definitely companies are continuing to hire, and they're continuing to buy. We have tremendous second quarter results. By the way, that business has been executing incredibly well really for many, many quarters. And that's our Run offering, but it's also all the things that are attached to Run, so I think insurance services, retirement services all of the down market is doing incredibly well to give you a little bit of a line of sight as it is the 31st of January. So we do actually have a tiny bit of visibility specifically to the down market. And you asked about trends into the third quarter. What I would offer to you is January looks good. I think we're actually on track to onboard something close to like 30,000 units in that business alone in the month of January. And so that's the size of some companies, if you will. So it's pretty incredible to see the execution in the down market. We have solid pipelines really across the mid-market, well drop market, the mid-market did incredibly well. In the second quarter, from a competitive standpoint, I think we get a lot of questions around the competitive landscape. Has it shifted in the mid-market? What I would offer to you is it hasn't really shifted. It's been a competitive space for us for a long time. It's an area for us that we're executing very, very well. We have best-in-class products. We continue to take friction away from our clients, make it easy for our clients to engage with us. We know this based on our results and retention. We know this based on our results and record NPS. We had good bookings in the mid-market. So I think the mid-market is solid and certainly not getting any easier for our clients to be employers in the mid-market. As it relates to the international space, I think I covered that already, so I won't touch much more on international, but a good Q2 on the heels of a good Q1. And then in our enterprise and upmarket space, this is an area that has normally, I think it's kind of the norm -- new normal on longer deal cycles that have more individuals involved in those cycles. So we're paying close attention to it. And certainly, all the things that are happening kind of across that space, but I would suggest to you that we feel relatively solid about our pipelines and our ability to bring that business in the back half."", 'Scott Darren Wurtzel', ""Great. That's helpful. And just a follow-up for Don. Just on the float income guidance, sort of noticed a pretty notable increase on your outlook for the client short portfolio. So just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of color on sort of the change in geography on those investments for the balance of the year."", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes. So maybe let me clarify that for you a little bit. So really, we haven't changed our investment strategy at all. What we have done is we've tweaked a little bit the way we were going to -- we were borrowing funds in the market day in and day out. So what you're seeing is we're actually entering the market a little bit early. So instead of borrowing everything we need to on a peak borrowing day. We've simply spread the borrowing out over 2, 3 days so that we can tap the market in a more -- in a smoother way, if you will. And I think if you're looking at the average balances on that -- on the appendix sheet that's in the release, you'll notice that, that number has gone up in the short a fair bit, but that's the driver. So it's not a change in our investment strategy at all. It's just a change in a bit of a tweak in the way we're actually borrowing funds in the market when we need larger amounts of -- when we have larger amounts of borrowing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.', 'Bryan C. Bergin', ""First question I had is on EBIT margin. Can you comment on what drove the outperformance versus your view for that to be down, I think, in 2Q? I'm curious if that was an aspect of timing within the year versus better-than-expected efficiency. And I think, Don, I heard you mentioned some Gen AI investments to come. Is that incremental spend versus the prior plan?"", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""So yes, let me start, Bryan, let me start with the first part of your question. So -- there was a little bit of modest revenue outperformance in the quarter. So I think that was a contributor to the margin. And then we had some expenses we always have focused on expenses. There's a few things, a little bit of bad debt, a little bit of head count, et cetera, and perhaps a little bit of timing, but nothing significant to really call out as a contributor. In terms of the Gen AI spend, yes, we are spending a little bit more than we said we were going to last quarter. So we do have a bit of incremental spend. It's not a huge amount, but I know that lots of folks like to measure things in 10 bps. So we are calling it out. Not an incredible amount, but a little bit more than we had said in the prior quarter."", 'Bryan C. Bergin', ""Okay. And then just, I guess, a follow-up then on Gen AI and ADP assist here. Is that a feature you're able to monetize directly or more so kind of an enhancement you're offering for free to drive the CSAT scores higher? And I guess understanding you're leaning into these developments, do you kind of view -- you think about the monetization of Gen AI products. Is this a near-term dynamic or more so kind of feature and product differentiation that's a longer-term modernization dynamic?"", 'Maria Black', ""So Brian, ADP Assist is really the overarching, call it, brand, if you will, that we're leveraging to talk through all the things that we're putting into our products to make things easier. The way that I think about it is it's really just the next phase of digital transformation for ADP using new tools and technology. So said differently, our intention is not to charge to make things easier for our clients to do business. That is our commitment to our clients, always has been is to make it as easy as possible to process payroll to have accurate payrolls. And so it's not a monetization effort as it stands. It's really about just leveraging the new technology to step change the digital transformation that we've had underway candidly, for many, many decades since the dawn of the computing era. So -- that's kind of how we're thinking about ADP Assist in terms of monetization in general. Do I believe there's monetization as it relates to Gen AI? Of course, I think it's more about the dollar long term, right? So I think about it, the dollars that we're putting in today will yield multiple dollars for us in years to come. So there will be distinct monetization opportunities as we create new products into the market as we think about various things of that nature, perhaps features and functionality. There will also be gains in sales and retention that will lead, in my mind to investments that are proven today in Gen AI to drive incremental bookings and retention over the long term. So I think it's about putting a dollar in today with the belief that it will yield many dollars of margin to come, if you will, as well as bookings, et cetera."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.', 'Samad Saleem Samana', ""Maybe on the PEO business, I was curious, I know you guys called out some of the bigger verticals inside of the PEO business and that there's maybe some more softness there than you had expected in technology and professional services. Any change in the exposure other than side of the PEO business or within like the big verticals? Are you guys seeing any change in the trends that you saw maybe over the last couple of quarters?"", 'Maria Black', ""The trend in specifically, professional services have stabilized. And so I think Danny made the comment earlier, it's no longer contributing to the deceleration. So it used to the professional services cohort used to contribute to the acceleration of pays per control than we found ourselves where it was contributing to a deceleration and it's largely stabilized at this time."", 'Samad Saleem Samana', ""Got you. And just as you think about the pricing environment, I know that we're still not at when the company does the annual price increases. But as you think about maybe for new deals or for new customers that are onboarding any change in the kind of price pressure or competitive nature of what your competitors are offering in terms of discounts or what ADP is having to offer? And just as we look ahead of price increases, how are you thinking about this year's price increase?"", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes. We're not really seeing any changes, Samad, in the price environment, the competitive environment. We think we're priced appropriately. And we've always acknowledged that we're a little bit more premium to others, but we're happy with that because we think we offer a better service and stability, et cetera. So no real changes. You're right. It is a little bit of really the budget cycle kicks off here in the next 6, 8 weeks or so, and we'll certainly be looking at the pricing increases for next year and weighing all the regular factors, what's inflation being. We thought our price increases were very well received last year. We thought they were in line -- so we'll keep that in mind. But as always, we're always interested in the long-term value prop with our clients and being competitive in the market. So we're always measured, I believe, when we think about the price increases that we do hand out to our clients."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with UBS.', 'Kevin Damien McVeigh', ""Great. Maria, I think you talked to kind of implementations a little bit. Can you remind us maybe what percentage of the revenue is done internally on implementations today? And if that's a shift philosophically what that can be over the course it's on. If I heard the remark, right? Maybe I picked it up wrong, but just any incremental thoughts on that?"", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes, maybe, Kevin, you're a bit soft, by the way, but you're a little bit hard to hear, but I think the question was what kind of revenue we derive from implementation and..."", 'Kevin Damien McVeigh', 'Yes.', 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes. So it's not a substantial sub-10% of our overall revenue comes from setup we internally call setup fees. So it's not a substantial amount."", 'Kevin Damien McVeigh', 'And then do you see that down over time? Does that become less if you outsource that? And is there any way to think about the margin impact from that initiative?', 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Well, I mean you also -- so no, I don't think there's a big opportunity there. We certainly have had conversations. We certainly have lots of folks who would like us to outsource our implementation because they think it's a revenue stream for them. We like to have that control over the client from sale through to go live in service, not to say that we won't work with third parties to help us from time to time, which we do. But it's really not that large a factor. Certainly, there's some money there to be had, but it's not that large a factor in the overall scheme of things. There's also some interesting accounting, of course, around implementation and set-up fees and the deferral over the terms of the contract. So once again, it would take a lot of changes to do anything, make any changes of the bottom-line financials in the near term."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.', 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""Good results here. Just wanted to dig in on your prior comments. I know a lot of people asked on PEO and the healthy activity there and the confidence of the acceleration. Is ADP doing anything differently? Or is industry demand changing? I understand it's not -- doesn't sound like if there's a cost or pricing change there. So I just want to make sure I understood that."", 'Maria Black', ""Thank you. I'm happy to talk about PEO bookings. I think -- as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're very pleased with our PEO bookings. This really is the fourth quarter that we've seen positive PEO bookings momentum. And the Q2 specifically exceeded our expectations -- most of the pressure that we felt in the PEO has been a byproduct of kind of the pressure on that pays per control and having to overcome that, which is why the focus on bookings has been so paramount for us. And certainly, we delivered that in the second quarter. In terms of from a demand perspective, I speak about the PEO all the time, as you know. I think the demand continues to be incredibly strong. I wouldn't suggest that there's anything unnatural that we are doing outside of a tremendous amount of focus across the enterprise to ensure that we're executing on the PEO bookings side, but in terms of anything unnatural or demand changing. I think the value proposition, as I always say, it's stronger than it's ever been. I think clients in that space are looking toward ADP to help them from a PEO value proposition, so everything from payroll to benefits to navigating the complexity of being a business and having the ability to execute on our employment relationships. So I would say the value proposition is as strong as it's ever been. I think it remains strong. The demand is there. The organization is focused on PEO bookings as an execution lever for us, and I'm pleased to see that we did just that in Q2, and we really had -- this marks the fourth quarter of positive bookings momentum from the PEO."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Caroline, I'm on for Jason. Thanks for taking our question. So pays per control growth has been 2% quarterly through the first half. But the guide for full year '24 is still 1% to 2%. So what are the drivers of the second half deceleration? Or do you think that the high end has become more likely?"", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Caroline, thanks for the question. We said we would go to -- we'd be 1% to 2% for the year, and we certainly have that 1% to 2% range still in the back half. we're not really anticipating any slowdown in pays per control, but we certainly have it built in. So perhaps we're a little bit conservative there. But as we sit here today, demand -- the employment demand continues to be robust, although still declining somewhat. But I think we're confident that in the back half, we're going to be declining a little bit, but still coming in on that 1% to 2% range for the year. Not much -- not really much more to say there, other than employment demand, labor markets continue to be maybe a bit softer than they were. But as we saw this morning at our NER report, hirings still out there, still good growth. So not a lot of extra color. I don't think that around pays per control."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho.', 'Dan Dolev', 'Great results here. Just a strategic question. Obviously, if you look over the next 12 to 18 months, interest rates are coming down, there is a big debate out there on the ability to offset some of those headwinds in terms of revenue. Can you talk about maybe some idiosyncratic initiatives that you could do to offset the headwind from declining interest rates.', 'Don Edward McGuire', ""I think that's really a macro question, I guess. I guess the macro answer to that would be that if interest rates start to decline, we'll see an offsetting increase just in economic activity. And if we see that increase in economic activity, we should see revenue go up, we should see bookings opportunities go up, et cetera. So I think that if interest rates come down and I know there's lots of debates whether it's 2 cuts or 4 cuts, et cetera, who knows?But if they do come down, we should certainly avoid the recession, nobody's asked about a recession on the call today, so thank you. I think the consensus is that there's not going to be a recession. So just certainly, any of the polls suggest that economy is healthy with 3.3% GDP growth in the last report. So if rates come down, the economy should remain healthy and a healthy economy should help continue to contribute to our growth."", 'Danyal Hussain', ""Dan, I'll just add also, our model involves reinvesting further out on the yield curve. And as you know, we're still reinvesting at higher rates than what's embedded in the securities that are rolling off. So even if we do start to see short-term interest rates fall next year, which is obviously consensus at this point, a lot of that will be offset by the reinvestments that we have further out on the yield curve. And so it's too early to be talking specifically about the interest rate outlook for next year, but we would just recommend you keep that in mind."", 'Don Edward McGuire', ""Yes, that's fair. I think if you look at our reinvestments, our current reinvestments are still up 4%, which is higher than our average yield today. So there still are opportunities. Our float is expected to continue to grow over the next 12 to 24 months. Certainly, it's going to grow more slowly than we would have expected at the end of last quarter. But there's still upside from flow, which is perhaps not as much upside."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi.', 'Peter Corwin Christiansen', ""Two questions. Now that we fully lap ERTC, I'm just curious if you've noticed any changes in client demand or competitive tactics, particularly in the down market."", 'Maria Black', ""Yes. Pete, the ERTC, as you know, and I think what you're referencing is the new deadline that was pulled forward 5 quarters actually. So the deadline actually, as it stands is potentially today. I think we're still waiting for the final kind of execution, if you will, of that new deadline. But arguably, we're having to execute on behalf of our clients with today in mind. And so there's a tremendous amount of volume that we are pushing through on behalf of our clients. And it has put pressure into the system, which is hard to watch and witness by the way, as it relates to the very clients that are supposed to be helped by this and the challenges that they're facing, trying to navigate it. So we're doing everything we can in our power to help and process these claims. In terms of financial impact for us, as it relates to ERTC, it isn't a financial impact to us. I think it's very de minimis as it relates to our overall revenue as it relates to our overall incremental. We really -- from a standpoint of what we're looking towards is about supporting our clients is I think some of our competitors have used it more as a business and a revenue than us as it relates to how we're thinking about it. But undoubtedly, the advancement of this deadline til today has not been ideal for really anyone engaged in it."", 'Peter Corwin Christiansen', ""That's helpful. And then I'm curious, the combination of HCM and payments functionality. It's certainly been a theme, EWA is obviously a big, big portion of that and that cross-border. Do you see opportunities to increase penetration there to add more capabilities either through partnership, M&A further into payments and I'm thinking perhaps even like disbursements, all those sorts of things."", 'Maria Black', ""From a strategic standpoint, Pete, what I would offer is continuing to solve for our clients and employees and how they engage with us. If you imagine across ADP, we paid 41 million wage earners in the U.S. that's [$25 million.] I think last time we talked about our widely offering what we disclosed was that we had 1.5 cardholders or something like that. So you just kind of give you the opportunity, scale of it. We believe there's tremendous opportunity to increase how we're engaging with our clients, whether that's through the likes of Wisely, it's through the likes of EWA as you're suggesting or it's any other type of payments and things that we can do to make it easier for our clients and employees to move through the world of work, right? And so the way I think about it and the partnerships that we're actively out there in the market talking to and thinking about are anywhere we can add value in our clients' and employee life and flow. So as they move through their day and they clock in through ADP's mobile app, which by the way, we have 10 million users that are actively using our ADP mobile apps. So as they're engaging with ADP, are there opportunities for us to insert value there, whether that's things like EWA, it's things like payments, it's things like financial and wellness apps like the companion app we have through Wisely. These are all top of mind for us as we go through our strategic discussions and as we think about partnerships in the future for ADP."", 'Operator', 'We have time for one last question, and that question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Ashish Sabadra', 'So just a multipart question on PE and following up on some of the commentary earlier on solid bookings and moderating PPC -- sorry, paper control headwinds -- as we look at the WSE growth, we have continued to see a sequential improvement there better than what we saw last year. And just given the commentary, is it fair for us to assume that we should continue to see that improve as we go through the year. And then on revenue per WSE, I was wondering if you could comment on looks like pricing trends are positive, but if you could comment on any other puts and takes, participation, anything else that could help drive better revenue per worksite employee.', 'Maria Black', ""So the answer to your question is yes. We do expect that the bookings contribution, coupled with a bit of stability on the pays per control side, coupled with retention getting more favorable in the back half. All of those things should lead to the reacceleration that Don mentioned earlier that we've been pointing to in the back half I think in terms of other componentry within the PEO, you mentioned a few of them. There's payroll per works unemployed, there's workers' compensation, there's state unemployment -- some of these things are things that we're still waiting to really see the outcomes. I'll give you an example. One of those is state unemployment in terms of, obviously, we sit here today forecasting what that looks like. Most of those rates are issued throughout this quarter. And so while we have some line of sight, in the end, we don't know entirely what the state unemployment outcome. We do expect that it creates a little bit of a rates are going down year-on-year again this year. But again, only time will tell. Sometimes the states, as an example, make very strange decisions that aren't always in line with what's happening from a broader labor and unemployment perspective. So all that to say, I think -- I don't know that I could sit here today and give you any componentry that seems strange or out of the norm. I think they are all things we're watching as we look toward the reacceleration of the PEO in the back half."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for any closing remarks."", 'Maria Black', ""Yes. So really quickly, I think I'll end with how I ended my prepared remarks, which is a huge shout out to all of the associates and the entire ecosystem across ADP. So that's ADP associates, partners, channels all of the stakeholders that really contributed to what was a good, good solid Q2 but also a good solid first half. I'm really excited about the back half and what we'll accomplish not just in fiscal '24, but moreover in calendar 2024. It's a time and it's an exciting year for ADP. This year is the year that we actually round our 75th anniversary. And when I think about who this company is over the last 7 decades and 75 years? I can't see -- I can't wait to see what we're going to do in the next 75. So look forward to sharing in that celebration with all of you as we head into 2024 together.

Numerous American companies have adhered to this principle, contributing to a notable increase in dividend distributions over the years. S&P Dow Jones Indices data revealed that the dividend payments of S&P 500 companies totaled $420 billion in 2017, surging to $565 billion in 2022. The trend continued in 2023, setting a new record with dividend payments reaching an impressive $588.2 billion. The most recent report from S&P Dow Jones pointed out that there were 707 instances of dividend increases in the fourth quarter of 2023. The cumulative amount of these increases reached $17.5 billion for the quarter, marking an increase from the $16.3 billion reported in the same period of 2022.', 'Companies displaying consistent growth in dividends have attracted the interest of investors, prompting companies to undertake the challenging task of sustaining and expanding their dividends, even during market downturns. This strategic approach has proven to be beneficial for these companies, as those experiencing dividend growth have yielded substantial returns over the years. According to a Cohen & Steers report, during the decade leading up to 2010, dividend-paying companies outpaced non-payers by 620 basis points annually, with significantly lower risk measured by standard deviation. Over a 30-year period ending in 2011, the advantage of dividend-paying companies becomes even more pronounced. Notably, across each time frame during this period, the subset of dividend payers that increased or initiated dividends in the preceding 12 months exhibited higher returns and lower volatility compared to both payers and non-payers.', 'Aside from delivering robust returns, consistent dividend stocks have been playing a significant role in generating personal income. As per findings from S&P Dow Jones Indices, dividends have progressively become a more substantial source of income over the past four decades. In December 1981, dividends constituted only 2.88% of total income, a figure that has increased to 6.25% of all income as of March 2022. The report also highlighted the average year-over-year annual percentage growth rate in dividends for the existing constituents of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index. Over the last 15 years, the average year-over-year dividend growth rate stood at 13.71%, outpacing the average year-over-year U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of 2.21% during the same timeframe.', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

UDR, a premier multifamily real estate investment trust (REIT), is set to announce its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results after the closing bell on Feb 6. Its quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential REIT came up with FFO as adjusted per share of 63 cents, in line with the consensus mark. Quarterly results reflected year-over-year growth in revenues. UDR also benefited from past accretive external growth investments. However, a rise in interest expenses acted as a dampener.In the last four quarters, UDR’s FFO as adjusted per share met the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions for as many misses, the average negative surprise being -0.81%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:', 'United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. price-eps-surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Quote', 'Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.', 'Per RealPage data, although there was a significant recovery in apartment demand in the fourth quarter, it was not enough to keep up with the huge amounts of new supply, with the onslaught affecting occupancy and rent growth.There was demand for 58,200 units in the fourth quarter, pushing the total demand figure to 233,741 units in the 12-month period, which marked a considerable change from net move-outs from 123,290 units recorded in 2022. However, there were massive amounts of new supply, with 129,015 units being delivered in the fourth quarter across the top 150 markets tracked by RealPage, bringing the total number of units delivered to 439,394 in 2023.With supply outpacing demand, the occupancy level was 94.2%, contracting 30 basis points (bps) in the quarter and 90 points year over year. Apart from the occupancy rate, operators’ pricing power was also affected, with fourth-quarter rents contracting 1.3% but increasing 0.2% in the year. The monthly rent was $1,805, while the rent per square foot was $1.986.', 'UDR owns a geographically diverse portfolio with a superior product mix of A/B quality properties in urban and suburban markets. The company’s portfolio comprises properties throughout the United States, including both coastal and Sunbelt locations, with a good mix of urban and suburban communities.UDR’s technological investments and process enhancements are expected to have helped enhance cost control and aided margin expansion via its Next Generation Operating Platform. The platform allows the company to electronically interact with and provide service to residents, aiding its business prospects. Its healthy balance sheet position is likely to have boosted its growth endeavors.However, the elevated supply of rental units in some of its markets may have increased competition and partly limited rent growth, casting a pall on the company’s quarterly performance to a certain extent. In addition, a high interest rate environment is likely to have acted as a spoilsport.Per the company’s November Investor Presentation, UDR noted that it enjoyed 96.8% average occupancy in October, up from 96.7% in the third quarter of 2023. UDR experienced blended lease rate growth of around 0.5% through Nov 10, while the resident turnover was lower on a year-over-year basis for the sixth consecutive month in October.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $409.41 million. This indicates a 2.76% year-over-year rise.For the fourth quarter, we estimate same-store physical occupancy at 96.6%. Moreover, our estimate for same-store net operating income growth is currently pegged at 2.8%. We expect interest expenses to grow 8.9% year over year in the fourth quarter.UDR projected fourth-quarter 2023 FFO as adjusted per share in the range of 62-64 cents.Before the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO as adjusted per share has remained unchanged at 63 cents in the past month. However, this suggests year-over-year growth of 3.28%.For the full year 2023, UDR expected FFO as adjusted per share in the range of $2.46-$2.48. This is based on the company’s projection of year-over-year growth in same-store cash revenues of 5.4-5.9% and same-store NOI growth in the range of 6-6.5%.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO as adjusted per share is pegged at $2.47. The figure indicates a 6.01% increase year over year on 6.93% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.62 billion.', 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for UDR this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.UDR currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Eaton is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ETN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.47 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ETN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.20% heading into earnings season.', 'Eaton Corporation, PLC price-eps-surprise | Eaton Corporation, PLC Quote', 'A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 2.4%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Aflac ', ""We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Aflac's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", 'EPS is set to fall by 1.9% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 26%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.70, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.', ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Earnings has been rising at 3.1% per annum over the last five years, which admittedly is a bit slow. If Aflac is struggling to find viable investments, it always has the option to increase its payout ratio to pay more to shareholders."", ""Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Aflac is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Aflac (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing.

This represents a year-over-year change of 15.46% and 4.46%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'Universal Health Services may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Universal Health Services has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 13.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 15.4X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 8.6X versus its peer group's average of 9.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.37. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', ""We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Universal Health Services currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates."", 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Universal Health Services passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Universal Health Services shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.', 'How Does UHS Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of UHS have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA). HCA has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of A.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter.

Its core metal, copper, is usually seen as the commodity most sensitive to economic growth – not least due to its importance in electrification.', 'In a year of slowing global growth, Freeport has maintained an excellent level of profitability and has several catalysts enabling it to benefit from any copper price increase. As such, the stock remains an excellent choice for commodity investors.', ""It's impossible to avoid discussing the future direction of the price of copper when looking at Freeport. The company's realized price of copper per pound was $3.85 in 2023, following $3.90 in 2022. But don't be fooled by how stable those numbers seem. The price of copper per pound fluctuated from $4.25 last January to as low as $3.54 in October."", 'Still, an overall decline of just $0.05 per pound in a year of slowing global growth is a good result for Freeport and indicates a good level of support for the price of copper.', 'In addition, as company president Kathleen Quirk said on the earnings call: ""It\'s obvious that there haven\'t been new projects sanctioned in our industry for some time. And what\'s happened recently in recent years with the copper prices rallying and then falling off has just caused more delays, more cautiousness by developers in developing the project.""', 'In other words, the supply is being constrained by the decline in price. At the same time, CEO Richard Adkerson said, inventories of copper around the world are at historically low levels, ""and the inventory levels are really inconsistent with the current copper price.""', 'Given these dynamics, any upside surprise in demand in 2024 will likely lead to upward pressure on the price of copper.', 'That said, most economic forecasters predict slightly slower global growth in 2024, which could weigh on demand growth. As always, there are puts and takes when looking at commodities.', ""It makes sense to take a conservative approach and assume the price approximates to its current level, at $3.86 per pound. Freeport's management estimates its earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) will be $10 billion per annum in 2025/2026 at a copper price of $4 per pound. Its current enterprise value (EV) of around $61 billion would put the stock on a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.1 times EBITDA."", ""That's an excellent valuation if you like the long-term outlook for the price of copper, driven by demand from the economy's electrification trend."", ""It isn't just about the price of copper; after all, Freeport still has to produce more to benefit from any positives in the metal's prices. Fortunately, the company is in a good position for two reasons."", 'First, it\'s making good progress on its low-cost leaching initiative, having hit its target of an annual run rate of 200 million pounds of copper in the fourth quarter. Management forecasts it will produce 200 million pounds of copper from leaching in 2024 and get to a run rate of 400 million pounds ""within a couple of years,"" according to Quirk. It has the potential to hit 800 million pounds per annum over time. For reference, Freeport expects to sell 4.1 billion pounds of copper in 2024, so the leaching initiative is significant.', 'Second, management outlined it had a ""brownfield growth pipeline"" of 1.7 billion pounds of copper within eight years, with 400 million pounds able to be added within two to three years. Consequently, Freeport has the potential to invest in projects and take advantage of higher prices or better conditions.', ""All told, if you believe that the risk for the price of copper in 2024 is on the upside, then Freeport is a great stock to invest in. Its leaching initiatives and brownfield development potential mean it has the resources to ramp up production in a world that's finding it increasingly hard to add supply. Meanwhile, the demand kicker from the electrification-of-everything trend has a multiyear growth pathway ahead."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Freeport-McMoRan right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Freeport-McMoRan, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Freeport-McMoRan wasn't one of them.

The snack and beverage giant will announce its Q4 results in early February, likely confirming that demand trends held up well through late December despite slower consumer spending in some parts of the economy."", ""Pepsi will also issue its first official 2024 forecast, along with a new outlook on its capital return plans. These updates could spark volatility for the stock around the Feb. 9 earnings report. But investors are better off ignoring that noise to focus on Pepsi's wider ambitions and opportunities for 2024 and beyond. Let's take a closer look."", ""Pepsi entered the Q4 period with the wind at its back. Organic revenue was up 9% last quarter thanks to solid growth across the drink and snack portfolio. Each of Pepsi's product categories and geographic markets contributed to these gains, keeping the company on pace to increase sales by 10% this year on top of last year's 14% spike."", ""It wasn't all good news in the Q3 report, though. Pepsi's volume dipped in the food segment and was flat in its global beverage division. Coca-Cola, in contrast, reported a healthier mix between rising prices and increased sales volumes. For the stock to generate better returns, Pepsi will need to close that performance gap so that it doesn't have to rely solely on rising prices to boost organic sales."", ""The outlook is more clearly positive around earnings, which are expanding at a solid clip these days. Profitability rose last quarter thanks to the combination of those increased prices and Pepsi's slowing cost inflation. These gains translated into a 16% earnings spike in Q3. Pepsi lifted its 2023 earnings forecast in response to that strong growth, and that's why most Wall Street pros are looking for profits to rise about 12% to $7.55 per share for the full year."", 'Shareholder returns this year will be bolstered by direct cash. PepsiCo delivered an estimated $8 billion to investors through 2023, or about the same level as in the prior year. That includes $7 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share buybacks.', ""The February earnings report will include Pepsi's updated capital return outlook as well. Watch for the dividend to rise significantly given the company's strong expected earnings growth. Last year's boost was 10%, for context."", ""The good news is that Pepsi stock is reasonably priced considering all of these positive factors. Shares are valued at 2.5 times annual sales, or less than half of Coca-Cola's premium. On the downside, it is far less profitable, and its growth isn't quite as robust. Yet you get a lot of value in owning this business, including diversified exposure to the packaged foods industry, a fast-growing dividend, and the potential for rebounding profitability over the coming years."", 'Investors who would prefer to watch this stock from the sidelines should follow operating profit margin for signs of a sustained uptick. That success would likely help Pepsi shares break out of their underperformance rut.', 'Yet, taking on a bit more risk here is likely to pay off over the long term. Pepsi has a great shot at accelerating sales and earnings growth over the next several years, starting with a modestly bullish 2024 outlook from the management team in early February.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PepsiCo wasn't one of them.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the bottled water industry, you may go to 5 Highest Quality Bottled Water Brands in The US.', 'Bottled water usage is high where there is a lack of trust in the public water supply services. This can mean two things: one, the quality of water being provided by public water supplies is not high-quality or may even be contaminated, and two: the consumers do not trust the quality of public water supply and prefer bottled water instead. As a small example: a report by WebMD highlights US tap water to have acidic water ranging from 4.3 to 5.3 on the pH scale instead of healthy drinking water which is supposed to be marked at 7 on the pH scale.', 'On the consumer side, there seems to be a rise in health concerns for the contents of bottled water itself, including the source, carbonation, total dissolved solids, and pH levels. This phenomenon has been highlighted in our article on the Best Water Damage Restoration Services in Each of 30 Biggest Cities in the US.', 'The popularity of bottled water has taken this market to a value of USD 26.12 billion according to a\xa0report by Coherent Market Insights. Extending beyond its current size, the same report has estimated that the bottled water market in the US is likely to grow at a rate of 8.42% from the years 2023-2030 and reach USD 33.221 billion.', 'This popular demand of bottled water is being met by a large variety of companies and is largely segmented. Private Labels currently take up around 25% of the total market according to one report by one report by the Beverage Industry. The same report indicates that the leading brands in the bottled-water market in the US are Aquafina, Dasani, and Glaceau Smartwater, capturing around 8.5, 8.2 and 6.7% of the total bottled market industry, respectively. Diving deeper into understanding these industry leaders, we see that they are run by familiar faces of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) making Aquafina, and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) making Dasani and Smartwater both.', ""These industry leaders have utilized some key ways to reduce cost and move towards sustainability as a source of market differentiation. The most obvious example of this was The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO)'s move towards making Dasani's packaging from 100% recycled PET in 2022. Even prior to that PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) after much deliberation launched aluminum cans as packaging for Aquafina in 2020. On the other hand, The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO)'s strategy with Smartwater for differentiation in the market has been through advertisement and endorsements. The most recent example of this is acclaimed actor Zendaya's endorsement of Smartwater announced in August 2023."", 'By this point, it should be understood that bottled water has a sizable and growing market and quality has begun to become a major deciding factor for consumers. The question then is: why does the content of bottled water matter so much? It is because not all bottled water is made equal. While there are differences in taste that may be important to consumers, the health impacts may be even more important. For instance, magnesium content varies significantly from one brand to another and this meta-analysis by the National Library of Medicine has highlighted that water with high magnesium may be linked to lower risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).', 'Having understood that there is a quality-conscious consumer segment in the sizeable and growing bottled water industry in the US and that there is a benefit to having better quality water, we sought to rank the top 15 highest quality bottled water brands in the US.', ""Let's now head over to the list of the highest quality bottled-water brands in the US."", 'Copyright: bee32 / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Since measuring the quality of this essential product is very subjective, we have used the consensus approach to collect data for this article.

In addition to locking in a higher-than-usual yield, you may also benefit from a rising price in the months and years ahead. PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB), and Unilever (NYSE: UL) are three stocks that provide investors with high yields and could be great places to invest $5,000 in today.', 'Soft drink and snack giant PepsiCo makes for a well-diversified company to invest in. Its Pepsi products are well-known around the world, and the company has been expanding through acquisitions to help generate additional growth opportunities. When it last reported earnings in October, its year-to-date organic revenue growth rate was impressive at 11.8%. Its core earnings per share, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was also up by 16% year over year.', ""PepsiCo's business has been able to pass along rising costs to consumers without feeling the effects of a significant drop in volume, as is evident with its strong top- and bottom-line results. In the past year, however, shares of PepsiCo have been flat, as investors may have grown concerned about its ability to rely on price increases for continued growth."", ""But with a strong brand and a wide range of products, this is still an excellent business to invest in. PepsiCo's dividend yields 3%, and on a $5,000 investment you could be collecting $150 in annual dividend income. Plus PepsiCo is also a Dividend King, which means your dividend income is likely to rise in value over the years."", ""Currently, PepsiCo's stock is trading within 10% of its 52-week low of $155.83. Now could be an opportune time to add it to your portfolio."", 'Kimberly-Clark is another Dividend King known for its consistent hikes. On Jan. 24, the company announced it would be raising its dividend for a 52nd consecutive year, boosting its quarterly dividend by 3.4% to $1.22 every quarter. With the new dividend, investors will be earning a 4% yield on the stock -- more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.5%. On a $5,000 investment, that would result in $200 in annual dividend income.', ""The consumer goods company, known for popular brands such as Huggies and Cottonelle, recently reported its year-end numbers for 2023, which looked fairly strong. The company finished the year achieving an organic sales growth rate of 5%. Although Kimberly-Clark's operating profit fell by 13% to $2.3 billion, that was due to impairment charges related to intangible assets totaling $658 million. Otherwise it was a strong showing for the business."", ""Kimberly-Clark's stock has fallen 6% in the past 12 months and is close to its 52-week low of $116.32. For dividend investors seeking some long-term stability, this is another good stock to consider buying right now."", ""Rounding out this list is Unilever, a massive company known for its household and personal products. Odds are you probably have some of its products in your fridge, pantry, or washroom. From Ben & Jerry's ice cream to its Dove personal care products, Unilever has a broad range of strong brands in its portfolio. "", 'During the first nine months of 2023, the company reported underlying sales growth of 7.7%. The company has relied heavily on price increases, reporting 5.8% price growth in the third quarter (which ended on Sept. 30, 2023) and a 0.6% decline in volume. While the growth may slow down as inflation cools, Unilever is primarily going to attract income investors for its yield and stability.', ""Boasting a 3.8% payout, this is another fairly high-yielding dividend stock to own, and a $5,000 investment could generate $190 in yearly dividend income. Although Unilever isn't a Dividend King, it has increased its payouts in recent years. And with a payout ratio of 52%, there's room for the company to raise its dividends in the future."", 'Unilever stock is within just a few dollars of its 52-week low of $46.16, and may be a good investment option to consider today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PepsiCo wasn't one of them.

A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.
