0,5452cc37-aa94-339e-b5b7-3e0600ebe69e,SCHW,2023-01-20,Should Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF (FNDA) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-u-small-company-112011946.html,1674213611,STORY,"['^RUT', 'SCHW']","[Designed to provide broad exposure to the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF (FNDA) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 08/13/2013.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $6.07 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap ValueSmall cap companies have market capitalization below $2 billion. They usually have higher potential than large and mid cap companies with stocks but higher risk.While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.31%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 19.50% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, First Solar Inc (FSLR) accounts for about 0.42% of total assets, followed by Geo Group Reit Inc (GEO) and Valmont Inds Inc (VMI).The top 10 holdings account for about 2.36% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskFNDA seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Story continuesThe ETF has gained about 4.99% so far this year and is down about -7.01% in the last one year (as of 01/20/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.52 and $54.89.The ETF has a beta of 1.17 and standard deviation of 31.37% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 976 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FNDA is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and the Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF (VBR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $12.27 billion in assets, Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF has $24.66 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VBR charges 0.07%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It was the lowest since April.“Data releases like this are why policymakers continue to reiterate their intention to raise rates,” Jefferies said.Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Thursday insisted the Fed was “determined to stay the course"" on monetary policy tightening, and would keep rates “sufficiently restrictive for some time"" to ensure inflation returns to the central bank’s 2% target.The remarks from the Fed vice chair on keeping rates higher for longer have added to concerns that the Fed could overtighten policy, tipping the economy into recession.The earnings front, meanwhile, did little to allay those fears about the economy and the consumer.Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) fell more than 4%, leading consumer stocks lower, after the cruise company warned that it expected to report a net loss for the quarter and full year.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also added to downside momentum, falling 1%, as many worry the EV maker’s quarterly results could fall short of expectations amid slowing demand and disruption to productions in China.Banking and insurance stocks, meanwhile, continued to pressure financials, paced by a slump in Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS), Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), and Charles Schwab Corp (NYSE:SCHW).Story continuesNorthern Trust Corporation reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street estimates, sending its share price more than 8% lower.

6,d19ab1c4-9646-344b-91e3-0f54f3d524e3,SCHW,2023-01-20,Charles Schwab and Girl Scouts of the USA Modernize Curriculum for Financial Literacy Badges,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-girl-scouts-usa-150000759.html,1674140400,STORY,"['SCHW', 'SCHW-PD', 'SCHW-PJ']","[New Girl Scouts curriculum addresses gender bias, fosters economic empowerment, and aligns to current financial education best practicesWESTLAKE, Texas, January 19, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In time for Girl Scout Cookie season, Charles Schwab announced a partnership with Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) to modernize and relaunch the Girl Scouts' financial literacy badges for girls from kindergarten through high school. The new financial literacy curriculum includes topics like building wealth, entrepreneurship, fraud awareness, budgeting for different goals throughout life and investing basics. The emphasis on financial wellness aims to help bridge the gap between what girls learn in school and what they need to feel confident managing finances in life and business.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230119005149/en/(Photo: Business Wire)Learning about financial literacy is an important component of the Girl Scout Cookie Program, the largest entrepreneurial program for girls in the world, which offers real-world opportunities to apply lessons learned around goal setting, budgeting and planning, critical thinking, collaboration, and organization.""The lessons learned from the financial literacy badges lay a strong foundation for the cookie sales program,"" said Casey Cortese, director, Schwab Community Services and former Girl Scout. ""Not only do girls learn the basics of understanding how money works, but they also get a voice in how the funds raised through cookie sales are used by their troops – whether it helps fund special troop activities or to invest in giving back to their communities. They learn the value of money and see first-hand its impact on their current and future financial goals.""Throughout Girl Scout history, badge programs have included topics related to economics and money management. For example, the Matron Housekeeper badge, introduced in 1913, encouraged girls to understand how groceries were sold, by package, pound or bulk, and the first badge devoted to financial literacy, the Economist Badge, offered between 1922 and 1928, taught girls to track earnings and allowances, and oversee family’s groceries expenses and menu planning to use food economically. In recent decades badge programs like Business-Wise, Consumer Power and Money Sense promoted entrepreneurship, earning, saving and spending money wisely.Story continuesResearch shows that, even today, boys and girls are often taught different financial topics. For example, boys are more likely than girls to be taught about wealth-building topics like investing, while financial education programming for girls continues to focus on topics such as household money management, budgeting and saving. The new Girl Scout curriculum addresses the gender bias that remains prevalent in the way girls and boys are taught about personal finance.""In business, women are scarce in top leadership and entrepreneurial positions, representing just 5% of CEOs and 12% of other top executives,"" said Wendy Lou, chief revenue officer at Girl Scouts of the USA. ""The new and updated GSUSA financial literacy programming is designed to empower and equip Girl Scouts as they contemplate career and personal aspirations, develop the skills needed to make a difference in their own lives and the world, and open an accessible pathway for girls to fill these roles.""In designing the new financial literacy badge series, Schwab supported GSUSA to create an activity-based experience to engage girls throughout their school years, tailored to their age and interests through a modular approach.At the earliest stages of the new curriculum, Daisies and Brownies in kindergarten through third grade explore everything from the difference between wants and needs and creating a budget and saving. In grades four through eight, Juniors and Cadettes focus on earning, budgeting, tracking spending, and giving back. In high school, Seniors and Ambassadors sharpen budgeting skills, learn about credit and credit cards, and explore investing and wealth management. An important element of the Girl Scout troop model is that it pairs high-quality programming with active role models and supportive adults, including parents, which is proven to amplify the impact and reach of programming.""It’s detrimental to send our girls out into the real world without the education and tools that can lead to financial independence,"" said Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, president of Charles Schwab Foundation and former Girl Scout. ""I have seen first-hand how impactful it is for girls to have female financial role models. Our partnership with Girls Scouts will help empower the next generations of young girls to lead at the highest levels of business and society.""GSUSA is one of the largest youth-serving organizations in the country, offering a myriad of opportunities for Schwab employees to volunteer and engage with local troops on financial literacy topics. In 2022, Schwab and GSUSA piloted volunteer models for financial literacy training in six key Schwab employment locations, aiming to create an effective and replicable employee engagement program that Schwab will launch nationally in 2023.About Charles SchwabAt Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) we believe in the power of investing to help individuals create a better tomorrow.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$7.3b after the stock price dropped 4.5% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Texas Instruments Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman, Richard Templeton, sold US$5.9m worth of shares at a price of US$178 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$171. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in Texas Instruments didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Texas Instruments Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Texas Instruments. In total, Senior VP &amp; CTO Ahmad R. S. Bahai dumped US$200k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Texas Instruments insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$168m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Texas Instruments Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Texas Instruments makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Texas Instruments (including 2 which are potentially serious).If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

16,6918e640-b36c-3bf5-8827-28f9fa12d96d,NUE,2023-01-20,Nucor (NUE) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-nue-expected-beat-earnings-150103518.html,1674140463,STORY,"['NUE', 'STLD']","[Nucor (NUE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis steel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -47.6%.Revenues are expected to be $7.91 billion, down 23.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nucor?For Nucor, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.54%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Nucor will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nucor would post earnings of $6.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.50, delivering a surprise of +0.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nucor appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, Steel Dynamics (STLD) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -37.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $4.73 billion, down 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Steel Dynamics has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 4.82%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Steel Dynamics will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nucor will manufacture Elcyon at the company's new, $1.7 billion state-of-the-art Nucor Brandenburg steel mill in Kentucky, which produced its first steel plate at the end of December 2022.""By launching Elcyon at Brandenburg we have effectively created the first domestic supply chain of sustainable steel for our nation's offshore wind energy industry,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. ""As demand for alternative energy sources like offshore wind continues to grow and manufacturers push for larger turbines, Elcyon's larger and thicker plate sizes will help the United States become a leader in offshore wind production.""Elcyon is a clean, advanced steel product made using Nucor's recycled scrap-based electric arc furnace manufacturing process. Nucor's circular steelmaking route has a greenhouse gas emissions intensity that is one fifth the global blast furnace extractive steelmaking average, based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Utilizing Thermo-Mechanical Controlled Processing (TMCP) at the new mill, Elcyon, the only steel of its kind in the United States was created specifically to meet the rigorous quality standards of offshore wind energy designers, manufacturers and fabricators. Along with meeting Euronorm specs, Elcyon is characterized by larger plate dimensions, improved weldability and excellent fracture toughness, as compared to competing products.Elcyon will be an essential component of the supply chain to continue developing our nation's offshore wind power infrastructure. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $300 billion for clean energy development and climate programs, supports the Biden Administration's goal to build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030. This could result in approximately 7.5 million tons of additional steel demand and create enough clean energy to power 10 million homes.Story continuesNucor Steel Brandenburg is the first steel plant in the world to pursue certification under LEED v4 from the U.S. Green Building Council, the highest standard for sustainable building design, construction, and operation. The new mill is located in the middle of the largest steel plate-consuming region in the country and will be able to produce 97% of plate products consumed domestically, with a potential output of 1.2 million tons of steel annually.Elcyon and the Brandenburg mill both draw upon Nucor's 50 years of industry leadership in sustainable steel production. From last year's launch of Econiq™, the world's first net-zero steel available at scale, to recently becoming the first major industrial company to join the United Nations 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Global Compact, Nucor has consistently worked to meet the needs of its customers and other stakeholders while protecting the well-being of our planet.""We continue to invest and build the recycled steel facilities that will help make our clean energy future a reality,"" said Johnny Jacobs, Vice President and General Manager of Nucor Steel Brandenburg. ""Our Elcyon steel plate is another example of Nucor's commitment to sustainability and our focus on providing a differentiated value proposition by making products that no one else is making.""Nucor expects to offer Elcyon in a wide range of plate grades and sizes, working closely with end users to meet their unique needs and specifications.About NucorNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

It is witnessing strong architectural sales volumes, which is driving sales in the Americas Group segment. It saw strong demand in the third quarter of 2022 across all professional architectural markets in the Americas Group.The company, in its third-quarter call, said that it sees the strong positive results to continue into the fourth quarter. This is projected to be driven by sustained momentum in the Americas Group and industrial end markets in North America, continued price realization, good cost control and softer year-over-year comparisons. It expects consolidated net sales to increase high-single to low-double digit percentage year over year in the fourth quarter.Sherwin-Williams’ cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement are also expected to provide margin benefits. It is also implementing pricing actions to offset cost inflation, especially in raw materials.The company also remains committed toward expanding its retail operations. It is focused on capturing a larger share of its end-markets, as is evident from increasing number of retail stores. It added 32 net new stores through the first three quarters of 2022 and expects to add 40-50 new stores in the fourth quarter.Sherwin-Williams also has a strong liquidity position and is using its cash strategically. It generated $1.28 billion in net operating cash during the first nine months of 2022. The company also repurchased 2.75 million shares of its common stock during the period. It had remaining authorization to repurchase 45.8 million shares through open market purchases at the end of the third quarter.Story continuesA Few HeadwindsThe company faces headwinds from higher raw material costs. Raw material inflation on a year-over-year basis had an impact on the company’s performance in the third quarter. The impacts of raw material cost inflation are likely to continue in the fourth quarter. The company sees input cost inflation of high-teens percentage for full-year 2022. Sherwin-Williams is also seeing higher labor and transportation costs. Higher costs may exert pressure on the company’s earnings.Demand has also significantly softened in Europe due to the sluggish macroeconomic environment. Moreover, lack of meaningful recovery in China following the lifting of pandemic-led restrictions is also affecting the company. Demand is expected to remain sluggish in Europe and China in the fourth quarter, affecting the company’s volumes.The SherwinWilliams Company Price and Consensus The SherwinWilliams Company Price and ConsensusThe SherwinWilliams Company price-consensus-chart | The SherwinWilliams Company Quote Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Olympic Steel, Inc.

While this quarter represented a deceleration in revenue growth from earlier this year, much of that was due to hospital staffing shortages and the vagaries of global health-care systems emerging from a myriad of Pandemic disruptions. Earlier this year, the Company received FDA approval for its minimally invasive mitral valve repair system PASCAL. The Company has presented compelling clinical data, which could help support accelerating growth in the next few years.

31,3e0b194e-dac4-3de6-aa86-80f2e943e794,WMT,2023-01-20,10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-value-stocks-big-buybacks-165833448.html,1674147513,STORY,"['UNP', 'SPGI', 'JNJ', 'NVDA', 'WMT']","[In this article, we take a look at 10 value stocks with big buybacks. If you want to see more value stocks with big buybacks, go directly to 5 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks.Value stocks are stocks that arguably trade below their intrinsic value. Although the intrinsic value of a stock is subjective because different people can have different prices on what they think a stock is worth, many investors view the stocks of high quality companies with long term growth potential and reasonable forward P/E ratios as value stocks.Many high quality companies trade for lower valuations at the beginning of 2023 given the uncertain macroeconomic climate of rising interest rates, high inflation, and a potential recession this year.In 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially and the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates even further this year. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be a recession that could put pressure on stocks.Nevertheless, if the macroeconomic climate normalizes, valuations could potentially normalize and help the stock prices of many high quality companies in the long term.Some value companies are also companies with big share buybacks.Companies buy back stock to reduce the number of shares outstanding. If they don't issue new stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding could potentially increase their earnings per share if they are profitable and their profits remain the same or rise. If a company's earnings per share rises substantially, its stock could potentially benefit if its price to earnings valuation remains the same.Share buybacks have the advantage of being more flexible than dividends in terms of their timing. While dividends are usually but not necessarily periodic, share buybacks don't have a set schedule.Share buybacks have historically also been more tax advantageous than dividends.While inflation and interest rates will eventually normalize, 2023 could be a volatile year like 2022. If economic data fails to meet estimates, there could be more downside for both the market and value stocks before macroeconomic conditions normalize. As a result, it could be a good idea to own a diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks, we used preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data for Q3 2022 from the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we selected 10 stocks from the list of top 20 buyback stocks that arguably trade below their long term intrinsic value.We ranked the stocks by the amount of buybacks they did in the third quarter per the preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database which held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks10.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Walmart (WMT).Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.3% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Walmart, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is WMT a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.08.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's the full list, as covered in real time on InvestingPro. Sign up to get this news first.Netflix climbs following Q4 reportNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) said fourth quarter global streaming paid net additions grew 7.66 million, well ahead of its 4.5M estimate, due to both strong acquisition and retention, and driven primarily by the success of its Q4 content slate. EPS came in at $0.12, compared with the consensus estimate of $0.59, while revenue was $7.85B (up 2% year-over-year), just above consensus.For Q1, the company expects revenue of $8.172B (up 4% year-over-year), better than the $8.15B consensus, though expected EPS of $2.82 is lower than the $2.97 average estimate. The company expects to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1, anticipating it to result in a very different quarterly paid net adds pattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2 than in Q1.Netflix also announced that Reed Hastings stepped down as a co-CEO to take on the role of executive chairman. Former COO Greg Peters is now Ted Sarandos' co-CEO and a member of the Netflix board.Shares were recently up more than 5% pre-market.Procter &amp; Gamble sales hit by strong U.S. dollarProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) shares closed down more than 2% after the company said Q2 sales dropped due to the strong U.S. dollar, which it says negatively impacted international demand for the company's consumer goods.Net sales, which take into account foreign exchange and acquisitions, decreased by 1% from a year earlier to $20.8B in Q2. The company, which earns more than half of its revenue from outside the U.S., stated that an ""unfavorable"" foreign exchange environment had a 6% effect on net sales. Still, the number was slightly better than the consensus estimate of $20.74B. Q2 EPS came in at $1.59, compared with the consensus estimate of $1.58.Story continuesThe company raised its fiscal 2023 all-in sales growth guidance to a range of (1%)-0% from the prior (3%)-(1%). The company maintained its 2023 diluted EPS growth guidance in the range of 0-4% versus fiscal 2022 EPS of $5.81.Bad tidings at NordstromNordstrom (NYSE:JWN) was off some 6% in the pre-market after the company said sales dropped 3.5% for the nine-week holiday period ended December 31, 2022, compared with the nine weeks ended January 1, 2022. For the Nordstrom banner chain, net sales decreased 1.7 percent, while net sales at the Nordstrom off-price Rack chain decreased 7.6 percent.Kohl's Corp. (NYSE:KSS) and Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) both lost ground on the news.Rounding out yesterday's earnings newsWeWork Inc. (NYSE:WE) said yesterday it expects to report Q4 revenue above forecast and a narrower fall in EBITDA. It had forecasted revenue in the range of $870-890M and adjusted EBITDA in the range of minus $85-65M. The company also announced it plans to cut approximately 300 jobs in its global workforce. Shares closed down more than 3%.Allstate (NYSE:ALL) shares plunged more than 5% following the company's reported preliminary Q4 results, estimating a net loss of $285-335M, with an adjusted estimated net loss of $335-385M.Unfavorable prior-year reserve estimates totaled $282M, excluding catastrophes. According to BofA Securities, which cut its price target to $148 from $154, this is likely the most disappointing item from the pre-announcement.

This company, which is in the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This global professional services firm providing strategy, risk and people solutions has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.67%.For the most recent quarter, Marsh &amp; McLennan was expected to post earnings of $1.16 per share, but it reported $1.18 per share instead, representing a surprise of 1.72%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.86 per share, while it actually produced $1.89 per share, a surprise of 1.61%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Marsh &amp; McLennan lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesMarsh &amp; McLennan currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.72%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 26, 2023.Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

43,c62eb4bc-c78e-3962-a227-853cd157934d,MMC,2023-01-20,Marsh & McLennan (MMC) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marsh-mclennan-mmc-earnings-expected-150103846.html,1674140463,STORY,['MMC'],"[Marsh &amp; McLennan (MMC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis global professional services firm providing strategy, risk and people solutions is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.9%.Revenues are expected to be $5.23 billion, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.22% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marsh &amp; McLennan?For Marsh &amp; McLennan, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.72%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Marsh &amp; McLennan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marsh &amp; McLennan would post earnings of $1.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.18, delivering a surprise of +1.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

44,0853e195-07eb-3ecf-882c-910032d8e015,XYL,2023-01-20,Xylem (XYL) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xylem-xyl-upgraded-strong-buy-170005736.html,1674147605,STORY,['XYL'],"[Xylem (XYL) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Xylem basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Xylem imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for XylemFor the fiscal year ending December 2022, this water and wastewater treatment company is expected to earn $2.71 per share, which is a change of 8.8% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Xylem. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.5%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Xylem to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It was the lowest since April.“Data releases like this are why policymakers continue to reiterate their intention to raise rates,” Jefferies said.Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Thursday insisted the Fed was “determined to stay the course"" on monetary policy tightening, and would keep rates “sufficiently restrictive for some time"" to ensure inflation returns to the central bank’s 2% target.The remarks from the Fed vice chair on keeping rates higher for longer have added to concerns that the Fed could overtighten policy, tipping the economy into recession.The earnings front, meanwhile, did little to allay those fears about the economy and the consumer.Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) fell more than 4%, leading consumer stocks lower, after the cruise company warned that it expected to report a net loss for the quarter and full year.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also added to downside momentum, falling 1%, as many worry the EV maker’s quarterly results could fall short of expectations amid slowing demand and disruption to productions in China.Banking and insurance stocks, meanwhile, continued to pressure financials, paced by a slump in Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS), Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), and Charles Schwab Corp (NYSE:SCHW).Story continuesNorthern Trust Corporation reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street estimates, sending its share price more than 8% lower.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) share price is 95% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 13% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 56% in the last three years.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Occidental Petroleum went from making a loss to reporting a profit, in the last year.When a company is just on the edge of profitability it can be well worth considering other metrics in order to more precisely gauge growth (and therefore understand share price movements).We doubt the modest 0.8% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. However the year on year revenue growth of 64% would help. We do see some companies suppress earnings in order to accelerate revenue growth.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Occidental Petroleum stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Occidental Petroleum has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 96% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 0.2% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Occidental Petroleum (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Occidental Petroleum is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

The yields have dropped from 3.905% at year-end, and from a 15-year high of 4.338% on Oct. 21.In energy, oil prices rose and registered a second straight weekly gain as China's economic prospects improved.Brent crude settled at $87.63 a barrel, up $1.47, or 1.7%.

This survey provides fresh insights about the participant experience, perceived value and overall benefits of their company’s equity plans.Among the notable findings from the study:The power of equity compensation to recruit and retain talent increased: Participant views about the value of stock plan benefits increased year-over-year, with 45% citing stock plan benefits as a reason they joined their company (up 4% pts.) and 60% as a reason they have stayed (up 2% pts.).Professional guidance is highly sought after: Over two-thirds (67%) of participants said that if their company offered access to financial professionals to help with investing-related questions they would use this benefit, while nearly as many (65%) said they would seize the opportunity to work with a Financial Advisor for comprehensive financial planning if offered through the workplace. In addition, access to financial coaching on topics such as budgeting, credit and debt management ranked third (53%) as a benefit they would be most likely to use.While progress has been made, the majority still do not understand tax implications and other important information. More participants say they understand key topics like how taxes impact stock plan benefits (39%, up from 34%), how to maximize the financial benefit from their stock plan benefits (38%, up from 33%), and how to seek guidance (46%, up from 41%), but the majority still struggle—demonstrating that while education efforts have helped, there is still more work to do.Participants are looking for educational content around equity, retirement and investing. Respondents reported they were somewhat or very likely to attend education sessions on stock plan benefits (70%), retirement (68%), advanced investing (67%), investing (60%) and general financial wellness (57%).Story continues""Amid a continuing tight labor market, it is not surprising that while equity valuations have decreased, the value participants place on equity compensation has increased and remains a competitive workplace benefit to attract and retain top talent and drive employee satisfaction,"" said Scott Whatley, Managing Director and Global Head of Equity Solutions, Morgan Stanley at Work. ""Education and guidance remain key to help both employers and their participants unlock the full potential of their stock plan benefits, as there is no better way to reap the full rewards of your plan than by ensuring the participant population fully understands and embraces it.""Additional findings from the Second Annual Morgan Stanley at Work Stock Plan Participant study are available here.Morgan Stanley at Work launched a new thought leadership podcast called, Invested at Work, covering all things workplace financial benefits.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been disappointing. The share price has failed to impress anyone , down a sizable 66% during that time. So is the recent increase sufficient to restore confidence in the stock? Not yet. But it could be that the fall was overdone.The recent uptick of 3.4% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Callon Petroleum became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.Revenue is actually up 44% over the time period.

After all, there may be an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthCallon Petroleum is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels.

Worse still, the company has lost shareholders 11% per year over five years. It could well be that the business has begun to stabilize, although we'd be hesitant to buy without clear information suggesting the company will grow.

But the all-country equity gauge was also on course to notch up a loss of around 1.5% for the week.Wall Street's benchmark S&amp;P 500 was on track for its worst weekly drop in more than a month, of around 2.5% at Thursday's close. S&amp;P futures traded flat ahead of the market open.Some analysts say equities have been showing too much optimism about an economic improvement, as both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank remain resolute about tightening monetary policy to battle inflation.Europe's STOXX 600 share index, which rose 0.5% on Friday, has during the first three weeks of January, recovered almost half of 2022's 12.9% loss. That bounce has been driven by China reopening trades and easing natural gas prices.""The European market remains unprepared for the wave of pain that is coming from credit conditions tightening,"" Andreas Bruckner, European equity strategist at Bank of America, said.ECB President Christine Lagarde told the World Economic Forum's Davos gathering on Thursday that the bank would stay the course with raising interest rates.The Fed also looks set to sustain its tightening campaign, even after reports on Wednesday showed retail sales, producer prices and production at U.S. factories fell more than expected in December.On Thursday, U.S. weekly jobless claims were also lower than expected, pointing to a tight labour market, which sent the S&amp;P 500 0.8% lower.Boston Fed President Susan Collins said the central bank would probably need to raise rates to ""just above"" 5%, then hold them there, while Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said that despite the recent moderation in inflation, it remains high and ""policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive for some time"".Story continuesGovernment bond markets and riskier assets, such as equities and high-yield credit, had kicked off 2023 driven by ""contradictory"" narratives, Artemis fixed income investment manager Juan Valenzula said.""We've had a monumental rally in government bonds,"" he said, ""based on the idea that the impact of rate hikes makes a recession more likely"".""Risk assets are not reacting in a coherent manner,"" he added. ""They are focusing on a different economic outlook.The 10-year US Treasury yield hit its lowest since mid-September earlier this week, as traders bet downbeat economic data would force the Fed to slow down the pace of its interest-rate hikes.The key 10-year yield added around 4 basis points to 3.435% on Friday but remained far below the high of around 4.3% struck in October. Bond yields fall as prices rise.The dollar index - which measures the U.S. currency against six peers, including the euro and yen - rose 0.3% to 102.34, holding within sight of Wednesday's 7-1/2-month low.The Japanese yen, which has been volatile as traders debate when the Bank of Japan might scrap its controversial policy of buying vast quantities of government bonds to suppress borrowing costs, fell 1.2% to 129.97 per dollar.Elsewhere, crude oil prices continued to rise. Brent futures for March delivery were 30 cents, or 0.35%, higher at $86.46 a barrel, while U.S. crude advanced 49 cents to $80.82 per barrel, a 0.6% gain.(Reporting by Naomi Rovnick and Kevin Buckland; Editing by Sharon Singleton, Kirsten Donovan)]"

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) share price is 95% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 13% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 56% in the last three years.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Occidental Petroleum went from making a loss to reporting a profit, in the last year.When a company is just on the edge of profitability it can be well worth considering other metrics in order to more precisely gauge growth (and therefore understand share price movements).We doubt the modest 0.8% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. However the year on year revenue growth of 64% would help. We do see some companies suppress earnings in order to accelerate revenue growth.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Occidental Petroleum stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Occidental Petroleum has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 96% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 0.2% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Occidental Petroleum (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Occidental Petroleum is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Ralph Lauren grew its EPS by 10% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Ralph Lauren maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 14% to US$6.4b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Ralph Lauren.Are Ralph Lauren Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Ralph Lauren has a market capitalisation of US$7.8b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$2.4b. Coming in at 30% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.Story continuesDoes Ralph Lauren Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Ralph Lauren is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Ralph Lauren (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you need to be mindful of.Although Ralph Lauren certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages.Murdoch, 91, is the most high-profile figure to face questioning in the case.Fox has argued that it had a right to report on election-fraud allegations made by Trump and his lawyers, and that Dominion’s lawsuit would stifle press freedom. Fox referred Reuters to an earlier statement saying: “There is nothing more newsworthy than covering the president of the United States and his lawyers making allegations of voter fraud.""A judge rejected the network’s bid to toss the case in December 2021. ""From the highest levels down, Fox knowingly spread lies about Dominion,"" the election machine company said in a statement.Murdoch is expected to be questioned in person in Los Angeles on Thursday and Friday by lawyers for Dominion, according to a filing in Delaware Superior Court. The session will be closed to the public. Murdoch’s deposition had previously been scheduled for Dec. 13 and Dec. 14, 2022.Dominion has also sought communications from Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox News personnel, as it seeks to prove that the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy. That is the standard of “actual malice” that public figures must prove to prevail in defamation cases.Doug Mirell, a defamation lawyer who has followed the litigation, said he believes Dominion has an ""air-tight"" case for actual malice because Fox hosts pressed forward with vote-rigging allegations ""well after it was quite clear that these claims were demonstrably false.""Dominion alleged in its March 2021 lawsuit that Fox amplified the false theories to boost its ratings and stay abreast of hard-right competitors including One America News Network, which Dominion is also suing. The complaint cited instances in which Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News and falsely claimed Dominion software may have manipulated vote counts in favor of Biden. A five-week trial in the case is scheduled to begin on April 17.The deposition comes as special committees of the boards of directors for Fox Corp and News Corp consider a proposal from Murdoch to re-combine, nearly a decade after the companies split.

MSI, Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. CMTL.Industry: WirelessLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2040564/3-wireless-stocks-set-to-ride-on-5g-rollout-cloud-transitionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry appears well poised to gain from healthy demand trends with the gradual revival in post-pandemic market conditions and a faster 5G rollout. However, large-scale investments to support the 5G transition, margin erosion due to price wars and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and supply chain adversities might erode profitability.Nevertheless, Motorola Solutions, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc. and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. are likely to benefit from the increasing demand for state-of-the-art wireless products with a vast proliferation of IoT, fiber densification and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions.The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Continuous Infrastructure Upgrade: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services.Story continuesMoreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment.Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Profitability Woes Persist: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pricing pressure in early 5G deals.Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and shortages of other raw materials are likely to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to affect the delivery schedule and escalate production costs. High technological obsolescence of most products and a challenging macroeconomic environment have also escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D.Transition to Cloud Networking Solutions: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions.The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

They had fallen 30% in the past 12 months, echoing a 24% slump in the broader tech industry.Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's boss since 2019, said in the memo on Friday that he took ""full responsibility"" for the decisions that led to the layoffs.Pichai, whose pay was recently tied more closely to performance, said this was a moment to ""sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,"" as Alphabet looked to get imbue its products with more AI, echoing comments from Microsoft that announced job cuts on Wednesday.Alphabet, long a leader in AI, is facing competition from Microsoft, which is reportedly looking to boost its stake in ChatGPT - a promising chatbot that answers queries with human-like responses.Advertising dollars, Alphabet's mainstay revenue source, meanwhile, is feeling the squeeze from businesses chopping budgets as consumers pull back spending.""It is clear that Alphabet is not immune from the tough economic backdrop, with worries about a U.S. recession growing,"" said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.""Ad growth has come off the boil ... Competition is also heating up, with Alphabet facing a powerful rival in TikTok, and Instagram also vying for its important YouTube viewers,"" Streeter said, noting that Alphabet has also racked up billions in regulatory fines.Story continuesEvercore ISIS analyst Mark Mahaney said Alphabet's record-high headcount had created major margin risk going into fiscal 2023 and Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said the job cuts could save the company Alphabet $2.5 billion to $3 billion in costs.BIG JOB CUTSWith Alphabet's staff cuts, layoffs at four of the biggest U.S. tech companies total 51,000 jobs in the past few months. They have fanned fears of a recession even as the U.S. job market remains tight.""The tech sector is bit like the proverbial canary in the coal mine,"" said Stuart Cole, an economist at Equiti Capital, who believes the tech layoffs portend that the outlook for job security is finally beginning to turn more negative.Apple, which hired more prudently through the pandemic, has held off on cuts so far. On Friday, though, website AppleInsider reported citing sources that the iPhone maker had started to lay off non-seasonal employees in its retail channel in places such as Best Buy stores.Apple was not immediately available for a comment on the report.'LITTLE COMFORT'Alphabet has been working on a major AI launch, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. One of the sources said it would take place in the spring. The New York Times also reported that Google planned to unveil more than 20 new products and a search engine including chatbot features.Among those losing their jobs are recruiters, corporate staff and people working on engineering and product teams, Pichai said. Google has cut most jobs at Area 120, its in-house incubator for new projects, a company spokesperson told Reuters.The Alphabet Workers Union said in a statement that the company's leadership taking ""full responsibility"" was ""little comfort.""""It's appalling that our jobs are first on the chopping block so shareholders can see a few more points in a chart next quarter,"" the union said.In the United States, where Alphabet has already emailed affected employees, staff would receive severance and six months of healthcare as well as immigration support.Overseas, layoff notifications will take longer due to local employment laws and practices, Pichai said in the memo. Employees in Asia will learn starting in February if the reduction impacts them.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in Davos, Switzerland, Akash Sriram, Deep Vakil, Chavi Mehta, Tiyashi Dutta, Nivedita Balu and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle, Alexander Smith, Nick Zieminski, Sayantani Ghosh)]"

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$445.4mUS$608.9mUS$487.3mUS$422.1mUS$385.1mUS$363.7mUS$351.8mUS$345.8mUS$343.7mUS$344.3mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -19.96%Est @ -13.38%Est @ -8.77%Est @ -5.55%Est @ -3.29%Est @ -1.71%Est @ -0.60%Est @ 0.17% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.0% US$409US$512US$376US$299US$250US$217US$192US$173US$158US$145(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.7bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$344m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.0%– 2.0%) = US$5.0bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.0b÷ ( 1 + 9.0%)10= US$2.1bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.8b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$73.3, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Signet Jewelers as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.169. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Signet JewelersStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

The total number of wage and salary workers grew by 5.3 million, or 3.9%, most of them non-union workers.""This disproportionately large increase in the number of total wage and salary employment compared with the increase in the number of union members led to a decrease in the union membership rate,"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in a statement.The data released Thursday shows that while unionization efforts have come into the limelight, they have not translated into greater representation of the workforce.A surge in union organizing began during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and has included unprecedented efforts to unionize Amazon.com Inc warehouses, Starbucks cafes, Apple Inc retail stores and video game developers.In December, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the agency that enforces U.S. labor laws, made it easier for unions to organize small groups of a company's workforce, a move that was expected to give them a key advantage in campaigns to unionize factories, warehouses, universities and other sprawling workplaces.The data on union membership is collected as part of the Current Population Survey, a monthly survey of about 60,000 eligible households that obtains information on employment and unemployment among the United States' civilian, non-institutional population age 16 and over.(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; editing by Paul Thomasch and Jonathan Oatis)]"

With this, it plans to produce its proprietary oat base at Oatly's facilities in Ogden, Utah, and Fort Worth, Texas. The product will then be transferred to Canadian-based Ya YA Foods to be ""co-packed into Oatly products on-site at each location,"" according to a company press release.It's a big win in Baumgartner's opinion. ""Ya YA coming in as a hybrid manufacturer now allows Oatly to split CapEx (capital expenditure) with a partner, so it really reduces CapEx going forward in 2023 and in the out years. We think you could have a CapEx savings of up to $100 million relative to the base case here in 2023. That significantly reduces cash burn, improves liquidity profile going forward,"" he said.SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 15: Containers of Oatly frozen desserts are displayed on a shelf at a Whole Foods store on November 15, 2021 in San Rafael, California. Oatly reported third quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations with revenues of $171 million compared to expectations of $185.7 million. The company also forecast annual sales of $635 million instead of analyst expectations of $690 million. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)'More consumption opportunities' for Oatly, compared to plant-based meatBaumgartner said COVID-19 prompted an increase in consumption of plant-based drinks.The plant-based beverage category ""has really had a pull forward of demand with the COVID lockdowns in 2020...up 45, 50%,"" he said.According to the market research firm ReportLinker, the global plant-based beverage market is expected reach $48.8 billion by the year 2028, with an annual growth rate of 11.2%.Story continuesBaumgartner also noted that the category has ""many more consumption opportunities"" compared to that of plant-based meat.""You can use it as a milk replacement in cereal. You can drink it as a beverage. You can use it as a coffee creamer. You can use it as an ingredient...you can see four or five consumption opportunities per day.""He said plant-based meats, such as those from Beyond Meat and others, have fewer ""consumption opportunities."" However, he favors the category over a ""10 to 15 year period."" Baumgartner has a Neutral rating on shares of Beyond Meat.Quick-service restaurants also seem to have an easier time adopting plant-based beverages. ""There's also a much larger service component in coffee shops, in Starbucks, supporting the category growth in beverages you haven't yet really tapped into on the plant based meat side,"" he said.And while Wall Street is keeping a close eye on consumer trade-down amid higher prices, the plant-based beverage category doesn't seem to be impacted.""Even with the category raising prices 12%, volume was only down 1%-2%, so in terms of elasticity, plant based beverage is really on par with cow's milk, soft drinks, bottled water. It really proved itself as a real staple category over the past year.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.76%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.76%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 10.92%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the airline had lost 0.82% over the past month. This has lagged the Transportation sector's gain of 3.05% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.18% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Southwest Airlines as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 26, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Southwest Airlines to post earnings of $0.22 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 57.14%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.31 billion, up 24.88% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Southwest Airlines. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 4.15% lower within the past month.

For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.71, which means Southwest Airlines is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that LUV has a PEG ratio of 1.94. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. LUV's industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.9 as of yesterday's close.The Transportation - Airline industry is part of the Transportation sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 50, putting it in the top 20% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Price and EPS Surprise Southwest Airlines Co. Price and EPS SurpriseSouthwest Airlines Co. price-eps-surprise | Southwest Airlines Co. QuoteGiven this backdrop, let's delve deeper to unearth the factors that are likely to have influenced LUV’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance.Southwest Airlines was the worst-affected U.S. airline in terms of flight cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions during the Christmas holiday weekend. LUV had to cancel in excess of 16,700 flights in the Dec 21-Dec 31, 2022, timeframe due to the inclement weather.The mass cancellations are likely to have dented the company's fourth-quarter 2022 performance. Following the massive cancellations, LUV expects available seat miles (a measure of capacity) to decline approximately 6% in fourth-quarter 2022 from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. The previous guidance hinted at a 2% decline in available seat miles for fourth-quarter 2022.Revenues are likely to be adversely impacted by $400-$425 million. Following the massive flight cancellations, management expects a pre-tax hit of $725-$825 million to fourth-quarter earnings.However, LUV’s focus on boosting cargo revenues is likely to have aided its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 cargo revenues hints at an 11.6% sequential increase.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for LUV this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesSouthwest Airlines has an Earnings ESP of -101.96% (the Most Accurate Estimate indicates break even earnings at present, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is presently pegged at 22 cents) and a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q3Southwest Airlines' third-quarter 2022 earnings of 50 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. Moreover, the bottom line improved more than 100% year over year. Revenues of $6,220 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,228.1 million but improved 32.9% year over year on the back of an improvement in leisure demand and close-in bookings in September 2022.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings.JetBlue Airways JBLU has an Earnings ESP of +6.77% and a Zacks Rank #3. JBLU will release results on Jan 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We expect upbeat air-travel demand to have aided JBLU’s fourth-quarter performance.

111,43b85bf4-bc0b-3e95-b9d4-d2509169537f,LUV,2023-01-20,Southwest Airlines (LUV) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-luv-reports-next-150003049.html,1674140403,STORY,['LUV'],"[Southwest Airlines (LUV) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +57.1%.Revenues are expected to be $6.31 billion, up 24.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 23.29% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southwest?For Southwest, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -101.96%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southwest will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Southwest would post earnings of $0.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of +21.95%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Southwest doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe and nearly brought air travel (and all travel for that matter) to a standstill. Air traffic dropped by 96% in the immediate aftermath. As panic ensued and the airlines tried their best to survive, companies like United Airlines were forced to lay off thousands of employees (36,000 in UAL's case). Meanwhile, other airlines were forced to retire planes while institutional investors dumped shares in a hurry.In a rare circumstance, Warren Buffett, who had taken large positions in major carriers including United Airlines, Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines was forced to bite the bullet and absorb massive losses in his positions in May of 2020. How bad was the carnage? In the three months following the COVID-19 news going viral, the U.S. Global Jets ETF, an ETF that tracks a basket of major global airlines, lost two-thirds of its value.Next, airlines were ironically falling short of the number of employees (particularly pilots) necessary to meet rising demand after the initial demand shock and the subsequent bounce. The reason for this was the layoffs that occurred earlier in the year, an aging pilot population looking to retire, and vaccine mandates required by the major U.S. carriers which caused some employees to quit (today only UAL requires COVID-19 vaccines).For a brief period between March 2020 and the first half of 2021, airlines seemed to be back on their feet. Citizens began traveling once again and demand began to claw its way back from the lows. The economy and stock market started clicking as the Federal Reserve kept rates at rock bottom levels and the government hurled billions of dollars in stimulus at ailing businesses. However, the euphoria would not last long. The next obstacle airlines would have to face is sky high fuel costs. After crude oil futures briefly went negative in 2020, they stormed back to more than $130 as demand increased and Russia invaded Ukraine.Story continuesCan the Major Airlines Gain Altitude Again?Several positive pieces of information including fundamentals, technicals, and industry specific news suggest that the worst may be behind the airline stocks. Below are 5 reasons why:1.)         United Airlines Unveils Massive Guidance: Tuesday, after the market close, United Airlines announced earnings of $2.46 a share, handily beating consensus analyst estimates of $2.10. The Chicago-based mega-carrier also smashed revenue estimates and provided eye popping guidance for 2023. United now sees 2023 adjusted EPS to soar to between $10 and $12 per share from just $2.52 in 2022 and heavy losses of -$13.94 in 2021 and -$27.57 in 2020. Guidance of this size underscores immense confidence in the business moving forward.2.)         Technical Picture is Improving: United and other major carriers are displaying drastically improving price action. The ""big 4"" domestic airlines are above their 200-day moving averages, signaled a ""Golden Cross,"" and have crossed above multi-year downtrend lines.3.)         Analysts are Bullish: According to Zack's analyst data, Wall Street seconds UAL's bullishness for the industry. Over the past 60 days, consensus analyst estimates are on the rise.4.)         Air Traffic Data: In recent weeks, TSA data suggests that the number of daily airline travelers is back to pre-pandemic levels.5.)         Strong Industry Ranking: The Zack's Transportation – Airline Industry is currently ranked in the top 20% of all industries tracked. It's worth noting because studies have shown that more than half of a company's performance is attributed to the underlying group.6.)         Boeing is a Bullish Barometer: Shares of airplane manufacturing juggernaut Boeing are taking flight and are up 43.5% in the past six months. The super performance comes as the company turns around its production issues. Boeing is seeing strong momentum in deliveries and easing supply chains. In other words, airlines that are looking to expand their fleet should have no issues.Outlook  The past few weeks have been telling for the airline industry. Top tier airline stocks shook off news that the FAA would need to ground flights several days ago. Recent TSA data and earnings reports point to a major recovery and the possibility that the industry is finally putting the pandemic behind it.With that said, investors are best served to be patient and show restraint for the time being if they are not already in the stocks. Airlines like UAL have moved vertically and are up 35% year-to-date and have made dramatic moves off their 2022 lows. In the coming weeks and months investors should look for these stocks to digest gains and offer low risk entry areas. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

While it’s not the most generous payout, the company also features 60 years of consecutive dividend increases.Fundamentally, Colgate-Palmolive benefits from inelastic demand. Essentially, people should usually aim to brush their teeth three times a day, along with flossing at least once a day. More than likely, a recession won’t change this regimen. Should people skip a dental appointment or two, they’ll still be brushing their teeth.According to analysts, CL rates as a consensus moderate buy. Among 12 experts, five of them rate CL a buy while the rest say hold. Nevertheless, generally rising exposure among hedge funds – even though the immediate sentiment may be negative – could be a good sign moving forward.Story continuesSempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for inflation-fighting stocks to buy, you probably can’t go wrong with public utilities. Undergirding the necessary services that modern societies need, these entities enjoy practically permanent demand. Specifically, Southern California’s Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) may be one of the best ideas for mitigating rising prices.For one thing, Sempra features a forward yield of 2.85%. To be fair, it’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. However, the company enjoys 18 years of annual consecutive dividend increases. And while its payout ratio isn’t low, at almost 48%, it’s certainly not the highest ratio you’ll see. That’s good for sustainability.Secondly, Sempra strongly benefits from geography. Namely, California represents the U.S. economy’s powerhouse, generating a $3.4 trillion GDP. Per the Los Angeles Times, the Golden State might also become the world’s fourth-largest economy. Whether you like it or not, Sempra is here to stay, making it one of the more compelling inflation-fighting stocks.Phillips 66 (PSX)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockWhile the above two enterprises enjoy reliable and dependable demand structures, we’re also talking about mitigating rising prices. In other words, inflation-fighting stocks to buy should feature more robust payouts. Fortunately, energy giant Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) helps deliver such passive income. At time of writing, the company carries a forward yield of 3.77%.To be sure, critics might point out that this payout slips lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. As well, the company only has two years of consecutive dividend increases. Still, Phillips 66 deserves consideration as one of the inflation-fighting stocks in part because of its payout ratio. At 31.23%, it’s a low and therefore credible metric.Fundamentally, Phillips 66 should benefit from social normalization trends, particularly in the workplace. As major corporations put an end to remote work for all five business days of the week, commuting volume will rise. That should be very helpful for PSX, where the underlying firm specializes in the downstream (refining and marketing) component of the energy value chain.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVAlthough IBM (NYSE:IBM) plies its trade in the exciting technology sector, Big Blue itself isn’t very interesting. For longer than it probably cares to admit, the company held onto legacy businesses that suffered from fading relevancies. Still, with key strategic shifts and acquisitions, IBM now represents a quiet outperformer. For instance, in the trailing year, shares gained almost 10% of equity value.Regarding the topic of inflation-fighting stocks, IBM currently carries a forward yield of 4.52%. This metric ranks well above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the company enjoys 29 years of consecutive dividend increases. While its payout ratio rings a little warm at 66.1%, it’s not the hottest stat ever.Plus, IBM enjoys significant relevancies. Yes, we may be hurtling toward a global recession. But that’s not going to stop tech firms from innovating. Along with its artificial intelligence unit, IBM commands significant relevancies with its enterprise-level cybersecurity services. Therefore, Big Blue will probably make good as one of the inflation-fighting stocks to buy.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comWith Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), this company represents an example of not shooting the messenger. Understandably, some folks may take issue with the company as it makes up the ranks of global big tobacco. At the same time, I write for a broad audience. Therefore, it’s not my right to presume the sensibilities of everyone. Even those who may have hesitancies with PM will find it difficult to ignore the passive income. Currently, Philip Morris features a forward yield of 5%. Again, the consumer staple sector’s average yield sits at 1.89%. As well, PM enjoys 14 years of dividend increases, a trend I’m sure management will want to sustain.Regarding the fundamentals, globally, smoking prevalence declined, which doesn’t seem to support Philip Morris. However, many people still do enjoy their adult liberties and they’re choosing e-cigarettes or vaporizers. Philip Morris invested in this relatively new platform, making it an intriguing (though controversial) idea among inflation-fighting stocks.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockTo be fully transparent, if you want a more conservative approach with your inflation-fighting stocks, you should consider some of the names above. With Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the narrative admittedly becomes incredibly tricky. For one thing, you’re looking at a rather steep market loss, shedding almost 22% in the trailing year.From another angle, the company arguably deserves the fallout. In large part due to Verizon’s aggressive marketing initiatives in 2021, the volatility of the following year hurt VZ stock. As a result, Verizon encountered analyst criticism and pessimism.Though distracting, it’s also fair to point out that investors hard hit with rising prices might give the telecom giant another look. That’s because Verizon offers a forward yield of 6.24%. Notably, the communication sector’s average yield sits at a comparatively low 2.62%. Moreover, Verizon enjoys 18 years of consecutive dividend increases. On a final note, the company currently enjoys a moderate buy consensus view. Therefore, if you want to take a shot, you won’t be the only one.BHP (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockIf you really want to take your inflation-fighting stocks to the next level, then you may want to consider metals and mining firm BHP (NYSE:BHP). For starters, the Australian stalwart represented one of the few winners of 2022. And in the trailing year, BHP gained nearly 17% of equity value. Indeed, near-term sentiment rates strongly, with shares soaring almost 41% in the past half-year period.Fundamentally, geopolitical flashpoints crimped global supplies of critical resources. Therefore, western-friendly countries such as Australia will play a more vital role in international commerce. Specific to BHP, the company specializes in many critical resources, such as copper and nickel. Both feature heavily in advanced solutions such as electric vehicles.Of course, probably the biggest reason why some investors may look to BHP as one of the inflation-fighting stocks to buy is the payout. Commanding a forward yield of 10.1%, stakeholders could be getting passive income superior to some stocks’ annual market returns. However, the downside is that the payout ratio stands at a stratospheric 127.2%. Still, because of increased fundamental relevance, BHP remains intriguing.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The van TVI was 5.9% higher than in December 2020 and was the second-highest December on record.At 167, the refrigerated (""reefer"") TVI was 4.0% lower month over month and down 1.2% year over year. The flatbed TVI fell 11.8% compared to November but was 3.2% higher year over year.""There was a peak season for truckload freight; it just arrived later than usual and with many of the variables you’d expect in December, from winter storms to a rush of retail sales boosted by last-minute deals for holiday shoppers,"" said Ken Adamo, DAT Chief of Analytics. ""To borrow a football term, sometimes you have to let the play develop and not count out a season or freight cycle.""Spot van, reefer rates jumpedSpot truckload freight rates ended the year on a higher note, and line-haul rates increased substantially:The national average spot van and reefer rate rose 3 cents from November to $2.41 per mile and $2.82 per mile, respectively. The average flatbed rate was $2.77 per mile, 3 cents lower than the November average.The national average line-haul rate for van freight jumped 12 cents to $1.83 a mile, the highest since September. The reefer line-haul rate increased 13 cents to $2.19 a mile and the line-haul flatbed rate averaged $2.08 a mile, up 8 cents month over month.Line-haul rates remained well below December 2022, when they averaged $2.60 a mile for van freight, $3.04 a mile for reefers and $2.60 a mile for flatbeds.Story continuesLoad-to-truck ratios increasedDAT load-to-truck ratios reflected stronger demand for truckload services:The national average van load-to-truck ratio rose from 2.7 to 3.4, meaning there were 3.4 loads for every van posted to the DAT One network last month.The reefer ratio averaged 5.7, up from 4.9 in November, and the flatbed ratio was 9.8, up from 9.3.Gap between contract and spot rates narrowedWhile spot rates increased, rates declined for freight moving under longer-term contracts.The average shipper-to-broker van rate slipped 8 cents in December to $2.96 a mile, unchanged compared to December 2021. The average contract reefer rate was $3.24 a mile, down 12 cents and 15 cents higher year over year, and the average flatbed rate fell 13 cents to $3.53 a mile, 19 cents higher year over year.The gap between spot and contract rates narrowed during December to 55 cents for vans, 42 cents for reefers and 76 cents for flatbeds.""December showed that seasonality is coming back to truckload freight,"" Adamo said. ""In your 2023 playbook, expect a slow January and February for spot freight volumes, which is consistent with previous years—at least, years that don’t include a Polar Vortex or pandemic.""About the DAT Truckload Volume IndexThe DAT Truckload Volume Index reflects the change in the number of loads with a pickup date during that month; the actual index number is normalized each month to accommodate any new data sources without distortion. A baseline of 100 equals the number of loads moved in January 2015, as recorded in DAT RateView, a truckload pricing database and analysis tool with rates paid on an average of 3 million loads per month.Spot truckload rates are negotiated for each load and paid to the carrier by a freight broker. National average spot rates are derived from payments to carriers by freight brokers, third-party logistics providers and other transportation buyers for hauls of 250 miles or more with a pickup date during the month reported. DAT’s rate analysis is based on $137 billion in annualized freight transactions.Spot rates are ""all-in"" rates and do not include a separate fuel surcharge. Line-haul rates subtract an amount equal to an average fuel surcharge.About DAT Freight &amp; AnalyticsDAT Freight &amp; Analytics operates the largest truckload freight marketplace in North America. Shippers, transportation brokers, carriers, news organizations and industry analysts rely on DAT for market trends and data insights based on more than 500 million freight matches and a database of $137 billion in annual market transactions.Founded in 1978, DAT is a wholly owned subsidiary of Roper Technologies (NYSE:ROP), a diversified technology company and constituent of the S&amp;P 500 and Fortune 500 indices.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230119005855/en/ContactsAnnabel ReevesCorporate Communications, DAT Freight &amp; AnalyticsAnnabel.Reeves@dat.com; 503-501-0143]"

After the stock price dropped 3.5% last week, the company's market value declined by US$1.3b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group TransDigm Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Raymond Laubenthal, sold US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$670 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$660. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). Raymond Laubenthal was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like TransDigm Group better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that TransDigm Group insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$308m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At TransDigm Group Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of TransDigm Group, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.76%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 10.92%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the shopping mall real estate investment trust had gained 4.89% over the past month. This has lagged the Finance sector's gain of 5.9% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.18% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Simon Property as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 6, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Simon Property to post earnings of $3.14 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 1.62%.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this paint and coatings maker would post earnings of $1.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.66, delivering a surprise of -0.60%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.PPG Industries , which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, posted revenues of $4.19 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.18%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.19 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PPG Industries shares have added about 1.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.3%.What's Next for PPG Industries?While PPG Industries has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

This earnings improvement was driven by aggregate selling price increases that totaled 19% on a two-year stacked basis, as we remained focused on mitigating the significant cumulative cost inflation incurred the past two years.Overall sales volumes declined 5% year over year as manufacturing activity slowed in most regions, including Asia Pacific where volumes were down a low double-digit percentage primarily due to the pandemic-related impacts in China. As anticipated, demand remained soft in global architectural do-it-yourself (DIY) coatings. In Europe, aggregate industrial activity weakened sequentially, and sales volumes were down a mid-single-digit percentage; however, our quarterly operating earnings in that region were consistent with prior-year levels, driven by strong price realization and cost management. We delivered record net sales in our automotive refinish and PPG Comex coatings businesses reflecting our leading products and strong commercial relationships. Global aerospace demand continued to recover leading to strong year-over-year organic sales growth of about 20%, even though certain supply chain challenges remained.Story continuesLooking ahead, we remain highly focused on building further momentum to restore margins in line with our historical profile. In the first quarter, we will continue to prioritize supporting our customers through superior service and products, executing our cost-savings initiatives, and optimizing inventory. We expect the overall demand environment to remain consistent sequentially with the fourth quarter with soft economic activity remaining in Europe and China. However, as the year progresses, we anticipate several positive catalysts that will enable earnings improvement, including certain PPG commercial initiatives with our valued customers and the continued rebound in demand for our technology-advantaged aerospace products. Other catalysts include moderating raw material costs, coatings demand stabilization in Europe beginning in the second quarter, and strong economic recovery in China as the pandemic reopening progresses. Finally, with fewer supply chain disruptions we expect ample commodity raw material availability and improved manufacturing efficiencies.Lastly, I am looking forward to leading PPG in my new role and want to thank our customers for selecting PPG as their supplier of choice, our shareholders for their confidence, and our global employees who demonstrate The PPG Way by making it happen every day.Fourth Quarter 2022 Reportable Segment Financial ResultsPerformance Coatings segment$ in millions4Q 20224Q 2021Y-O-Y changeNet sales$2,490$2,507-1%Segment income$272$243+12%Segment income %10.9%9.7%Sales volumes-4%Selling prices+9%Divestitures and wind down of Russia-1%Foreign currency translation-5%Performance Coatings net sales were down slightly versus the prior-year fourth quarter as lower sales volumes, the impact of divestitures, the wind down of business in Russia, and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts were nearly all offset by selling price increases in all businesses.Excluding Asia, broad supply chain disruptions continued to moderate during the quarter, with the most significant remaining challenges impacting the aerospace coatings business. As expected, demand for architectural coatings DIY products in Europe remained soft due to customer inventory destocking and lower consumer confidence stemming from current geopolitical issues. While softer DIY demand drove lower sales volumes in the U.S. architectural coatings business, several new business wins will aid growth in future quarters. PPG Comex delivered another strong quarter and finished with over 5,100 concessionaire locations, up about 3% from last year. Automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a low double-digit percentage driven by higher selling prices and sales volumes, despite significant impacts to demand in China due to pandemic-related disruptions. Aerospace coatings sales volumes remained robust and order backlogs remained at historic highs as supply chain disruptions continued. Traffic solutions organic sales were flat in the seasonally low fourth quarter. Organic sales in the protective and marine coatings business declined by a low single-digit percentage, primarily due to pandemic-related disruptions in China.Segment income increased by 12% versus the prior year primarily due to higher selling prices and restructuring cost savings which more than offset cost inflation, the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and increased manufacturing costs. Segment operating margins improved by 120 basis points year over year.Industrial Coatings segment$ in millions4Q 20224Q 2021Y-O-Y changeNet sales$1,695$1,683+1%Segment income$155$105+48%Segment income %9.1%6.2%Sales volumes-5%Selling prices+13%Divestitures and wind down of Russia-1%Foreign currency translation-6%Industrial Coatings net sales increased modestly as higher selling prices across all businesses were partially offset by lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and the wind down of business in Russia.Automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) coatings organic sales were up a low double-digit percentage due to higher global selling prices coupled with increased year-over-year sales volumes in Europe. Global automotive OEM industry production continued to be impacted by certain customer production outages due to component shortages and pandemic-related disruptions in China, both of which are expected to improve in 2023. Industrial coatings organic sales were up a mid-single-digit percentage driven by strong selling price realization, partially offset by lower sales volumes in Europe and China due to softer industrial production activity. Packaging coatings delivered mid-single-digit percentage organic sales growth led by higher selling prices, which were offset by lower sales volumes in most regions.Segment income was higher than the prior year by $50 million mainly due to higher selling prices and restructuring cost savings, partially offset by lower sales volumes, increased raw material and energy costs, and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Segment margins improved by 290 basis points compared to the fourth quarter 2021.Additional Financial InformationAt year end, the company had cash and short-term investments totaling nearly $1.2 billion. Net debt was $5.7 billion, which was comparable to the prior year end. Inventories were higher year over year but declined sequentially in comparison to the third quarter 2022 due to destocking initiatives that are expected to continue into 2023.Corporate expenses were $52 million in the fourth quarter, including lower incentive compensation expense year over year.Acquisition-related synergies and business restructuring programs delivered about $20 million of cost savings in the quarter.The company’s reported and adjusted effective tax rates for the fourth quarter 2022 were both about 23%, compared to 2021 reported and adjusted rates of 1% and 5%, respectively. The fourth quarter 2021 reported and adjusted earnings per diluted share were both impacted by the lower tax rates that included favorable discrete items that did not recur in the fourth quarter of 2022.Full-Year 2022 Financial Results$ in millions, except EPS20222021Y-O-Y changeNet sales*$17,652$16,802+5%Net income†$1,028$1,420-28%Adjusted net income†**$1,436$1,619-11%EPS†$4.33$5.93-27%Adjusted EPS†**$6.05$6.77-11%*Components of year-over-year net sales change: higher selling prices (+11%), lower sales volumes (-3%), acquisition-related sales (+3%), unfavorable foreign currency translation (-5%); divestiture-related sales and the wind down of Russia operations (-1%)**Detailed reconciliations of the reported to the adjusted figures are included below†From continuing operationsFull-year 2022 reported net sales from continuing operations were approximately $17.7 billion, up about 5% versus the prior year. Organic sales were higher by 8% driven by higher selling prices. Net income in 2022 decreased versus 2021 due to raw material cost inflation, lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign-currency translation, and higher manufacturing costs related to supply and labor disruptions, partially offset by higher selling prices, restructuring cost savings and acquisition-related synergies.In 2022, the company paid $570 million in dividends. Capital expenditures totaled about $520 million, which was higher than the prior year due to more normalized spending. The company had about $1 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization at the end of 2022.OutlookThe company today reported the following projections for the first quarter 2023 based on current global economic activity and in consideration of the near-term economic uncertainty associated with the impacts of geopolitical issues in Europe and the continuing pandemic, especially in China:Aggregate sales volumes down a mid-single-digit percentage year over yearCorporate expenses of between $90 million and $95 million; higher than prior year, partially due to increasing pension costs (non-cash) and prior-year adjustments to incentive compensation that are not expected to recurNet interest expense of between $38 million and $40 millionEffective tax rate of 22% to 24%Reported EPS of $0.95 to $1.05Adjusted EPS of $1.10 to $1.20, excluding amortization expense of $0.13 and costs related to previously approved and communicated business restructuring of $0.02.The higher corporate and interest expenses are projected to decrease reported and adjusted EPS by about $0.20 on a year-over-year basis.A detailed commentary and associated presentation slides related to the fourth quarter financial information is posted on the company’s investor relations website.The term organic sales as used in this press release is defined as net sales excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions, divestitures, and the wind down of Russia operations.PPG: WE PROTECT AND BEAUTIFY THE WORLD®At PPG (NYSE:PPG), we work every day to develop and deliver the paints, coatings and specialty materials that our customers have trusted for 140 years.

These matters within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, involve risks and uncertainties that may affect PPG’s operations, as discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein. Such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of COVID-19, global economic conditions, geopolitical issues in Europe, the amount of future share repurchases, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, energy, labor and logistics, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, PPG inventory levels, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring and other initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of potential future and completed acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and governmental investigations. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or earnings, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.All information in this release speaks only as of January 19, 2023, and any distribution of this release after that date is not intended and will not be construed as updating or confirming such information. PPG undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as otherwise required by applicable law.Regulation G ReconciliationPPG believes investors’ understanding of the company’s performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and PPG’s effective tax rate adjusted for certain items. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and the effective tax rate adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""U.S. GAAP"") and should not be considered a substitute for net income, earnings per diluted share, the effective tax rate or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and the adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.Regulation G Reconciliation - Net Income and Earnings per Diluted Share($ in millions, except per-share amounts)Fourth Quarter2022Fourth Quarter2021$EPS(a)$EPS(a)Reported net income from continuing operations$238$1.01$267$1.12Acquisition-related amortization expense310.13350.15Impairment and other related charges, net(b)110.05——Business restructuring-related costs, net(c)60.03500.21Pension settlement charge——360.15Environmental remediation charges——70.03Transaction-related costs, net(d)——40.02Asbestos-related claims reserve adjustment(e)——(101)(0.42)Adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items$286$1.22$298$1.26Full Year2022Full Year2021$EPS(a)$EPS(a)Reported net income from continuing operations$1,028$4.33$1,420$5.93Impairment and other related charges, net(b)2140.90120.05Acquisition-related amortization expense1260.531300.55Business restructuring-related costs, net(c)560.24200.08Transaction-related costs, net(d)120.05690.29Pension settlement charge——360.15Environmental remediation charges——260.11Net tax charge related to UK statutory rate change——220.09Expenses incurred due to natural disasters(f)——130.06Decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts related to COVID-19——(11)(0.05)Income from legal settlements——(17)(0.07)Asbestos-related claims reserve adjustment(e)——(101)(0.42)Adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items$1,436$6.05$1,619$6.77Fourth Quarter2022Fourth Quarter2021IncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesIncomeTaxExpenseEffectiveTax RateIncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesIncomeTaxExpenseEffectiveTax RateEffective tax rate, continuing operations$319$7322.9%$282$41.4%Acquisition-related amortization expense411024.4%461124.8%Impairment and other related charges, net(b)15424.7%———%Business restructuring-related costs, net(c)8229.7%671725.3%Pension settlement charge———%501426.6%Environmental remediation charges———%9224.3%Transaction-related costs, net(d)———%5122.3%Asbestos-related claims reserve adjustment(e)———%(133)(32)24.3%Adjusted effective tax rate, continuing operations, excluding certain items$383$8923.2%$326$175.2%Full Year2022Full Year2021IncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesIncomeTaxExpenseEffectiveTax RateIncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesIncomeTaxExpenseEffectiveTax RateEffective tax rate, continuing operations$1,381$32523.5%$1,815$37420.6%Impairment and other related charges, net(b)2453112.7%21629.2%Acquisition-related amortization expense1664024.1%1724224.4%Business restructuring-related costs, net(c)751925.3%27725.9%Transaction-related costs, net(d)10(2)(20.0)%861719.8%Pension settlement charge———%501426.6%Environmental remediation charges———%35924.3%Net tax charge related to UK statutory rate change———%—(22)N/AExpenses incurred due to natural disasters(f)———%17424.3%Decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts related to COVID-19———%(14)(3)24.7%Income from legal settlements———%(22)(5)24.3%Asbestos-related claims reserve adjustment(e)———%(133)(32)24.3%Adjusted effective tax rate, continuing operations, excluding certain items$1,877$41322.0%$2,054$41120.0%(a)Earnings per diluted share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.

Revenue grew across all Divisions and geographical areas, with robust year-end sales in digital and particularly strong service activity offshore and in the Middle East where we witnessed a significant inflection as capacity expansion projects mobilized.Story continues""Sequentially, fourth-quarter revenue grew 5%; EPS, excluding charges and credits, expanded to $0.71; and adjusted EBITDA margins grew to 24.4%—219 basis points (bps) higher than the same quarter last year—exceeding our target exit rate. More importantly, fourth-quarter pretax segment operating margins and EPS were the highest since 2015, reflecting our enhanced earnings power and potential as activity growth momentum is sustained through the next few years.An Outstanding Year of Success with Significant Tailwinds""We concluded the year with 23% growth in revenue; 70% growth in EPS, excluding charges and credits; adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 152 bps; cash flow from operations of $3.7 billion; and 13% ROCE, its highest level since 2014.""Overall, 2022 was transformative for SLB as we set new safety, operational, and performance benchmarks for our customers and strengthened our market position both internationally and in North America. We launched our bold new brand identity, reinforcing our leadership position in energy technology, digital, and sustainability, and demonstrated our ability to deliver superior earnings in this early phase of a structural upcycle in energy.""In North America, we seized the growth cycle throughout the year, increased our pretax operating margins close to 600 bps, and almost doubled our pretax operating income. We effectively harnessed our refocused portfolio, fit-for-basin technology, and performance differentiation to gain greater market access and improved pricing, particularly in the drilling markets where we significantly outperformed rig count growth. Today, we have built one of the highest-quality oilfield services and equipment businesses in North America through the implementation of our returns-focused strategy.""In the international markets, after a first half of the year that was impacted by geopolitical conflict and supply chain bottlenecks, activity began to visibly inflect in the second half of the year, resulting in full year revenue growth of 20% and margin expansion of more than 150 bps. We laid the foundation for further growth and margin expansion through pricing improvements and a solid pipeline of incremental contract awards. In the Middle East, SLB is well positioned to be a key beneficiary of this visible market expansion, and we expect record levels of upstream investment by NOCs to continue in the next few years. During the year, we secured a sizeable share of tender awards in the region, driven by our differentiated performance, fit-for-purpose technology, and best-in-class local content. Similarly, across offshore basins, we continue to consolidate our advantaged position with new contract awards, particularly in Latin America and Africa.""In this context, our investments in capex and inventory increased as we exited the year in support of new international and offshore project mobilizations. These factors, combined with lower-than-expected year-end collections, resulted in free cash flow reducing to $0.9 billion for the fourth quarter. Despite these effects, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter by reducing both net and gross debt.""Beyond our financial results, we made significant progress in our sustainability initiatives during the year. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions intensity and launched several new Transition Technologies* to support the decarbonization of oil and gas. Our Transition Technologies portfolio revenue grew more than 30% year on year, and we project it will cross the $1 billion revenue mark in 2023.""Finally, we initiated increased returns to shareholders, demonstrating confidence in our strategy, our financial outperformance, and our commitment to superior returns. We increased our dividend by 40% in April 2022, followed by a further 43% increase today, and we resumed our share buyback program this month.""I am extremely proud of our full-year results, and I would like to extend my thanks to the entire team for their outstanding performance.""Primed for Strong Growth and Returns—A Distinctive New Phase in the UpcycleLe Peuch said, ""The fourth quarter affirmed a distinctive new phase in the upcycle. In the Middle East, revenue increased by double digits sequentially, with growth in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates in the solid teens, affirming the much-anticipated acceleration of activity in the region. Offshore activity continued to strengthen, partially offset by seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere. In North America, US land rig count remains at robust levels, although the pace of growth is moderating. Additionally, pricing continues to trend favorably, extending beyond North America and into the international regions, supported by new technology and very tight equipment and service capacity in certain markets.""These activity dynamics, improved pricing, and our commercial success—particularly in the Middle East, offshore, and North American markets—combine to set a very strong foundation for outperformance in 2023.""Looking ahead, we believe the macro backdrop and market fundamentals that underpin a strong multi-year upcycle for energy remain very compelling in oil and gas and in low-carbon energy resources. First, oil and gas demand is forecast by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to grow by 1.9 million barrels per day in 2023 despite concerns for a potential economic slowdown in certain regions. In parallel, markets remain very tightly supplied. Second, energy security is prompting a sense of urgency to make further investments to ensure capacity expansion and diversity of supply. And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate with significant digital technology advancements, favorable government policy support, and increased spending on low-carbon initiatives and resources.""Based on these factors, global upstream spending projections continue to trend positively. Activity growth is expected to be broad-based, marked by an acceleration in international basins. These positive activity dynamics will be amplified by higher service pricing and tighter service sector capacity. The impact of loosening COVID-19 restrictions and an earlier than expected reopening of China could support further upside potential over 2023.""Overall, the combination of these effects will result in a very favorable mix for SLB with significant growth opportunities in our Core, Digital, and New Energy. We expect another year of very strong growth and margin expansion. We have a clear strategy, an advantaged portfolio, and the right team in place to drive our business forward. I look forward to another successful year for our customers and our shareholders.""Other EventsOn October 26, 2022, SLB announced it entered into an agreement to acquire Gyrodata Incorporated, a global company specializing in gyroscopic wellbore positioning and survey technology. The acquisition will integrate Gyrodata’s wellbore placement and surveying technologies within SLB’s Well Construction business, to bring customers innovative drilling solutions. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.In December 2022, SLB repurchased $804 million of its outstanding notes, consisting of $395 million of 3.75% Senior Notes due 2024 and $409 million of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025.On January 19, 2023, SLB’s Board of Directors approved a 43% increase in SLB’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.175 per share of outstanding common stock to $0.25 per share, beginning with the dividend payable on April 6, 2023, to stockholders of record on February 8, 2023.Fourth-Quarter Revenue by Geographical Area(Stated in millions)Three Months EndedChangeDec. 31,2022Sept. 30,2022Dec. 31,2021SequentialYear-on-yearNorth America$1,633$1,543$1,2816%27%Latin America1,6191,5081,2047%34%Europe/CIS/Africa2,0672,0391,5871%30%Middle East &amp; Asia2,5082,3342,1077%19%Eliminations &amp; other525346n/mn/m$7,879$7,477$6,2255%27%  International$6,194$5,881$4,8985%26%North America$1,633$1,543$1,2816%27% n/m = not meaningfulInternationalRevenue in Latin America of $1.6 billion increased 7% sequentially due to higher Well Construction revenue from increased drilling activity and improved pricing, mainly in Mexico and Brazil.

The scope of work encompasses 14 services from across all four of SLB’s Divisions, with the objective of improving efficiency in the intervention and workover space, thereby boosting production from the block.Oil &amp; Gas Decarbonization, New Technology, and PerformanceSLB continues to develop and deploy innovative technologies that lower operational emissions and environmental impact in reservoir evaluation, well construction, production, and integrated operations for customers globally. Customer adoption of SLB technology is accelerating and continues to significantly impact performance leading to more efficient operations, lower carbon emissions, and higher returns for our customers. Notable highlights include:In the US’ Midland Basin, Pioneer Natural Resources successfully deployed novel SLB cement-free slurry technology on an 18-well field testing campaign. This pilot in North America resulted in the complete elimination of Portland cement from slurry designs, offering a unique opportunity for the oilfield industry to substantially decrease CO2 emissions related to well construction. In addition to aligning with Pioneer’s objective to lead in environmental stewardship through proactive measures, the field trials validated the ability of the technology to fit within standard oilfield cementing workflows without major changes to the design process, onsite execution, or post-job evaluation. This innovative SLB solution will be available to customers later this year to help lower oilfield operations emissions and achieve net-zero objectives.The SLB fit-for-basin frac plug portfolio achieved significant global market adoption milestones. The FracXion Micro* fully composite frac plugs eclipsed 100,000 installations. The full portfolio of ReacXion* fully dissolvable frac plugs, an SLB footprint-reducing technology, achieved 50,000 installations and lowered operators’ CO2e emissions by reducing diesel consumption by an estimated 5.7 million liters. These technologies represent how SLB creates new opportunities by understanding customer needs to amplify our sustainability impact and reduce our customers' cost to operate.In Saudi Arabia, during November 2022 and working in collaboration with Saudi Aramco Unconventional Resources, SLB’s integrated fracturing services team exceeded previous SLB records for stages and pumping hours per month by 19%. This was achieved through applying latest technologies, best field practices, and close collaboration between Saudi Aramco and SLB. This level of efficiency rivals that of the most efficient fracturing crews in North America. Additionally, real-time job visibility and digitalization of SLB maintenance operations increased asset efficiency and reliability while reducing carbon footprint.Offshore Norway, the Well Intervention and Stimulation Alliance comprising Aker BP, StimWell Services, and SLB conducted the world's first successful wireline and slickline autonomous operations. These are examples of the SLB Neuro* autonomous solutions, which offer enhanced technologies for improved well economics with repeatability, reliability, and reduced carbon.

The system will support early pipeline leak detection workflows and deliver accurate virtual flow metering solutions in a challenging technical and regulatory environment. The Johan Sverdrup field is an offshore oil discovery located in the Norwegian Continental Shelf and at plateau the field will produce 720,000 barrels of oil per day.Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) Innovation &amp; Technology Group, Information Management Team, collaborated with SLB to build an integrated digital workflow using the DELFI cognitive E&amp;P environment to continuously monitor water production in a producing oil field, enabling KOC to avoid potential oil losses of 465,000 barrels. Conventional approaches were unable to detect changes in water cut quickly, preventing KOC engineers from taking timely action to avoid oil losses. A solution was implemented using DELFI Data Science, a package of AI and analytics solutions for energy workflows that includes embedded technology from Dataiku, the platform for everyday AI. The solution provides automated water cut estimation and prediction that is 5,400 times faster than the conventional method. This enables data-driven decision making to minimize oil loss with a few simple clicks that yield results in seconds. Based on the success of this project, KOC recommended full implementation of this solution.NEW ENERGYSLB’s domain expertise and experience in technology industrialization is helping to lead the energy transition. We continue to work with partners across various industries to innovate clean energy solutions for a balanced planet.SLB and Linde entered into a strategic collaboration on carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) projects to accelerate decarbonization solutions across industrial and energy sectors. The collaboration will combine decades of experience in CO2 capture and sequestration; innovative technology portfolios; project development and execution expertise; and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) capabilities. CO2 is found or produced in many industrial and energy applications. This collaboration will focus on hydrogen and ammonia production, where CO2 is a by-product, and on natural gas processing. CCUS abates the emissions from these energy-intensive industries, creating new low-carbon energy sources and products. Using SLB and Linde’s global footprint across multiple sectors and industries, the collaboration will expand customer reach and will focus on designing business and operating models that maximize value for all stakeholders.Genvia, the clean hydrogen technology venture of SLB, France’s CEA, and partners, was selected by the European Commission as part of the Important Project of Common European Interest in the hydrogen technology program (IPCEI-Hy2Tech). Genvia will receive up to 200 million euros from the French Government’s France 2030 fund as part of the program. The grant will be used to accelerate the time to market of Genvia high-performance electrolyzer technology.SLB is collaborating with Oman’s Ministry of Energy and Minerals and the Oman Investment Authority in building a national strategy to develop the potential of Oman’s geothermal resources. This follows the completion of an extensive project to evaluate data from more than 7,000 oil, gas, and water wells, with the objective of mapping sweet spots for geothermal prospects in the country. The next phase will include assessment of the economic feasibility of the development of potential geothermal resources. This collaboration between the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, Oman Investment Authority, and SLB is in line with Oman’s efforts to decarbonize the energy sector, achieve its net zero goal, and implement Oman Vision 2040.Celsius Energy, a venture of SLB’s New Energy business focused on heating and cooling solutions for buildings, was awarded a contract for one of the 10 largest geoenergy projects in Europe, where demand for low-carbon and locally sourced energy is rising. This project, based in the eastern region of France, will provide heating and cooling to dozens of buildings by combining geoenergy and waste heat from the world’s largest particle accelerator. Celsius Energy’s proprietary technology will enable the project to be completed with a limited drilling footprint of 174 bores and will leverage patented digital modeling and control capability for smart grid performance optimization.FINANCIAL TABLESFull-Year Results(Stated in millions, except per share amounts)Twelve Months EndedDec. 31, 2022Dec. 31, 2021ChangeRevenue$28,091$22,92923%Income before taxes - GAAP basis$4,271$2,37480%Income before taxes margin - GAAP basis15.2%10.4%485 bpsNet income attributable to SLB - GAAP basis$3,441$1,88183%Diluted EPS - GAAP basis$2.39$1.3281% Adjusted EBITDA*$6,462$4,92531%Adjusted EBITDA margin*23.0%21.5%152 bpsPretax segment operating income*$5,011$3,36549%Pretax segment operating margin*17.8%14.7%316 bpsNet income attributable to SLB, excluding charges &amp; credits*$3,138$1,83171%Diluted EPS, excluding charges &amp; credits*$2.18$1.2870% Revenue by Geography International$21,895$18,29520%North America5,9954,46634%Other201168n/m$28,091$22,92923% *These are non-GAAP financial measures.

Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations.Charges &amp; CreditsIn addition to financial results determined in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under the SEC’s Regulation G).

Management believes that the exclusion of charges &amp; credits from these financial measures enables it to evaluate more effectively SLB’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by the excluded items.

Various Fed speakers have indicated their willingness to continue raising rates but at a slower pace, while others, notably St. Louis Fed Chair James Bullard, have said the Fed should get rates above 5% sooner rather than later.The Fed's next meeting starts Jan. 31, and investors expect that when its decision comes out the next day, it will raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point. That means if it wants to reach above 5%, it's going to have to raise rates at future meetings. The current fed funds rate is 4.25% to 4.50%.The expectation for further rate hikes comes amid corporate earnings season. Banks have already reported, and many noted they put more money aside for possible loan losses down the road as a weaker economy and the potential for rising unemployment put added stress on households.The tech sector will release a smattering of reports in the coming days amid a big wave of layoffs and cost retrenchments in the industry, and then retailers will report after them.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Existing home salesExisting home sales data are due out at 10:00 ET (15:00 GMT). Analysts expect sales to fall 5.4% in December from the prior month, when sales fell 7.7%. On an annual basis, analysts expect existing home sales of 3.96 million, down from 4.09M in November.2. Fed speakersTwo more Fed officials are slated to speak on Friday. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker is slated to speak at 9:00 ET, while Fed Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled to speak at 13:00 ET. Investors will be watching to see if they drop any hints about their thinking coming into the February rate decision.3.

Also, the bottom line declined 14% year over year.Shares of NTRS fell almost 4% in pre-market trading on lower-than-expected results. A full-day trading session will depict a clearer picture.Results were adversely impacted by a rising expense base, worsening credit quality, lower fee income and weak capital ratios. Yet, a rise in net interest income (NII) driven by higher rates acted as a tailwind.After considering non-recurring items, net income was $155.7 million, down 62% year over year.In 2022, earnings were $6.14 per share, down 14% from the prior year. Net income also declined 14% to $1.34 billion.Revenues Down, Costs RiseQuarterly total revenues of $1.51 billion were down 9% year over year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 billion.In 2022, total revenues grew 5% to $6.76 billion. The top line lagged the consensus estimate of $7.01 billion.NII was $534.5 million in the fourth quarter, gaining 48% year over year, mainly due to a higher net interest margin (NIM). NIM was 1.58%, increasing from 0.96% in the prior-year quarter.Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $1.04 billion, down 6%. Other non-interest loss was $57.6 million against other non-interest income of $195.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Non-interest expenses increased 13% to $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter. The upswing stemmed from an elevation in all components except employee benefits costs.AUM and AUC FallAs of Dec 31, 2022, Northern Trust’s total assets under custody (AUC) declined 16% year over year to $10.6 trillion, while total assets under management (AUM) fell 22% to $1.25 trillion.Credit Quality DeterioratesThe total allowance for credit losses was $200.9 million, increasing 9% year over year.NTRS created provisions for credit losses of $5 million in the fourth quarter against reserve releases of $11.5 million in the prior-year quarter.Total non-accrual assets plunged 62% to $76.4 million as of Dec 31, 2022.Story continuesCapital &amp; Profitability Ratios WeakUnder the Standardized Approach, as of Dec 31, 2022, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, the total capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage ratio were 10.8%, 13.9% and 7.1% compared with 11.9%, 12.9% and 6.9%, respectively, in the prior-year quarter.Return on average assets was 0.42%, down from 1% in the year-ago quarter. Also, the return on average common equity was 5.9% compared with the year-earlier quarter’s 14.5%.Capital Deployment ActivitiesIn the quarter, Northern Trust returned $158.9 million to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.Our ViewpointNorthern Trust’s fourth-quarter performance was affected by a decline in AUC and AUM. Better revenues on rising NII will continue. However, escalating expenses and any decline in fee income might threaten NTRS’ profitability in the upcoming quarters.Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNorthern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNorthern Trust Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteCurrently, Northern Trust carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the bottom line declined 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.Results have been supported by a rise in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. FRC’s capital position was decent in the quarter. Yet, higher expenses and elevated provision for credit losses were the offsetting factors.Wells Fargo’s WFC fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 67 cents outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Results included several non-recurring items like the $3.3 billion or 70 cents per share of operating losses related to “litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters.”Results benefited from higher NII, rising rates and solid average loan growth. Yet, dismal non-interest income, higher provisions and weakness in the mortgage business were the major undermining factors for WFC. Also, the rise in non-interest expenses acted as a headwind.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

This compares to earnings of $1.91 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -8.84%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.80, delivering a surprise of -1.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Northern Trust Corporation , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, posted revenues of $1.52 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.79%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.67 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Northern Trust Corporation shares have added about 11.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.3%.What's Next for Northern Trust Corporation?While Northern Trust Corporation has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

At the same time, the Dow lost 0.76%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 10.92%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the medical device maker had gained 4.64% over the past month. This has outpaced the Medical sector's loss of 0.24% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.18% in that time.Hologic will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 1, 2023.

Play These Top 5 Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/search-earnings-beat-play-top-122512196.html,1674131112,STORY,['HOLX'],"[It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.Yum China YUMC, Impinj PI, Five Below FIVE, Hologic HOLX and Progyny PGNY are likely to beat earnings this season.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project the earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks That Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to six.Here are five out of the six stocks:Yum China YUMC: Yum China’s U.S. operations are based in Texas. The company operates both company-owned and franchised restaurants. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of YUMC for the past four quarters is 263.39%.Impinj PI: The Zacks Rank #2 company is a provider of referral and information network radio frequency identification solutions to the retail, pharmaceutical, healthcare, food and beverage, and other industries.The average earnings surprise of PI for the past four quarters is 697.22%.Five Below FIVE: The Zacks Rank #2 company is a specialty value chain retailer that provides a wide range of premium quality and trendy merchandise for $5 or below.The average earnings surprise of FIVE for the past four quarters is 26.34%.Hologic HOLX: The Zacks Rank #2 company develops, manufactures, and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products which cater to the healthcare needs of women.The average earnings surprise of HOLX for the past four quarters is 46.08%.Progyny PGNY: This is a Zacks Rank #1 company that engages in fertility benefits management.

State Street and Schlumberger are among the firms reporting later on Friday.The corporate news was less benign in cryptoland.The lending unit of crypto firm Genesis on Thursday filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection from creditors, toppled by a market rout along with the likes of exchange FTX and lender BlockFi. Genesis' lending unit said it had both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion, and estimated it had over 100,000 creditors in its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.In wider markets, a dour Thursday showed some retreat of the early year optimism on peaking central bank interest rates.Federal Reserve officials have been resolute all week in insisting policy rates will go above 5% this year from the current 4.25-4.50% range and won't come down until 2024.Markets still doubt them and futures markets only nudged their implied 'terminal rate' up to 4.9% overnight while still pricing almost half a percentage point of cuts in the second half of the year.Story continuesThe latest U.S. weekly jobless claims show the labour market is still way too tight for many Fed policymakers to consider taking their foot off the brake, with real wage growth now turning positive once again after about 18 months in the red.Central bankers in Europe have also doubled down on their hawkish policy message this week, with European Central Bank officials pushing back against reports it was set to slow the pace of its rate hikes next month.Only the Bank of Japan has offered some relief on that score this week as it retained its super-easy stance and formal cap on government borrowing rates for now at least.There were bigger concerns about the looming battle over the U.S. debt ceiling. The U.S. government hit its $31.4 trillion borrowing limit on Thursday, amid a standoff between the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and President Joe Biden's Democrats on lifting the ceiling, which could lead to a fiscal crisis in a few months.With many investors likely to avoid short-term debt instruments and related cash-management vehicles until the issue is resolved, the starkest reflection of the concern this week has been the biggest inversion in the 3-month-to-10-year yield curve in 40 years.Elsewhere, world stocks were steadier to higher on Friday. Chinese stocks gained ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays next week, as strong foreign inflows boosted sentiment after the country said the worst was over in its battle against COVID-19.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* Canada Nov retail sales* Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker both speak* U.S. corporate earnings: State Street, Schlumberger, Huntington Bancshares, Regions Financial(By Mike Dolan; Editing by Toby Chopra)]"

Consumer Price Index may seemingly bode well for costs-of-living dynamics, inflation-fighting stocks to buy is still a good idea. For one thing, it’s probably not wise to make wholesale strategy changes based on a month’s worth of data. Second, the money supply expanded dramatically, meaning much work needs to be done for containment. Therefore, investors shouldn’t give up on inflation-fighting stocks to buy.Moving forward, it’s anyone’s guess what will happen this year. Indeed, with so many wild events erupting in the last three years, few experts will want to stick their neck out. That’s why dividend-paying companies enjoy significant relevance right now, including these inflation-fighting stocks.CLColgate-Palmolive$77.85SRESempra Energy$160.83PSXPhillips 66$103.03IBMIBM.$145.89PMPhilip Morris$101.70VZVerizon$41.86BHPBHP GroupInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsColgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comAs a candidate for inflation-fighting stocks to buy, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) makes sense. The personal care giant carries a forward yield of 2.41%, beating out the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. While it’s not the most generous payout, the company also features 60 years of consecutive dividend increases.Fundamentally, Colgate-Palmolive benefits from inelastic demand. Essentially, people should usually aim to brush their teeth three times a day, along with flossing at least once a day. More than likely, a recession won’t change this regimen. Should people skip a dental appointment or two, they’ll still be brushing their teeth.According to analysts, CL rates as a consensus moderate buy. Among 12 experts, five of them rate CL a buy while the rest say hold. Nevertheless, generally rising exposure among hedge funds – even though the immediate sentiment may be negative – could be a good sign moving forward.Story continuesSempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for inflation-fighting stocks to buy, you probably can’t go wrong with public utilities. Undergirding the necessary services that modern societies need, these entities enjoy practically permanent demand. Specifically, Southern California’s Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) may be one of the best ideas for mitigating rising prices.For one thing, Sempra features a forward yield of 2.85%. To be fair, it’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. However, the company enjoys 18 years of annual consecutive dividend increases. And while its payout ratio isn’t low, at almost 48%, it’s certainly not the highest ratio you’ll see. That’s good for sustainability.Secondly, Sempra strongly benefits from geography. Namely, California represents the U.S. economy’s powerhouse, generating a $3.4 trillion GDP. Per the Los Angeles Times, the Golden State might also become the world’s fourth-largest economy. Whether you like it or not, Sempra is here to stay, making it one of the more compelling inflation-fighting stocks.Phillips 66 (PSX)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockWhile the above two enterprises enjoy reliable and dependable demand structures, we’re also talking about mitigating rising prices. In other words, inflation-fighting stocks to buy should feature more robust payouts. Fortunately, energy giant Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) helps deliver such passive income. At time of writing, the company carries a forward yield of 3.77%.To be sure, critics might point out that this payout slips lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. As well, the company only has two years of consecutive dividend increases. Still, Phillips 66 deserves consideration as one of the inflation-fighting stocks in part because of its payout ratio. At 31.23%, it’s a low and therefore credible metric.Fundamentally, Phillips 66 should benefit from social normalization trends, particularly in the workplace. As major corporations put an end to remote work for all five business days of the week, commuting volume will rise. That should be very helpful for PSX, where the underlying firm specializes in the downstream (refining and marketing) component of the energy value chain.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVAlthough IBM (NYSE:IBM) plies its trade in the exciting technology sector, Big Blue itself isn’t very interesting. For longer than it probably cares to admit, the company held onto legacy businesses that suffered from fading relevancies. Still, with key strategic shifts and acquisitions, IBM now represents a quiet outperformer. For instance, in the trailing year, shares gained almost 10% of equity value.Regarding the topic of inflation-fighting stocks, IBM currently carries a forward yield of 4.52%. This metric ranks well above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the company enjoys 29 years of consecutive dividend increases. While its payout ratio rings a little warm at 66.1%, it’s not the hottest stat ever.Plus, IBM enjoys significant relevancies. Yes, we may be hurtling toward a global recession. But that’s not going to stop tech firms from innovating. Along with its artificial intelligence unit, IBM commands significant relevancies with its enterprise-level cybersecurity services. Therefore, Big Blue will probably make good as one of the inflation-fighting stocks to buy.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comWith Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), this company represents an example of not shooting the messenger. Understandably, some folks may take issue with the company as it makes up the ranks of global big tobacco. At the same time, I write for a broad audience. Therefore, it’s not my right to presume the sensibilities of everyone. Even those who may have hesitancies with PM will find it difficult to ignore the passive income. Currently, Philip Morris features a forward yield of 5%. Again, the consumer staple sector’s average yield sits at 1.89%. As well, PM enjoys 14 years of dividend increases, a trend I’m sure management will want to sustain.Regarding the fundamentals, globally, smoking prevalence declined, which doesn’t seem to support Philip Morris. However, many people still do enjoy their adult liberties and they’re choosing e-cigarettes or vaporizers. Philip Morris invested in this relatively new platform, making it an intriguing (though controversial) idea among inflation-fighting stocks.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockTo be fully transparent, if you want a more conservative approach with your inflation-fighting stocks, you should consider some of the names above. With Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the narrative admittedly becomes incredibly tricky. For one thing, you’re looking at a rather steep market loss, shedding almost 22% in the trailing year.From another angle, the company arguably deserves the fallout. In large part due to Verizon’s aggressive marketing initiatives in 2021, the volatility of the following year hurt VZ stock. As a result, Verizon encountered analyst criticism and pessimism.Though distracting, it’s also fair to point out that investors hard hit with rising prices might give the telecom giant another look. That’s because Verizon offers a forward yield of 6.24%. Notably, the communication sector’s average yield sits at a comparatively low 2.62%. Moreover, Verizon enjoys 18 years of consecutive dividend increases. On a final note, the company currently enjoys a moderate buy consensus view. Therefore, if you want to take a shot, you won’t be the only one.BHP (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockIf you really want to take your inflation-fighting stocks to the next level, then you may want to consider metals and mining firm BHP (NYSE:BHP). For starters, the Australian stalwart represented one of the few winners of 2022. And in the trailing year, BHP gained nearly 17% of equity value. Indeed, near-term sentiment rates strongly, with shares soaring almost 41% in the past half-year period.Fundamentally, geopolitical flashpoints crimped global supplies of critical resources. Therefore, western-friendly countries such as Australia will play a more vital role in international commerce. Specific to BHP, the company specializes in many critical resources, such as copper and nickel. Both feature heavily in advanced solutions such as electric vehicles.Of course, probably the biggest reason why some investors may look to BHP as one of the inflation-fighting stocks to buy is the payout. Commanding a forward yield of 10.1%, stakeholders could be getting passive income superior to some stocks’ annual market returns. However, the downside is that the payout ratio stands at a stratospheric 127.2%. Still, because of increased fundamental relevance, BHP remains intriguing.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Codelco did not respond to a request for comment.Global copper prices have also risen, on expectations that Chinese demand is poised to surge after the country - which consumes half the world's copper - abandoned harsh COVID 19-related lockdowns and restrictions that hamstrung economic activity.Fitch Solutions expects China's copper consumption to rise 4.4% this year, after just 1.5% growth in 2022.Anti-pandemic restrictions had also prolonged smelter maintenance and curtailed copper production growth last year, especially in the Guangdong area.Analysts warn that the global copper market may have got ahead of itself, however, with lingering concerns about how fast and how far Chinese growth may recover, while inside China the surge in domestic premiums has raised concerns.""This is the highest in at least the past five years, and the elevated premium will definitely put lots of pressure on our profits, given we're unlikely to source from anywhere else,"" said a Guangdong-based copper tube producer, who asked not to be identified to speak frankly about business conditions.Graphic: China refined copper spot premium/discount https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-COPPER/MAIKE/mopakjbzmpa/chart.pngThe premium paid by copper users in Guangdong province for domestic copper surged in the third quarter of last year to 349 yuan ($51.74) a tonne over the futures price, from just 91 yuan in the prior quarter, and eased only slightly to 327 yuan in the fourth quarter, according to SMM.For annual supply contracts as well, Guangdong smelters hiked their premium to nearly 250 yuan a tonne for this year, up from 130 yuan a tonne in 2022, a mid-sized Chinese copper buyer said.A similar pattern was seen in the industrial east, despite government subsidies from the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to encourage copper imports.Some smelters there have hiked their offers for 2023 copper premiums to 300 yuan a tonne, up from 200 yuan a tonne last year, a Shanghai-based trader said.While Maike's disappearance from the import market has been blamed for disrupting supplies and pricing, China's refined copper imports increased 6.6% in 2022, according to customs data.Domestic inventories of readily available metal, however, fell last year, according to SMM, and traders believe a significant volume of imports in the second half may have ended up in state reserves. The State Reserve Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.Maike said in a statement to Reuters that it is restructuring the company and would soon resume its business. The company has said that it was also seeking support from the local government and financial institutions.($1 = 6.7450 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Siyi Liu and Dominique Patton; Editing by Edmund Klamann)]"

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.John J. Ray III, who previously handled Enron’s restructuring, said that despite the accusations of criminal misconduct against former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives, customers have lauded FTX's technology and said it could be worth reviving the exchange.“Everything is on the table,” Ray told the Journal. “If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.”The FTX token FTT rose 33% on Binance on the news.The decision would come down to whether restarting FTX's international exchange would recover more for customers than just liquidating assets or selling the platform, Ray said.In the interview, Ray also criticized Bankman-Fried's comments to the media and elsewhere as being unhelpful.

Her comments mirrored similar commitments from other Fed officials this week.But markets remained uncertain over where U.S. interest rates would peak, given that Fed officials offered differing takes on the level, ranging from just below 5% to close to 6%.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,930.90 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,932.35 an ounce by 19:40 ET (00:40 GMT). Both instruments were trading close to their highest level since April 2022, and were set to add about 0.6% this week.Gold prices have been on a tear since data showed a sustained downturn in U.S. inflation, which is likely to invite less hawkish moves by the Fed this year. The prospect of smaller rate hikes brings much relief to bullion prices, which were rattled by a hawkish Fed in 2022.The prospect of a global recession also boosted safe haven demand for gold in recent weeks, amid multiple warnings that major economies could see a contraction this year.Among industrial metals, copper prices retreated in early Asian trade, but were also headed for a fifth straight week of gains amid continued optimism over an economic recovery in China.High-grade copper futures fell 0.2% to $4.2408 a pound, but were up 0.6% this week.Story continuesThe red metal has rallied sharply in recent weeks on growing bets of an economic recovery in China, after the world’s largest copper importer began scaling back most anti-COVID measures in December.Still, recent gains in the red metal were held back by growing fears of a recession this year.Related ArticlesGold prices cool after strong rally, head for fifth week of gainsThousands march on Peru's capital as unrest spreads, building set ablazeOil prices climb on hopes for Fed slowing interest rate hikes]"

The strong growth in revenues across most of its business segments is likely to positively impact its fourth-quarter results.Aerospace Unit to Boost the Overall Top LineSteadily recovering global air travel demand is likely to have contributed to General Dynamics’ Aerospace business unit sales performance, mainly due to the increased demand for maintenance work and activity at its fixed-base operator facilities. Improved aircraft deliveries may also have added impetus to its third-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace segment’s revenues in the fourth quarter is pegged at $2,620 million, indicating a 2.3% improvement from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Dynamics Corporation price-eps-surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteMarine Systems to Contribute UnfavorablyMarine Systems’ Q4 revenues are likely to have been positively impacted by construction and repair volume for ships. However, insufficient lead yard services for submarine programs might have had some adverse impact on this segment’s overall performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Marine segment’s revenues in the fourth quarter is pegged at $2,804 million, indicating a 2.3% decrease from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Positive Combat Systems SalesIncreased revenues from Stryker wheeled combat vehicles and Abrams battle tanks are expected to have contributed to the fourth-quarter revenues of Combat Systems.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Combat Systems segment’s revenues in the fourth quarter is pegged at $1,934 million, indicating a 2.5% improvement from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesTechnologies Unit RevenuesStrong order activity and a pipeline, buoyed by the government's initiative to continue to modernize and upgrade mission support systems, are likely to have benefited the Technologies segment’s sales performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, consistent supply-chain shortages might have had some adverse impact on the overall performance of this segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Technologies segment’s revenues in the fourth quarter is pegged at $3,372 million, indicating 13.3% growth from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Other Factors to NoteThe impressive sales performance across all its segments makes us optimistic about GD’s overall top line in the third quarter. This, in turn, is likely to have aided the bottom line of the company in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, headwinds like shortage of chips, inflation, labor shortage and customer contracting delays may have partially impacted its overall results.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.73 billion, suggesting growth of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.16 per share, indicating growth of 4.7% from the prior-year reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for General Dynamics this time.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.NRG Energy has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while CenterPoint Energy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that NRG has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.NRG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.35, while CNP has a forward P/E of 20.40. We also note that NRG has a PEG ratio of 0.53. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CNP currently has a PEG ratio of 5.79.Another notable valuation metric for NRG is its P/B ratio of 1.45. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CNP has a P/B of 2.08.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NRG's Value grade of A and CNP's Value grade of C.Story continuesNRG is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

168,36d72e65-436b-3600-9cc8-c6f9a9837cbf,NRG,2023-01-20,5 Lucrative GARP Stocks With Discounted PEG,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-lucrative-garp-stocks-discounted-124912496.html,1674132552,STORY,"['TECK-B.TO', 'NRG', 'TECK', 'SAP']","[A pure-play value investor often misses the chance to bet on stocks that have bright long-term prospects. In the same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks. Going by Warren Buffett, these two approaches are joined at the hip.Accordingly, some investors sought to join the bridge between value and growth with a hybrid strategy of investment. Their theory suggests that to make a long-term investment more effective, the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined.GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investment, often known as a special case of value investment, is gaining popularity. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).Several stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, show an overwhelming success of this hybrid investing strategy over pure-play value and growth investments. Here we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These include Conagra Brands CAG, Teck Resources TECK, SAP SE SAP, Deutsche Bank AG DB and NRG Energy NRG.A Few More Words on GARPOne of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is the price/earnings growth ratio (PEG). Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with the future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps to identify stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.However, the question that often arises is whether the market has an adequate number of companies that are growing earnings while trading at reasonable valuations? Going by a CFA Institute Blog by Nicolas Rabener, “on average, 38% of all stocks exhibit a PEG ratio below 1, which is more than enough for security selection.”Story continuesUnfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations in calculating the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purposes)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $800 Million (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.Here are the five out of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Conagra Brands: Chicago-based Conagra Brands is one of the leading branded food companies of North America. The company offers premium edible products, with a refined focus on innovation. Conagra Brands maintains a highly dynamic product portfolio and incorporates alterations within it per the preference pattern of the end-users. Some iconic brands of Conagra Brands are Reddi-Wip, Hunt's, Healthy Choice, Frontera, Slim Jim, Blake's and Marie Callender.Conagra Brands is an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of B. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, Conagra Brands also has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 7%.Teck Resources: Vancouver, Canada-based Teck Resources Limited is a diversified resource company committed to mining and mineral development with business units focused on steelmaking coal, copper, zinc and energy. Teck Resources' principal products include steelmaking coal; copper concentrates and refined copper cathodes; refined zinc and zinc concentrates; energy products, such as bitumen; and lead concentrates. It also produces molybdenum, gold, silver, germanium, indium, mercury, and cadmium, as well as chemicals, industrial products, and fertilizers.

If you want to see more value stocks with big buybacks, go directly to 5 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks.Value stocks are stocks that arguably trade below their intrinsic value. Although the intrinsic value of a stock is subjective because different people can have different prices on what they think a stock is worth, many investors view the stocks of high quality companies with long term growth potential and reasonable forward P/E ratios as value stocks.Many high quality companies trade for lower valuations at the beginning of 2023 given the uncertain macroeconomic climate of rising interest rates, high inflation, and a potential recession this year.In 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially and the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates even further this year. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be a recession that could put pressure on stocks.Nevertheless, if the macroeconomic climate normalizes, valuations could potentially normalize and help the stock prices of many high quality companies in the long term.Some value companies are also companies with big share buybacks.Companies buy back stock to reduce the number of shares outstanding. If they don't issue new stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding could potentially increase their earnings per share if they are profitable and their profits remain the same or rise. If a company's earnings per share rises substantially, its stock could potentially benefit if its price to earnings valuation remains the same.Share buybacks have the advantage of being more flexible than dividends in terms of their timing. While dividends are usually but not necessarily periodic, share buybacks don't have a set schedule.Share buybacks have historically also been more tax advantageous than dividends.While inflation and interest rates will eventually normalize, 2023 could be a volatile year like 2022. If economic data fails to meet estimates, there could be more downside for both the market and value stocks before macroeconomic conditions normalize. As a result, it could be a good idea to own a diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks, we used preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data for Q3 2022 from the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we selected 10 stocks from the list of top 20 buyback stocks that arguably trade below their long term intrinsic value.We ranked the stocks by the amount of buybacks they did in the third quarter per the preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database which held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks10. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $2,024Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is one of the United States' largest railroads that operates from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways. Given railroads take a lot of time and capital to construct, the industry is an oligopoly with only a few firms.Although the macroeconomic climate has been challenging, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has nevertheless affirmed pricing gains in excess of inflation dollars for 2022. The company also reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.19 per share for Q3 2022 with adjusted operating income up 13%. In the third quarter, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) bought back over $2 billion worth of shares, ranking among the top 20 among S&amp;P 500 companies which did buybacks in the period. For 2022, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) sees full share repurchases of $6.5 billion.If the company grows earnings and the macroeconomic climate normalizes, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)'s current valuation could be attractive long term given the forward P/E ratio of 17.7.Alongside Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a stock arguably trading below its intrinsic value that has bought back a substantial amount of shares in Q3.9. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $2,165Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a healthcare giant that bought back more than $2.1 billion worth of shares in Q3. In September of last year, the company's board also authorized repurchases of up to $5 billion worth of the company's common stock.For the third quarter, the company's sales rose 1.9% year over year to $23.8 billion with adjusted operation growth of 8.2%. Adjusted EPS decreased by 1.9% year over year to $2.55.Given healthcare is a huge market and the company has substantial competitive advantages, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has earnings growth potential in the long term. With a forward P/E ratio of 16.37, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares are pretty fairly priced and could rebound when the macroeconomic climate rebounds in the long term.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 85 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).8. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $2,512Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a financial services giant that offers ratings, benchmarks, analytics, data to capital markets globally. Given the growth in the overall financial market over the long term, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)'s business has also grown over time.If it maintains its market share, it is likely S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) will increase its earnings per share further in the long term. In terms of the future, analysts expect earnings growth despite the macroeconomic headwinds. In terms of the consensus, analysts expect the company to earn $11.13 per share in 2022, $12.54 per share in 2023, and $14.55 per share in 2024.Given S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) bought back over $2.5 billion worth of shares in Q3, the company ranks #8 on our list of 10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks.7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $2,961Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Although a forward P/E ratio of 21.57 isn't particularly cheap, Walmart Inc.

It also gained significant contributions from all sales platforms. The results benefited from increased interest and fees on loans. However, the results were partially offset by steep expenses and decreased average active accounts.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.12 suggests a 24.3% decrease from the prior-year figure of $1.48. The consensus mark remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $4 billion indicates a 5.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure while our estimate suggests 2.6% year-over-year growth.Synchrony beat the consensus estimate for earnings in all the prior four quarters, with the average being 7.3%. This is depicted in the graph below:Synchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial price-eps-surprise | Synchrony Financial QuoteFactors to NoteSynchrony Financial is expected to have benefited from a better purchase volume in the fourth quarter as the economy is growing and people are spending more. Our estimate for total purchase volumes for the quarter under review indicates an improvement of 11.6% year over year.SYF is expected to have consistently gained from digital sales volume in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate suggest that the average active accounts in the Home &amp; Auto platform are expected to have risen 2.9% year over year in the fourth quarter.The financial service provider is expected to have witnessed an increase in Average Interest-Earnings Assets. The consensus estimate indicates a 7.5% increase in the metric from the year-ago period while our estimate suggests a 6% jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the efficiency ratio is pegged at 36.78%, suggesting a decline from the prior-year reported figure of 41.10%.Story continuesWhile the above-mentioned factors are likely to have benefited the company in the fourth quarter, some elements are likely to offset the positives, leading to an earnings miss and year-over-year decline. The company is expected to have incurred increased employee costs and information processing expenses in the fourth quarter.Increased expenses are expected to have reduced the margins in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the net interest margin is pegged at 15.4%, down from 15.8% a year ago. The net charge-offs are also expected to have increased in the quarter in review.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Synchrony this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -10.60%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $1.00 per share, much lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Synchrony currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Synchrony, here are some companies from the broader finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Axos Financial, Inc.

Codelco did not respond to a request for comment.Global copper prices have also risen, on expectations that Chinese demand is poised to surge after the country - which consumes half the world's copper - abandoned harsh COVID 19-related lockdowns and restrictions that hamstrung economic activity.Fitch Solutions expects China's copper consumption to rise 4.4% this year, after just 1.5% growth in 2022.Anti-pandemic restrictions had also prolonged smelter maintenance and curtailed copper production growth last year, especially in the Guangdong area.Analysts warn that the global copper market may have got ahead of itself, however, with lingering concerns about how fast and how far Chinese growth may recover, while inside China the surge in domestic premiums has raised concerns.""This is the highest in at least the past five years, and the elevated premium will definitely put lots of pressure on our profits, given we're unlikely to source from anywhere else,"" said a Guangdong-based copper tube producer, who asked not to be identified to speak frankly about business conditions.Graphic: China refined copper spot premium/discount https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-COPPER/MAIKE/mopakjbzmpa/chart.pngThe premium paid by copper users in Guangdong province for domestic copper surged in the third quarter of last year to 349 yuan ($51.74) a tonne over the futures price, from just 91 yuan in the prior quarter, and eased only slightly to 327 yuan in the fourth quarter, according to SMM.For annual supply contracts as well, Guangdong smelters hiked their premium to nearly 250 yuan a tonne for this year, up from 130 yuan a tonne in 2022, a mid-sized Chinese copper buyer said.A similar pattern was seen in the industrial east, despite government subsidies from the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to encourage copper imports.Some smelters there have hiked their offers for 2023 copper premiums to 300 yuan a tonne, up from 200 yuan a tonne last year, a Shanghai-based trader said.While Maike's disappearance from the import market has been blamed for disrupting supplies and pricing, China's refined copper imports increased 6.6% in 2022, according to customs data.Domestic inventories of readily available metal, however, fell last year, according to SMM, and traders believe a significant volume of imports in the second half may have ended up in state reserves. The State Reserve Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.Maike said in a statement to Reuters that it is restructuring the company and would soon resume its business. The company has said that it was also seeking support from the local government and financial institutions.($1 = 6.7450 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Siyi Liu and Dominique Patton; Editing by Edmund Klamann)]"

BTC regained ground it lost when it dipped the previous day. Ether was recently trading up 0.6% to $1,550. Both BTC and ETH have risen 13% and 7%, respectively, over the past seven days.Equities closed down as traders’ recession fears continued to loom over markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.9%, while both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were down 0.7%. The recent risk revival in traditional markets and cryptocurrencies may not be sustained because the U.S. Federal Reserve is still fighting inflation, according to crypto options trading firm QCP Capital in a Thursday note.Story continuesGemini USD (GUSD): Decentralized-finance giant MakerDAO’s community voted to keep the Gemini USD stablecoin as part of its reserve system for its DAI stablecoin.

GUSD is a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by the troubled crypto exchange Gemini.

If you want to see more value stocks with big buybacks, go directly to 5 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks.Value stocks are stocks that arguably trade below their intrinsic value. Although the intrinsic value of a stock is subjective because different people can have different prices on what they think a stock is worth, many investors view the stocks of high quality companies with long term growth potential and reasonable forward P/E ratios as value stocks.Many high quality companies trade for lower valuations at the beginning of 2023 given the uncertain macroeconomic climate of rising interest rates, high inflation, and a potential recession this year.In 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially and the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates even further this year. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be a recession that could put pressure on stocks.Nevertheless, if the macroeconomic climate normalizes, valuations could potentially normalize and help the stock prices of many high quality companies in the long term.Some value companies are also companies with big share buybacks.Companies buy back stock to reduce the number of shares outstanding. If they don't issue new stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding could potentially increase their earnings per share if they are profitable and their profits remain the same or rise. If a company's earnings per share rises substantially, its stock could potentially benefit if its price to earnings valuation remains the same.Share buybacks have the advantage of being more flexible than dividends in terms of their timing. While dividends are usually but not necessarily periodic, share buybacks don't have a set schedule.Share buybacks have historically also been more tax advantageous than dividends.While inflation and interest rates will eventually normalize, 2023 could be a volatile year like 2022. If economic data fails to meet estimates, there could be more downside for both the market and value stocks before macroeconomic conditions normalize. As a result, it could be a good idea to own a diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks, we used preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data for Q3 2022 from the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we selected 10 stocks from the list of top 20 buyback stocks that arguably trade below their long term intrinsic value.We ranked the stocks by the amount of buybacks they did in the third quarter per the preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database which held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks10.

However, by the time the shots became more widely available, the take-up on the continent was slow, as many were less afraid of the virus and misinformation about vaccines had spread.Africa's efforts to expand its own vaccine production capacity were led by South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare.The firm was initially contracted by Johnson &amp; Johnson to package the American firm's COVID-19 vaccine drug substance into final doses and supply it back to J&amp;J. Last March that deal was extended to sell the J&amp;J shot under Aspen's own brand in Africa.But the South African company's expectations of high demand in Africa did not materialise. By August, it had not received a single order for the COVID vaccine and its J&amp;J orders under its previous contract were also ""dwindling"", putting at risk its 450-million-dose vaccine production line.Story continuesIn August, however, a deal was reached to put Aspen's near-idle COVID-19 vaccine production lines to use: a pact was signed with the Serum Institute of India to make and sell four Aspen-branded vaccines for Africa.Last month, CEPI and the Gates Foundation invested $30 million in Aspen to support the agreement between the African vaccine maker and the Serum Institute.""I think the system that we had in 2020 produced the only outcome that it could produce,"" Hatchett said, referring to the unequal distribution of COVID vaccines to the detriment of much of the developing world.""And if we want to change outcomes in the future, we need to change the system. And one of the most important changes...is to support efforts in Africa and elsewhere to increase their vaccine self sufficiency.""

Addressing health equity is critical because more than half the world's population lacks access to essential healthcare. And the most challenging health issues disproportionately impact marginalized populations. But we recognize that no one solution or organization can achieve health equity alone; strategic partnerships are essential to accelerating this critical work.To maximize its commitment to health equity, Medtronic is joining the Global Health Equity Network (GHEN). GHEN is a World Economic Forum initiative that brings the private and public sectors together to drive change in health equity - mobilizing CEOs and business leaders to prioritize action in organizational strategy and purpose.As part of the GHEN agenda, Medtronic has signed the Zero Health Gaps Pledge, which provides 10 areas where committed organizations agree to help drive progress within health equity across their workforce, their companies, and in their communities by 2050.""At Medtronic, we know implementing people-first technology through access-enabling partnerships can be a profound equalizer, helping expand quality care and advance health equity. Leveraging the unique power and assets of our GHEN colleagues, we'll maximize our health equity efforts and collaborate to bring quality healthcare to more people,"" said Medtronic CEO and Chairman Geoff Martha.Here are excerpts from three areas within the Zero Health Gaps Pledge, and how Medtronic is bringing them to life:Pledge: Continually seek to understand how our organization can help address the root causes of health inequities and create a positive health equity impact.Medtronic LABS develops community-based, tech-enabled solutions with and for underserved patients, reaching over 1M patients to date. An independent nonprofit organization funded by Medtronic, LABS drives system-level transformation to enable scalable, sustainable, last-mile healthcare delivery.Story continuesPledge: Collaborate with communities to identify key health equity needs and identify potential solutions, and to measure impact.By partnering with local health systems, governments, and NGOs, together we identify gaps in care to build health equity programs. For example, Medtronic established the Health Equity Assistance Program for colon cancer screening to provide GI Genius™ modules to communities with low screening rates or where access to the technology is not currently available.Pledge: Consistently seek to understand health equity needs across our workforce, consumer base, communities, and ecosystem to make strategic decisions, inclusive of investments, and use insights to inform our organization's choices from strategy to execution. Financial stability and wealth are inextricably linked to better health outcomes. Medtronic drives economic opportunity by working with small and diverse-owned suppliers, making $2.7 billion in purchases from small and diverse-owned businesses in FY23. And in partnership with the Medtronic Foundation, the company has established several multi-year, multi-million dollar efforts with groups like Thurgood Marshall Fund and Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers to ensure diverse talent has access and opportunity.Learn more about how our work is impacting communities.Medtronic, Thursday, January 19, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/medtronic Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/735905/Medtronic-Signs-Zero-Health-Gaps-Pledge-To-Advance-Health-Equity]"

203,2ed61b59-d414-398d-a1bd-8e1f105081c2,MOS,2023-01-20,Investors Heavily Search The Mosaic Company (MOS): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-mosaic-company-140002673.html,1674136802,STORY,['MOS'],"[Mosaic (MOS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this fertilizer maker have returned +2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which Mosaic falls in, has gained 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Mosaic is expected to post earnings of $2.08 per share, indicating a change of +6.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.39 points to a change of +126% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -9.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.96 indicates a change of -21.3% from what Mosaic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Mosaic is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MOS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Mosaic, the consensus sales estimate of $4.31 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.1%. The $18.95 billion and $16.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +53.4% and -13.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMosaic reported revenues of $5.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.5%. EPS of $3.22 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -11.01%. The EPS surprise was -8.52%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Mosaic is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Mosaic. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

205,3d5103e4-d51e-3c81-ac56-f6eeb46ec983,ROK,2023-01-20,Rockwell Automation (ROK) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-rok-expected-beat-150103033.html,1674140463,STORY,['ROK'],"[Rockwell Automation (ROK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis industrial equipment and software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.89 billion, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.54% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Rockwell Automation?For Rockwell Automation, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +9.47%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Rockwell Automation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Rockwell Automation would post earnings of $2.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.04, delivering a surprise of +3.40%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Rockwell Automation appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The price of these stocks is artificially inflated. Irrational exuberance associated with a stock may lead to overpricing. Owning such stocks for an inordinate period could lead to erosion of wealth for an investor.However, if you can correctly identify the toxic stocks, you may also gain by resorting to an investment technique called short selling. In short selling, one can sell an unowned stock and then purchase it when the price falls. Naturally, short selling has excelled in bear markets, while it typically loses money in bull markets.As such, identifying toxic stocks is also imperative in shielding one’s portfolio from massive losses or making profits by short selling them. Bally’s Corporation BALY, Omnicell, Inc. OMCL, Illumina Inc. ILMN and Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure PLC AY are a few such toxic stocks.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using a 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this fiscal year and the next during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy/Hold-rated stocks that generally outperform or are in line with the market.

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.76%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 10.92%.Heading into today, shares of the power company had lost 4.26% over the past month, lagging the Utilities sector's gain of 1.22% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.18% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Southern Co. as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Southern Co. to post earnings of $0.24 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 33.33%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.08 billion, up 5.47% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Southern Co.These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

217,149f2c21-2092-3654-8a31-bb9c2d837a3c,TEL,2023-01-20,TE Connectivity (NYSE:TEL) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/te-connectivity-nyse-tel-experiencing-121227977.html,1674216747,STORY,['TEL'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, TE Connectivity (NYSE:TEL) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for TE Connectivity:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$3.0b ÷ (US$21b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, TE Connectivity has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 13% generated by the Electronic industry. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for TE Connectivity compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering TE Connectivity here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsTE Connectivity has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 43% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.The Bottom Line On TE Connectivity's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that TE Connectivity has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has only returned 27% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.Story continuesIf you want to continue researching TE Connectivity, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

218,6cba16ac-158a-3ce0-8b79-2a7fbf46d409,TEL,2023-01-20,Earnings Preview: OSI Systems (OSIS) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-osi-systems-osis-150003750.html,1674140403,STORY,"['OSIS', 'TEL']","[OSI Systems (OSIS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airport security and full-body scanner manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.6%.Revenues are expected to be $302.74 million, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for OSI?For OSI, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that OSI will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that OSI would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of +8.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.OSI doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsTE Connectivity (TEL), another stock in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Components industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.51 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -14.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.76 billion, down 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for TE Connectivity has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.33%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that TE Connectivity will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To facilitate multi-domain operations, this is a crucial phase in the construction of the digital combat network. With the collaboration with Northrop Grumman, one of the top US defense contractors, AT&amp;T has showcased its credibility in creating and offering cutting-edge and reliable 5G network services for military applications as well.The Department of Defense intends to create a digital battle network across its air, land, sea, space and cyber units in order to improve communication and real-time information-sharing capabilities. The collaboration aims to bring a cost-effective, scalable and open architecture solution that will provide a significant tactical advantage on the battlefield that minimizes the decision-making process and ensures optimization of resources. AT&amp;T’s 5G capabilities, blended with Fujitsu’s O-RAN and Northrop Grumman’s strong defense systems, will ensure high speed, low latency and better cyber security protections.AT&amp;T is poised to benefit from the impending 5G boom. As the first carrier in the industry, the company has unveiled its 5G policy framework that will hinge on three pillars — mobile 5G, fixed wireless and edge computing.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10%.Revenues are expected to be $9.66 billion, up 11.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.71% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northrop Grumman?For Northrop Grumman, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Northrop Grumman will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Northrop Grumman would post earnings of $6.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.89, delivering a surprise of -3.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Northrop Grumman appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsTextron (TXT), another stock in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.01 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +7.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.67 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Textron has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.14%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""You're arguing to us that the jury as a matter of law could not find that it was extortionate ... and I'm having trouble with that.""Circuit Judge John Walker said jurors could find Avenatti's demand for a probe ""a cover for this rather massive payment that went way beyond anything that was contemplated by Mr. Franklin, in order to save a firm that was in financial difficulty.""Federal prosecutor Matthew Podolsky said the jury could convict Avenatti by finding it was Avenatti's ""intent to be influenced in his representation of Franklin ... by a payment.""Nike has denied wrongdoing.In 2018, Avenatti shot to fame representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in litigation against Donald Trump stemming from an affair that the former U.S. president says never happened.Story continuesBut his career was destroyed after his March 2019 arrest in the Nike case, where he was convicted of extortion and honest services fraud and sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison.Avenatti subsequently was convicted of defrauding Daniels out of money from a book contract, and admitted to cheating four other clients including a paraplegic out of millions of dollars.He is appealing the Daniels conviction, which added 2-1/2 years to his prison time, and his 14-year sentence over his guilty plea.The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-1778.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Diane Craft)]"
227,75ca05c7-24a7-3783-b91a-3dde9dfd4637,NKE,2023-01-20,Nike (NKE) Up 9.2% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-nke-9-2-since-163004033.html,1674145804,STORY,['NKE'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Nike (NKE). Shares have added about 9.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nike due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.NIKE Q2 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat, Raises ViewNIKE reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein revenues and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s top and bottom lines also improved year over year and were ahead of our estimate. Results gained from brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline.In the quarter, consumer demand for the company’s brands helped deliver strong double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth across NIKE, Jordan and Converse. The strong results were supported by continued strength in retail traffic trends within NIKE Direct, which boosted conversion rates. The strong member buying trends resulted in record digital results in the quarter.Q2 HighlightsIn second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s earnings per share of 85 cents rose 2% from 83 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents and our estimate of 68 cents.Revenues of the Swoosh brand owner grew 17% year over year to $13,315 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,606 million and our estimate of $12,547 million. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues advanced 27% year over year, driven by growth in the NIKE Direct business. Organic revenue growth was higher than our estimate of 19.8%.Sales at NIKE Direct were $5.4 billion, up 16% on a reported basis and 25% on a currency-neutral basis. The 25% currency-neutral increase included 34% growth at NIKE Digital and an 11% rise at NIKE stores, backed by a robust start to the holiday season. The NIKE Brand Digital’s revenues improved 25% on a reported basis and 34% on a currency-neutral basis.Wholesale revenues improved 19% on a reported basis and 30% on a currency-neutral basis. The increase can be attributed to elevated demand for seasonal products and higher shipments, owing to improved supply availability. The results also reflected gains from strong year-over-year comparisons, as the company lapped last year’s shipment delays due to supply constraints.Story continuesOperating SegmentsThe NIKE Brand revenues were $12,724 million, up 18% year over year on a reported basis. We estimated NIKE Brand revenues of $11,987.9 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.8%. Revenues for the brand rose 28% on a currency-neutral basis. Results were driven by continued consumer patronage and strength across all geographies, except for Greater China.Within the NIKE brand, revenues in North America advanced 30% on a reported basis and 31% on a currency-neutral basis to $5,830 million. The upside can be attributed to strong market share gains, driven by a strong start to the holiday season and favorable consumer response to new merchandise. Wholesale revenues for the segment witnessed 37% growth, driven by strong marketplace partner demand and better inventory supply. Sales for the NIKE Direct business were up 23% in the region. Digital sales grew 31%, owing to double-digit growth in traffic and repeat buying trends by members.In EMEA, the company’s revenues rose 11% on a reported basis and 33% on a currency-neutral basis to $3,489 million, driven by broad-based growth. NIKE Direct revenues for the segment grew 44% on a currency-neutral basis, with 62% growth in NIKE Digital. Strong member demand during the Cyber Week was a key driver, marking the highest demand week ever for the EMEA business.In Greater China, revenues declined 3% year over year on a reported basis and rose 6% on a currency-neutral basis in the fiscal second quarter to $1,788 million. The region was impacted by the adverse impacts of COVID-19 disruption in the quarter, leading to muted store operations and retail traffic. NIKE Direct rose 4% on a currency-neutral basis, while NIKE Digital revenues improved 9% year over year.In APLA, NIKE revenues advanced 19% on a reported basis and 34% on a currency-neutral basis to $1,599 million. The increase was driven by strength in Korea. NIKE Direct advanced 30% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by a 35% surge in NIKE Digital.Revenues at the Converse brand grew 5% on a reported basis to $586 million. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues of the segment were up 12%, backed by double-digit growth in North America, somewhat offset by sluggishness in Asia.Costs &amp; MarginsThe gross profit rose 10% year over year to $5,711 million, while the gross margin contracted 300 basis points (bps) to 42.9%. The decline in the gross margin can be attributed to higher markdowns to liquidate inventory, mainly in North America, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated product input costs, and currency headwinds. This was partly negated by the company’s pricing actions.Selling and administrative expenses rose 10% to $4,124 million due to higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A expenses declined 210 bps from the prior-year quarter to 31%.Demand-creation expenses increased 8% year over year to $1,102 million, owing to elevated marketing and advertising investments.Operating overhead expenses were up 10% to $3,022 million on higher wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct costs, as well as increased technology investments to support digital transformation.Balance Sheet &amp; Shareholder-Friendly MovesThe company ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6,490 million, down 40% year over year. It had long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $8,924 million and shareholders’ equity of $15,272 million as of Nov 30, 2022.As of Nov 30, 2022, inventories of $9,362 million increased 43% from the prior-year levels due to an increase in units from the lapping of last year’s supply-chain issues, as well as higher input costs.In second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $480 million in dividends.OutlookBacked by the strong fiscal second-quarter performance, management anticipates low-teens revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal 2023 compared with low-double-digit revenue growth mentioned earlier. Revenue growth, on a reported basis, is expected to be in the mid-single digits compared with low to mid-single-digit growth stated earlier. The revised view includes 700 bps of currency headwinds versus an 800-bps impact mentioned earlier.For fiscal 2023, the company envisions a gross margin contraction of 200-250 bps, driven by continued liquidation actions in the second half. The gross margin decline includes 150 bps of adverse impact from significant markdowns and higher off-price mix to liquidate elevated inventory, along with more than 100 bps headwinds related to elevated freight and logistic costs, and unfavorable currency impacts of 95 bps.SG&amp;A for fiscal 2023 is predicted to increase in the high-single digits due to increased investment in new transformational capabilities, which is likely to be partly offset by reduced expenses and limited headcount growth across the business. The effective tax rate is expected to be in the high-teens range, driven by reduced benefits from stock-based compensation.Moreover, the company predicts third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue growth to be higher than the fourth quarter due to the timing of wholesale shipments. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, the gross margin is likely to decline at a similar rate to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, comprising a 120-bps impact from adverse currency. SG&amp;A expenses are expected to be in line with the fiscal second quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -22.57% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Nike has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Nike has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Data from these studies showed that a third dose of the vaccine generated increased immune responses compared with the data observed in late-stage studies evaluating Nuvaxovid. The vaccine also induced a robust antibody response when used as a heterologous booster dose.Shares of Novavax have plunged 86.5% so far this year compared with the industry’s 8.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNovavax is currently marketing multiple versions of NVX-CoV2373 — one marketed in partnership with the Serum Institute of India under the trade name Covovax and another version produced by Novavax that is marketed under the trade name Nuvaxovid. In the United States, the vaccine is marketed as Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted. Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized for use as a booster in more than 35 countries, including the United States and the European Union.We note that Novavax suffered a lot recently, as the company’s stock has been down for some time now. One of the primary reasons for this was the delayed launch of NVX-CoV2373, compared with its peers like Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA. The vaccines developed by these companies dominate the market space for COVID vaccinations.Story continuesNovavax is currently lagging behind Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, whose vaccines have received full approval for use in adults in the United States. While Moderna’s vaccine is approved for adults aged 18 years and older, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is approved for use in individuals aged 12 years and older. Both these vaccines are also authorized for use in individuals aged six months and above in the United States.Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have also secured EUA from the FDA for using their respective Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines as a single booster dose. The bivalent vaccines of these companies are authorized for use in individuals aged six months and older.Novavax is also lagging in the development of Omicron-specific vaccines. This makes the company vulnerable in terms of gaining a substantial market share in the targeted space.Novavax, Inc. Price Novavax, Inc. PriceNovavax, Inc. price | Novavax, Inc.

This company, which is in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This technology and consulting company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1.28%.For the last reported quarter, IBM came out with earnings of $1.81 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 per share, representing a surprise of 1.69%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.31 per share, delivering a surprise of 0.87%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for IBM. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.IBM has an Earnings ESP of +4.31% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential.

In the last reported quarter, the New York-based integrated systems provider beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. The company is expected to have recorded lower aggregate revenues year over year owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment and softness in traditional businesses.Factors at PlayDuring the fourth quarter, IBM collaborated with Vodafone Group to focus more on quantum-safe cybersecurity issues. Leveraging cloud access to IBM's advanced quantum computing systems and its industry-leading quantum expertise, Vodafone aims to help validate and progress potential quantum use cases in telecommunications. The company launched new software to help enterprises break down data and analytics silos to facilitate faster data-driven decisions and navigate unpredictable disruptions. These are likely to have driven the top-line growth in the Software segment.During the quarter, IBM partnered with the Cloud Security Alliance -- a global not-for-profit firm to help ensure secured cloud computing -- to further advance security and risk management of cloud within financial services. Through the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services, it aims to help clients mitigate risk, tackle ongoing regulations and accelerate cloud adoption. These are likely to have driven incremental revenues in the Financing segment.During the to-be-reported quarter, IBM also inked a partnership with Rapidus to develop logic scaling technology as part of Japan's initiatives to become a global leader in semiconductor research, development and manufacturing. Per the agreement, Rapidus and IBM will work on IBM's breakthrough 2 nanometer (nm) node technology for innovative product development initiatives.The company launched 400 Qubit-Plus quantum processor that reportedly boasts the largest qubit count of any IBM quantum processor. The processor has the potential to run complex quantum computations well beyond the computational capability of any classical computer. Such state-of-the-art products are likely to have translated into higher revenues in the Infrastructure segment.However, escalating expenses toward cloud platform development amid intense competition in the cloud space are likely to have eroded its margins. In addition, the company is likely to have recorded lower revenues in the Consulting segment owing to challenging macroeconomic conditions and rising inflationary pressures.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $15,487 million. It generated revenues of $16,695 million in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $3.60 per share, indicating an improvement from $3.35 in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for IBM this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%, with both pegged at $3.57.

This is expected to be January 31, 2023. On that day, Marathon Petroleum is projected to report earnings of $5.66 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 335.38%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $32.2 billion, down 9.56% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Petroleum. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 11.29% higher.

The average surprise for the last two quarters was 15.28%.For the most recent quarter, Marathon Petroleum was expected to post earnings of $6.80 per share, but it reported $7.81 per share instead, representing a surprise of 14.85%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $9.17 per share, while it actually produced $10.61 per share, a surprise of 15.70%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Marathon Petroleum, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Marathon Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of +4.16% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis spices and seasonings company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.86 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.76 billion, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McCormick?For McCormick, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.86%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McCormick will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McCormick would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of +6.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McCormick doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It’s all creating new wrinkles in airline operations that will be felt by millions of passengers. Kirby pointed out that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline industry did not invest in the future to help it better handle any recovery in its business. ""That means the system simply can't handle the volume today, much less the anticipated growth,"" said Kirby, who became United's CEO in 2020 and was its president for four years prior. ""Like it or not, that's just the new reality and the new math for all airlines.""Kirby said a key constraint holding airlines back is the pilot shortage. During the pandemic, when travel activity was sluggish, airlines offered pilots early retirement packages and grounded flights to cut costs.United, along with its peers, now hope to hire 8,000 pilots combined through 2023 to make up for this shortfall. With the pandemic creating a heightened concern over health and new state legislation making it “easier to call in sick,” Kirby said that operating with the same number of employees as in 2019 or earlier is a recipe for failure. United said it has already made progress on hiring pilots. In 2022, United added more than 2,000 pilots, exceeding its goal, a company spokesperson told Fortune. Earlier in January, thousands of flights in the U.S. were grounded after the Federal Aviation Administration’s pilot alert system faced an outage.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.Story continuesScott Kirby: Well, thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. Before we do our normal walk you through a short deck that explains the intellectual rationale and where we think the industry is headed over a longer term . In short, we think there's ample evidence that there really have been structural changes in the airline industry that set the entire industry up for higher margins than we had pre-pandemic. First, while the specific to the demand environment will be different, we expect it to return to at least it could go higher. Second, we believe cost convergence among all airlines as well as supply challenges may drive structurally higher industry margins. And finally, United has been pretty accurate about the macro outlooks, impact of COVID, and what the recovery would look like going all the way back to February 29, 2020.And based on that, United really did take a different and unique approach to the recovery. At the onset of the pandemic, we acted first, and we acted more aggressively than anyone else to protect our airline and the jobs of the people who work at United. At the time, in fact, some said that we were overreacting and that the pandemic wouldn't be so bad. But by confronting that reality and acting quickly, our leadership team was able to be the first airline to move forward turning crisis into opportunity and began making plans for big investments in United's futures, while others frankly were still in crisis response mode. It clearly had a head start and planning for the recovery, and you're already seeing it in both our absolute results as we've achieved our adjusted pre-tax margin ahead of schedule, and in our relative margin results compared to the rest of the industry.On this next slide, you can see what industry revenues look like as a percentage of GDP over time. A few interesting points: The industry still has about 15% domestic revenue growth left to go just to get back to 2019 levels here in 2023. Our base case 9% and 14% margin targets assume that we just get back to the 0.49%. In the 1990s and 2000s however, revenue to GDP was even higher. As you'll see in the next few slides, we think that cost convergence may drive revenues higher than 0.49%. And for what it's worth, every single basis point of domestic increase translates into about 1 point of margin for United. On slides 5 and 6, I'll address what I think is the most significant structural change to happen to the industry in a long time. For a host of reasons, we believe the industry capacity aspirations for 2023 and beyond are simply unachievable.But, just like 2022, when the industry capacity was 7 points lower than initial guidance, and we believe that same thing will happen this year for the same reasons. We've talked a lot about the pilot shortage, which is just one of multiple constraints. We, along with Delta, American and Southwest alone are planning to hire about 8,000 pilots this year, compared to historical supply in the 6,000 to 7,000 range. Pilots are and will remain a significant constraint on capacity. Post COVID, all companies including airlines and the FAA need to staff at higher levels, lower experience levels combined with sick rates that are elevated because of COVID, and new state legislation that makes it a lot easier to call in sick. We believe in the airline that tries to run at the same stepping levels that it had pre-pandemic is bound to fail and likely to tip over to meltdown anytime there are weather or air traffic control stress in the system.OEMs are behind on aircraft, on engines, on parts. Across the board, there are supply chain constraints that limit the ability of airlines to grow. Finally, the FAA and most airlines with the exception of the network carriers have outgrown their technology infrastructure and simply cannot operate reliably in this more challenging environment. Taking all of the above into the consideration, we think at United, we need to carry at least 5% more pilots per block hour than pre-pandemic. In addition to that, air traffic control challenges mean our taxi and in-route flight times are elevated and growing. So, the same number of block hours probably produces 4% to 5% fewer ASMs. Put it together, we need 10% more pilots and 5% more aircraft to produce the same number of pre-pandemic ASMs. Like it or not, that's just the new reality and the new math for all airline.I think, however, we may be the only airline that's actually figured this out and likely the only airline that has included this in our 2023 CASM-ex guidance already. And to be clear, all of these issues also impact United. The reality is that the airline industry is probably the most complex operational industry with by far the highest safety and regulatory standards of any industry in the country. And COVID hit our industry harder than others. All of us, airlines and the FAA, lost experienced employees and most didn't invest in the future. That means the system simply can't handle the volume today, much less the anticipated growth. At United, we also missed our capacity target for 2022. We had our own challenges over a year ago during Christmas of 21.Omicron hit us all hard. It had also shown a spotlight on other strains in the system. We responded by proactively pulling down capacity. It was the only choice. You can't change the engines on an airplane when it's flying. We flew a lot less last year than we'd have liked to fly, but we did it intentionally, because it gave us the breathing room to make even further investments in our technology and infrastructure, and increase our staffing levels. And we had a huge start -- head start compared to most airlines, because we started with much better technology and infrastructure. But also importantly, we got to acceptance quickly and didn't spend much time in denial about the structural changes. We accepted that the structural changes were real and moved quickly to what to do about it.On that point, I also fully recognize that most or perhaps all of our competitors will get on their calls next week and tell you one time event, no big deal, no change to our capacity plans. If so, I think they are just wrong. It's intellectually hard and takes time to get through the denial phase. What happened over the holidays wasn't a onetime event caused by the weather and it wasn't just at one airline. One airline got the bulk of the media coverage, but the weather was the straw that broke the camel's back for several. This keeps happening, over and over again. And you can see that despite good weather, ULCC still hadn't recovered even as we entered the New Year. The operational difficulties are just the latest among numerous data points proving the systemic challenges that are going to limit the growth in flight.As you can see on the data on slide 6, United's hub locations mean that we pretty much always have the worst weather. In spite of this, we are able to lead the industry, because we are doing a lot of things differently than we did historically. We made significant additional investments in technology and infrastructure. We are running with 5% to 10% staffing buffers. That means, we need more pilots, gate agents, flight attendants, rampers, et cetera to fly the same schedule. We are running with about 25% more spare aircraft than we did pre-pandemic, and we are flying lower aircraft utilization. All of those obviously cost money, but it's clearly the right thing to do for our customers and most -- among the most important things we can do to win their loyalty.And it's turning out these buffers are much less expensive than the cost of avoiding the otherwise inevitable operational meltdowns. In their forward guidance other airlines are likely to talk about returning to 2019 utilization, efficiency, et cetera, but we believe that's just wrong. Our industry has been changed profoundly by the pandemic, and you can't run your airline like it's 2019 or you will fail. But don't take my word for it, watch the data. United will always have the toughest operating environment. Any airline that's operating meaningfully worse than United is out over their skis and is simply outgrown their technology, infrastructure and resources. Slide 7 transitions to the unique setup on the international front. This is one of the most stark examples of what United did differently than our competitors.Over the pandemic, we bet international would return strong post-pandemic. And because we were the only airline around the world with that view of the recovery, we were also the only airline to make two important strategic decisions. We didn't retire widebody aircraft, and we were the only airline in the world that negotiated a deal with our pilot union to keep pilots in place and in position. That allowed us to quickly bounce back. The decisions that our competitors around the globe made to retire aircraft and downgrade pilots take years to reverse. And because of that, they simply can't grow, and you already see that in this summer's capacity data. On slide 8, I've already hit on the theme, so I'll try not to belabor it here, but United had a conscious strategy to use the pandemic to invest in the future.Our large aircraft orders were just the latest example of this. New plans are big ticket items to get lots of attention. But other investments we've made in technology, infrastructure, and people haven't drawn big headlines, even though they too are essential to our success. The point here is that we really were unique. It wasn't just one thing and it wasn't just aircraft. It started with the fact that we always believed in a full recovery. And as a result, we invested and invested early. On slide 9, everything about this deck hopefully gives investors some comfort on why we have confidence in our margin targets. But I think there's potential for margins to go even higher, making slide 9 the money slide for this entire deck for me, at least.You can have whatever view you want about capacity. But what really matters is cost convergence. It's already happening and I'm pretty sure it's going to continue. I believe a world where ULCCs pay their pilots significantly less than us, yet, they can still hire and retain pilots, and they can somehow operate with previous staffing and utilization levels is just the null set. It's not a realistic scenario. And with cost convergence, if I were a betting man, and actually I am, I'd bet that the revenue to GDP ratio is going back to the mid 5s. We'll see. And again, we expect to hit our margin targets even at the 0.49% level. But if it is true, I believe industry margins will go even higher. That's not our official guidance, to be clear, but it's certainly possible.And so, to conclude, I think the pandemic led to a structural change in the industry. The supply-demand dynamics are different than they've ever been in my career. I realize there's a lot of investor skepticism on that. But every data point, keeps demonstrating it over and over again. And because United saw this ahead of everyone else, we were able to invest and prepare to take advantage of it. To be clear, I think margins across the board are going to be higher in the airline industry. But because of the unique steps we took to prepare for exactly this kind of recovery, you're also already seeing United's relative performance is strong and I expect that lead to just expand. A huge thanks to the entire United team. You're really doing an amazing job and you are making United the biggest and the best airline in the history of aviation.And with that, I'll hand it off to Toby, who'll explain some of these critical investments, why they were important to the success for operation through the most difficult holiday operating environment in my career. Toby?Toby Enqvist: Thanks, Scott, and hello to everyone tuning in today. I first want to thank our employees for their exceptional performance over the holidays. We faced a really challenging operating environment that included some of the busiest days of the year and historical cold weather across most of our hubs and line station. While you wouldn't know it from the holiday travel headlines, United was actually the most impacted airline from a weather perspective. 36% of all our flights were exposed 21st, and 26th, more than any other airline in the country. And even though our load factor was already high, we accommodated thousands of additional customers on short notice when their travel on other airlines was disrupted. Despite these headwinds over the holidays, our team connected 90% of our customers within four hours of their planned arrival and served more than 8 million people, 1 million more than we did last year.And our operation performed very well, especially because there were these tough conditions. United was among the airlines with the fewest cancellations during the holidays and we were number one in completion in Denver, San Francisco, Houston and Washington, and Dallas. And we practically eliminated all crew related challenges and cancellations compared to the 2021 holiday period. So, how did we do this? The answer lies in all the planning and investment we made during the depths of the pandemic. Instead of just trying to run the airline like we did in 2019, we worked over the last three years to prepare for a different, more complex operating environment and a sudden surge in travel demand. To prepare specifically for the 2022 holiday period, we've purposely built some slack in the schedule and reduced how often we fly during peak times.We accelerated our hiring and added staffing buffers in key locations. We built firewalls to prevent individual weather events from spilling over into broader network. And finally, we beefed up our training in every department, including clearing out the pilot training backlog to be resource ready for the peak travel demand season. Again, as Scott said, our work to prepare goes back even further. Over the last three years, United invested in systems, training, tools and technology that would empower our employees and benefit our customers a modernized crew scheduling system with 800% improvement in performance, capacity and security versus 2019, a smart schedule and operations coordination to build a reliable and operable schedules, additional spare aircraft in our fleet, updated technology infrastructure supporting our network, operations, airport operations and .Together with our industry leading customer facing technologies like ConnectionSaver and Agent on Demand, both of which now are integrated in our mobile app. Some of these investments are obviously more marketable than others, but they all make a difference in our performance. Finally, I want to point out the biggest difference maker for United this holiday season, our frontline teams. They worked as one team, they volunteered to pick up extra trips and work overtime and again record setting cold temperature. It was the combination of their dedication and the proactive investment in technology and infrastructure that led to our success. And with that, I'll hand it over to Andrew to talk about the numbers.Andrew Nocella: Thanks Toby. TRASM for the fourth quarter finished up 25.8% and PRASM up 24.6% versus the same period in 2019, a 9.5% less capacity, which was similar performance to United's third quarter results and above the high end of our TRASM guidance for the quarter. TRASM growth for non-passenger revenue continued to outpace PRASM and Q4, although that will reverse in 2023. The reversal is due to cargo revenue decline in year-over-year to new post pandemic run rate that remained well above 2019 and co-brand credit card revenue growing slower relative to our rate of ASM growth for the year. PRASM in Q4 was strong across all parts of the network versus 19 with domestic results up 23%, Latin up 30%, Europe 11% and Pacific up 42%.International capacity in the quarter was down 12% and domestic was down 8%. Looking back at our revenue performance for all of 2022, our overall TRASM performance comparing to 19 was up 19.5%, about 6 points better than our expectation for the rest of the industry on average at this point and 3 points better than our network competitors during the same time period. To meet our overall 2023 outlook, we are expecting flattish TRASM for the year versus 2022. The impact of cargo and other revenues on TRASM in 23 is a negative 2 to 3 points year-over-year, implying PRASM up about 2 to 3 points in our outlook. As we think about the revenue outlook for 2023, we are bullish about global long-haul. We expect industry capacity across both the Atlantic and Pacific.The United is the largest carrier to be flattish versus 2019, which provides for an easy setup and positive RASM year-over-year. International demand remains incredibly strong, and we are looking at the potential for record profits and margins across our global network. Asia has traditionally been a margin drag on our global flying, but we've worked diligently to rebuild the network and close this gap. And we think 2023 will validate that we accomplish that goal. Asia is also close to being fully opened, allowing United to reestablish the bulk of the specific flying outside of China. It's worth noting that restrictions on the use of Russian airspace will constrain United from flying both of our China network in 2023. This same restriction will also limit our ability to fly to India.While I would not normally provide revenue details about the months within a quarter, I think it's important to share what we are seeing in Q1. Our unit revenue outlook for February and March is largely consistent with the levels we've seen in the past three quarters at roughly 25% higher than 19. We believe January is a negative outlier in Q1 with unit revenues compared to 2019 softer than the months after it. We think this is primarily due to holiday timing with less demand for incremental weekend trips, enabled by hybrid work schedules, so soon after the year-end holidays. But, we expect the second half of February and March to be back on trend with booked revenue already 30% to 40% above the same period in 2019, and I think this validates our excitement for 2023.Overall, we expect our Q1 TRASM to be up approximately 25% year-over-year. Another positive catalyst for 2022 revenues is the continued but slow recovery of traditional large corporate business travel. While November and December were low relative to October, it's great to see that January is materially better by about 5 points versus the average for Q4. January represents the start of a new budget year for most, so it's a great way to start the year. And we've heard often that budgets in 2022 were exhausted early as to why November and December travel were a bit disappointing for large corporate travel. I talked about the great setup we see in global long-haul earlier. We also see a nice setup for our domestic operations as constraints across the industry are everywhere, creating a favorable supply-demand environment.United is also now quickly executing on United Next plans focused on gauge, premium seating, revenue segmentation, signature interiors and most importantly, restoring and building connectivity, which suffered during the pandemic. We're opening 17 new mainline gates in Newark and 20 in Denver in 2023, which will enhance our customer experience and improve reliability. In Denver, the new gates will allow us to grow our most profitable hub. And in Newark, the new gates will allow us to transition more flights to mainline from Express, consistent with our United Next plans. In addition to gates, we opened more United Club space. In Newark, we have 69% more club space and Denver will be up 180% versus 2019. We also have expanded club space in Chicago by 40% with a new club that opened last week and in Dallas by 43%.Most of these club projects will soon be online and were planned during or prior to the pandemic. Importantly, there are more projects on the way in the years to come. Looking beyond 2023, we continue to implement our United Next plans. We've adjusted our upward -- our long-term gauge plan so that by 2026, our North American gauge will be up 25% versus 2022 and 40% versus 2019. United continues to be undersized in gauge as we await delivery of our large narrowbody planes that are largely absent from our current schedule, creating a margin gap versus our potential and versus others that have a significant fleet size in this category. Activity suffered in 2022 due to a reduction in RJ flying capabilities and delays from Boeing. Pilot staffing at our regional operators has stabilized since pay changes went into effect essentially matching one of our competitors combined with our AVA program that provides a 4-year transition plan for pilots from an express job to a United Mainline career.Regional jet utilization is showing signs of improvement, but we still have a long way to go, and it will be until about 2025 or beyond to get to normal. We have also signed a new agreement with Mesa to expand our large RJ flying in 2023 and associated small community service, while our relationship with Air Wisconsin comes through a natural end. With this change, the number of regional partnerships is reduced from 6 to 5 and will eliminate approximately 40 single-class 50 RJs that were not part of our long-term plans in exchange for adding dual-class 70 CRJs, a clear win for United, small communities and our customers. Rebuilding connectivity will be a key focus in 2023 and 2024, and will be significantly additive to RASMs as it was in 2018 and 19, giving us confidence as we do it with optimal gauge this time around.Thanks to the entire United team. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gerry to discuss our financial results.See also 14 Countries Where Official Language is English and 20 Biggest Companies in Ohio.Gerry Laderman: Thanks, Andrew, and thank you to the whole United team for closing out the year strong. With adjusted pretax income of $1.1 billion, we came in ahead of our fourth quarter expectations and not only returned to pre-pandemic levels of profitability, but actually exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019 on both an operating and pretax margin basis. Even more encouraging in the second half of 2022, we achieved an adjusted pretax margin of 9%, which matches our margin target for 2023 and puts us well on our way for that same success this year. Turning to costs. Our CASM ex performance in the second half of 2022 meaningfully improved versus the start of the year. As I mentioned last quarter, a big driver of this success is the return of the grounded 777 to flying and further improvement in our operational reliability.As we know, a well-run operation is a more cost-efficient operation. Looking ahead, we expect first quarter 2023 CASM-ex to be down between 3% and 4% with capacity up 20% versus the first quarter of 2022. On a full year basis, we expect 2023 CASM-ex to be about flat with capacity up high-teens versus 2022. This full year cost outlook is inclusive of investments in the system that support operational reliability, our current expectations for new labor increases, representing about 4.5 points of CASM-ex, excluding any possible signing bonuses, and a higher inflation outlook for all parts of the business. On the first point, one lesson learned during the pandemic recovery is that it is both economical and profit maximizing to provide cushion to our aircraft utilization.Instead of pushing utilization to its theoretical limit, we are focused on protecting our reliable operation. This minimizes delays and cancellations, which would otherwise drive higher costs such as overtime and customer accommodation costs. Turning to our expectation on profitability. As Andrew mentioned, demand remains healthy. As a result, and using the January 10 forward curve for fuel prices, we expect our first quarter 2023 adjusted pretax margin to be around 3%, resulting in an adjusted diluted earnings per share between $0.50 and $1. Additionally, building on a successful second half of 2022 and with industry dynamics Scott described at the start of the call, we feel even more confident about achieving our United Next 2023 adjusted pretax margin target of 9% and expected adjusted diluted earnings per share between $10 and $12 for the full year.On aircraft, we currently expect to take delivery of 92 Boeing 737 MAXs, 2 Boeing 787s, and 4 Airbus A321neo aircraft in 2023. Assuming all these aircraft are delivered, we now expect full year 2023 total adjusted capital expenditures to be around $8.5 billion. Even with this elevated level of CapEx, based on the capacity, revenue and cost guidance we've outlined, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be positive for the full year. Looking beyond 2023, last month, we announced an aircraft order with Boeing that included 100 firm 787 aircraft, which will address much of our widebody replacement needs through 2032. We also received options for up to 100 additional 787s that can be used for growth if there are margin accretive opportunities to do so.Additionally, the order included 100 incremental 737 aircraft to both, meet planned United Next targets and start preparing for narrowbody replacements in 2027 and beyond. Our aircraft order book is one of our key assets as it provides us with both, cost-saving replacement aircraft and the ability to take advantage of profit-enhancing growth opportunity. The cost of the flexibility built into the order book, we can also adjust the delivery time line as the macro economy dictates. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with liquidity of $18 billion and reduced our adjusted net debt by $3.3 billion versus year-end 2021. We continue to balance liquidity levels with deleveraging activity and financing opportunities as we expect to end the year having met our 2023 target of adjusted net debt to EBITDAR of less than 3 times.We're entering 2023 with a strong foundation, and I want to recognize all of the hard work that has gone into running this great airline. We look forward to delivering to our customers, employees and investors in 2023. And with that, I will turn it over to Kristina for the Q&amp;A.Kristina Munoz: Thank you, Gerry.

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at United Airlines (UAL), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. United Airlines currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for UAL that show why this airline shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For UAL, shares are up 22.28% over the past week while the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry is up 7.05% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 25.28% compares favorably with the industry's 10.36% performance as well.Story continuesWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of United Airlines have risen 15.1%, and are up 10.05% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 6.04% and -12.82%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to UAL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. UAL is currently averaging 9,790,061 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with UAL.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost UAL's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.38 to $6.94 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that UAL is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep United Airlines on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

263,5fcf0293-0e06-374a-9789-b55acc74d561,UAL,2023-01-20,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: United Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JETS and Boeing",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-123612380.html,1674131772,STORY,"['DAL', 'LUV', 'BA', 'UAL']","[For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – January 19, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights United Airlines UAL, Delta Airlines DAL, Southwest Airlines LUV, U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS and Boeing BA.6 Reasons Airlines Can Take Flight in 2023Airlines Have Experienced an Unprecedented Three YearsTo say that the airline industry has had a tumultuous couple of years would be a massive understatement. In March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe and nearly brought air travel (and all travel for that matter) to a standstill. Air traffic dropped by 96% in the immediate aftermath. As panic ensued and the airlines tried their best to survive, companies like United Airlines were forced to lay off thousands of employees (36,000 in UAL's case). Meanwhile, other airlines were forced to retire planes while institutional investors dumped shares in a hurry.In a rare circumstance, Warren Buffett, who had taken large positions in major carriers including United Airlines, Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines was forced to bite the bullet and absorb massive losses in his positions in May of 2020. How bad was the carnage? In the three months following the COVID-19 news going viral, the U.S. Global Jets ETF, an ETF that tracks a basket of major global airlines, lost two-thirds of its value.Next, airlines were ironically falling short of the number of employees (particularly pilots) necessary to meet rising demand after the initial demand shock and the subsequent bounce. The reason for this was the layoffs that occurred earlier in the year, an aging pilot population looking to retire, and vaccine mandates required by the major U.S. carriers which caused some employees to quit (today only UAL requires COVID-19 vaccines).For a brief period between March 2020 and the first half of 2021, airlines seemed to be back on their feet. Citizens began traveling once again and demand began to claw its way back from the lows. The economy and stock market started clicking as the Federal Reserve kept rates at rock bottom levels and the government hurled billions of dollars in stimulus at ailing businesses. However, the euphoria would not last long. The next obstacle airlines would have to face is sky high fuel costs. After crude oil futures briefly went negative in 2020, they stormed back to more than $130 as demand increased and Russia invaded Ukraine.Story continuesCan the Major Airlines Gain Altitude Again?Several positive pieces of information including fundamentals, technicals, and industry specific news suggest that the worst may be behind the airline stocks. Below are 5 reasons why:1.)         United Airlines Unveils Massive Guidance: Tuesday, after the market close, United Airlines announced earnings of $2.46 a share, handily beating consensus analyst estimates of $2.10. The Chicago-based mega-carrier also smashed revenue estimates and provided eye popping guidance for 2023. United now sees 2023 adjusted EPS to soar to between $10 and $12 per share from just $2.52 in 2022 and heavy losses of -$13.94 in 2021 and -$27.57 in 2020. Guidance of this size underscores immense confidence in the business moving forward.2.)         Technical Picture is Improving: United and other major carriers are displaying drastically improving price action. The ""big 4"" domestic airlines are above their 200-day moving averages, signaled a ""Golden Cross,"" and have crossed above multi-year downtrend lines.3.)         Analysts are Bullish: According to Zack's analyst data, Wall Street seconds UAL's bullishness for the industry. Over the past 60 days, consensus analyst estimates are on the rise.4.)         Air Traffic Data: In recent weeks, TSA data suggests that the number of daily airline travelers is back to pre-pandemic levels.5.)         Strong Industry Ranking: The Zack's Transportation – Airline Industry is currently ranked in the top 20% of all industries tracked. It's worth noting because studies have shown that more than half of a company's performance is attributed to the underlying group.6.)         Boeing is a Bullish Barometer: Shares of airplane manufacturing juggernaut Boeing are taking flight and are up 43.5% in the past six months. The super performance comes as the company turns around its production issues. Boeing is seeing strong momentum in deliveries and easing supply chains. In other words, airlines that are looking to expand their fleet should have no issues.Outlook  The past few weeks have been telling for the airline industry. Top tier airline stocks shook off news that the FAA would need to ground flights several days ago. Recent TSA data and earnings reports point to a major recovery and the possibility that the industry is finally putting the pandemic behind it.With that said, investors are best served to be patient and show restraint for the time being if they are not already in the stocks. Airlines like UAL have moved vertically and are up 35% year-to-date and have made dramatic moves off their 2022 lows. In the coming weeks and months investors should look for these stocks to digest gains and offer low risk entry areas. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

(NYSE:PNC) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 18, 2023Bryan Gill: Good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 18, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.Photo by Marga Santoso on UnsplashBill Demchak: Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. 2022 is a successful year for our company, and our strong performance during the year reflects the power of our Main Street bank model and our coast-to-coast franchise. For the full year, we reported $6.1 billion in net income or $13.85 per share. Inside of that, we grew loans and generated record revenue during a rapidly rising rate environment while at the same time we controlled expenses, resulting in substantial positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Turning to our results for the fourth quarter, we generated $1.5 billion of net income or $3.47 per share. Growth in both net interest income and fee income contributed to a 4% increase in revenue. Our expenses were up 6% this quarter, primarily due to increased compensation from elevated business activity, particularly in our advisory businesses.Rob is going to provide more detail on our fourth quarter expenses as well as our outlook in a few minutes. Average loans grew 3% during the quarter, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer. For the full year, average loans were up 15%, and we continue to grow our loan book in a disciplined manner. As we look ahead, we are operating our company with the expectation for a shallow recession in 2023. Accordingly, this outlook drove an increase in our loan loss provision in the quarter and a modest build in reserves under the CECL methodology. Importantly, as the credit environment continues to trend towards normalized levels our overall credit quality metrics remain solid. I'd add that with charge-offs having been so low, it's not surprising to see volatility quarter-to-quarter and we saw this in the fourth quarter with an outsized loss on one commercial credit pushing us outside of our expected range.Story continuesWe continue to manage our liquidity levels to support growth. Our deposits remain relatively stable, and we've increased our wholesale borrowings to bolster liquidity. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total annual capital return to $6 billion. Our progress within the BBVA influence markets continues to exceed our expectations, and we see powerful growth opportunities across our lines of business in these new markets. We continue to generate new customer relationships, and we have been thrilled with the quality of bankers we've been able to hire. In summary, it was a solid fourth quarter as we further built on our post-acquisition momentum, delivered for our customers and communities across the country, generated strong financial results for our shareholders and put ourselves in a position of strength as we move into 2023.As always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to make our success possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more details. Rob?See also 12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own and 9 Famous Pyramid Schemes in US History.Rob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. Loans for the fourth quarter were $322 billion, an increase of $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Investment securities grew $6 billion or 4%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve totaled $30 billion and declined $1.5 billion during the quarter. And our average deposit balances were down 1%, while period-end deposits remained essentially stable. Average borrowed funds increased $15 billion as we proactively bolstered our liquidity with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings late in the third quarter, and these are reflected in our fourth quarter average balances. On a spot basis, we increased our total borrowed funds by approximately $4 billion compared to September 30.The period-end increase was driven by $2 billion of FHLB borrowings and $3 billion of senior debt, partially offset by lower subordinated debt. At year-end, our tangible book value was $72.12 per common share, an increase of 3% linked quarter. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.1% as of December 31, 2022. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility, during the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through approximately $600 million of common dividends and $600 million of share repurchases or 3.8 million shares. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans have increased 11% or $33 billion, reflecting increased loan demand as well as our ability to capitalize on opportunities and our expanded coast-to-coast franchise.During the fourth quarter, we delivered solid loan growth. Loan balances averaged $322 billion, an increase of $9 billion or 3% compared to the third quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. On a spot basis, loans grew $11 billion or 3%. Commercial loans grew more than $9 billion at period end, driven by strong broad-based new production in both our corporate banking and asset-based lending businesses. Importantly, utilization rates within our C&amp;IB portfolio remained stable linked quarter. Consumer loans increased $1 billion compared to September 30, driven by higher residential mortgage home equity and credit card balances, partially offset by lower auto loans and loan yields of 4.75% increased 77 basis points compared to the third quarter, driven by higher interest rates.Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Throughout 2022, deposit balances have declined modestly, amidst the competitive pricing environment and inflationary pressures. Fourth quarter deposits averaged $435 billion and were generally stable linked quarter. Given the rising interest rate environment, we continue to see a shift in deposits from non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And as a result, at December 31, our deposit portfolio mix was 71% interest-bearing and 29% non-interest bearing. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 1.07% during the fourth quarter. And as of December 31, our cumulative beta was 31%. Slide 6 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our fourth quarter securities of $143 billion grew $6 billion or 4%.The increase was largely driven by elevated purchase activity late in the third quarter, which included $3 billion of forward starting securities that settled in the fourth quarter. On a spot basis, securities were $139 billion and increased $3 billion or 2% linked quarter. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 26 basis points to 2.36% driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization. And during the quarter, new purchase yields exceeded 4.75%. At the end of the fourth quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive income improved to $10.2 billion reflecting the accretion of unrealized losses on securities and swaps. Importantly, we continue to estimate that approximately 5% of AOCI will accrete back per quarter going forward without taking into account the impact of rate changes.Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. As you can see, fourth quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5 billion, or $3.47 per share. Revenue was up $214 million or 4% compared with the third quarter. Expenses increased $194 million or 6%. Provision was $408 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of a weaker economic as continued loan growth, which resulted in a $172 million reserve build. And our effective tax rate was 17.7%. Turning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. In 2022, total revenue was a record $21.1 billion and grew 10% or $2 billion compared to 2021. Within that, net interest income increased 22% due to both higher interest rates and strong loan growth. Non-interest income declined 5% and as lower market-sensitive fees more than offset strong card and cash management growth.Looking more closely at the fourth quarter, total revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 4% were $214 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.7 billion was up $209 million or 6%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 2.92%. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $75 million or 4% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million or 3% reflecting the impact of lower average equity markets. Capital Markets and Advisory revenue grew $37 million or 12%, driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, partially offset by lower loan syndication activity.Lending and deposit services increased $9 million or 3%, primarily due to higher loan commitment fees, reflecting our strong new loan production. Residential and commercial mortgage revenue increased $41 million, driven by higher RMSR valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower commercial mortgage banking activities. Other non-interest income declined $70 million linked quarter, reflecting a negative fourth quarter Visa fair value adjustment compared to a positive valuation adjustment in the third quarter, resulting in a change of $54 million. Turning to Slide 9. Our fourth quarter expenses were up $194 million or 6% linked quarter. The growth was largely in personnel costs, which increased $138 million reflecting higher variable compensation related to increased business activity.Fourth quarter personnel costs also included market impacts on long-term incentive compensation plans as well as seasonally higher medical benefits. The remaining balance of the increase in expenses linked quarter included higher marketing spend as well as impairments on various assets and investments. The majority of these impairments will lower our expenses going forward and are included in our expense guidance. As you know, we had a 2022 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we exceeded that goal. Looking forward to 2023, we will be increasing our annual CIP goal to $400 million. This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10.Non-performing loans of $2 billion decreased $83 million or 4% compared to September 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.5 billion declined $136 million or 8% linked quarter. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $224 million, an increase of $105 million linked quarter, driven in part by one large commercial loan credit. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans was 28 basis points in the fourth quarter. Provision for the fourth quarter was $408 million compared to $241 million in the third quarter. The increase reflected the impact of a weaker economic outlook as well as continued loan growth. During the fourth quarter, our allowance for credit losses increased $172 million, and our reserves now total $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans.In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and full year 2022. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're now expecting a mild recession in 2023 resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in Fed funds in both February and March. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until December 2023, when we expect a 25 basis point cut. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows: we expect spot loan growth of 2% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of 6% to 8%. Total revenue growth to be 6% to 8%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up in the range of 11% to 13% and non-interest income to be stable to up 1%.Expenses to be up between 2% and 4% and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we'll generate solid positive operating leverage in 2023. Looking at first quarter of 2023 compared to fourth quarter of 2022, we expect spot loans to be stable, which equates to average loan growth of 1% to 2%. Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter. Fee income to be down 3% to 5% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity. Other non-interest income to be between $200 million and $250 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total non-interest expense to be down 2% to 4%, and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be approximately $200 million.And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc in FocusBased in Pittsburgh, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -3.72%. Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.95%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.21%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.63%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $6 is up 4.3% from last year. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 13.08%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc's current payout ratio is 42%. This means it paid out 42% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.PNC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $15.59 per share, with earnings expected to increase 11.68% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, PNC is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Acadia Realty Trust (AKR) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.18 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.84%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 4.4% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.63%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 20%. Check Acadia Realty Trust (AKR) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Preferred Bank (PFBC) is paying out a dividend of $0.55 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.13% compared to the Banks - West industry's yield of 2.42% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 13.16% over the past year. Check Preferred Bank (PFBC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) has a dividend yield of 3.95%. This is compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.29% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 20%. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

No change to text.)By Jessica DiNapoli and Richa NaiduNEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Top advertisers on Twitter slashed their spending after Elon Musk's takeover, according to estimates compiled for Reuters by research firm Pathmatics, in the latest shock to the company's dominant revenue source.Fourteen of the top 30 advertisers on Twitter stopped all advertising on the platform after Musk took charge on October 27, according to the Pathmatics estimates. Four advertisers reduced spending between 92% and 98.7% from the week before Musk's acquisition through the end of the year.Overall, advertising spending by the top 30 companies fell by 42% to an estimated $53.8 million for November and December combined, according to Pathmatics, despite an increase in spending by six of them.Pathmatics said the previously unreported figures on Twitter advertising are estimates.

Some investors prefer to park their hard-earned cash in income-generating assets, some target value, and some target specific industries, to give a few examples.Of course, there’s also the group of investors that have a preference for small-cap stocks, which can be seen as a less-conservative approach.Small-caps typically have impressive growth trajectories, as these companies are in their early phases. Still, these stocks’ price swings can sometimes become spooky, causing investors to look elsewhere.That’s precisely where large-cap stocks come in.Three large-cap stocks – Splunk SPLK, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, and MercadoLibre Inc. MELI – all carry firm growth profiles, with earnings estimates drifting higher. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three stocks over the last three months, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those who want to target established companies with solid growth trajectories, let’s take a closer look at each one.MercadoLibre Inc.MercadoLibre Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Latin America, offering a total of six integrated e-commerce services. Currently, the company is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Investors will undoubtedly appreciate MELI’s earnings estimates; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $8.20 for its current fiscal year indicates a substantial 390% Y/Y uptick in earnings.And in FY23, estimates suggest a further 80% of earnings growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMercadoLibre has recently impressed with its quarterly results, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in back-to-back releases. In its latest print, MELI penciled in an 11% earnings beat and reported revenue marginally above expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSplunk Inc.Splunk provides software solutions that enable enterprises to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data. Currently, the company boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA strong partner base paired with high demand for cloud solutions has the company on a bright path, with earnings forecasted to soar more than 240% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 40% in FY24.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Splunk’s upcoming quarter is shaping up to be strong; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.10 indicates an improvement of more than 65% Y/Y.Our consensus revenue estimate stands at $1.1 billion, suggesting an uptick of nearly 20% from year-ago quarterly sales of $901 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoyal Caribbean CruisesRoyal Caribbean Cruises is a cruise company that owns and operates three global brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Azamara Club Cruises. Presently, RCL is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company’s shares have gotten off to a fantastic start in 2023, up more than 20% and leaving the S&amp;P 500 in the dust.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA recovery in travel has set the company up to sail through clear waters, with its earnings forecasted to climb 60% in FY22 and 140% in FY23.As we can see in the chart below, the company’s earnings are finally estimated to return back to the green for the first time since the pandemic.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineLarge-cap stocks are typically seen as steady investments, as these companies have fully established themselves through years of operations.Of course, their steady nature is what makes them so cherished by investors, as many market participants don’t enjoy violent price swings.But for those with an appetite for growth, many of these stocks just don’t fit the criteria.However, all three large-caps above – Splunk SPLK, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, and MercadoLibre Inc. MELI – are exceptions, forecasted to grow their bottom line significantly over the next few years.In addition, all three have seen their earnings outlooks drift higher, providing the cherry on top.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A combination of strong headwinds and economic-structural supports are buffeting the industry in contradictory directions, and for at least the near-term the best investment choices aren’t necessarily clear.Take the headwinds first. Some of the strongest revolve around China, the world’s second-largest economy and a major consumer of semiconductor chips. The country was under strict anti-COVID lockdown policies until just recently, which crimped both supply and distribution chains, while also tamping down industrial and technical production. While the logistic issues are easing as the Chinese government backs off from ‘zero-COVID,’ the Biden administration has taken a hard line on tech trade with China, placing restrictions on Chinese purchases of chips and technology from US companies.The industry could have navigated those issues – but it’s also facing a general demand shortage right now. As pandemic restrictions ease around the world, demand for remote access systems has fallen – and that was a big driver of chip consumption in 2020 and 2021.On the positive side, the world’s economy is still digitizing, and semiconductor chips are still an essential product. New and established technologies – such as electric and/or autonomous vehicles, 5G broadband, and the regular improvements to smartphone, tablet, and computer devices – still consume chips at a voracious rate. And that means that investors can find opportunities to buy in.So let’s look at some chip stocks. Using the TipRanks platform, we’ve pulled up the latest scoop on three that are showing a trio of attributes that should attract investor interest: a Buy-rating, double-digit upside potential for the coming year, and recent love from some 5-star analysts. This all adds up to some hot buys in a hot industry. Here are the details.Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR)Based out of Kirkland, Washington, Monolithic Power Systems bills itself as the ‘fastest growing power semiconductor company.’ Its product lines include power modules, power converters, battery management, motor drivers, sensors, and inductors for electronic systems found in a range of applications, including the automotive, IoT, optoelectronics, biomedical, cloud computing, and telecom sectors. Monolithic’s products are found as key components in the offerings of numerous OEMs throughout the economy, and the company’s diversified approach has led to steady gains in both the top and bottom lines over the last several years.Story continuesIn the most recent quarter reported, Q3 of 2022, Monolithic showed an impressive 53% year-over-year increase in revenue, from $323.5 million to $495.4 million. Sequentially, this was a 7.5% gain. At the bottom line, the GAAP net income came in at $124.3 million, or $2.57 per share. The GAAP EPS was up 78% y/y. By non-GAAP measures, the EPS of $3.53 showed a 71% y/y increase.This company hasn’t just given investors a return through revenues and profits; Monolithic also keeps up a reliable dividend payment. The payment is currently set at 75 cents per common share, and the company has been increasing it steadily for the past 9 years. At its current rate, the dividend annualizes to $3 per share, although the yield is a modest 0.75%.In his coverage of this stock for Credit Suisse, analyst Chris Caso notes both structural and historical reasons for optimism on the shares. He writes, “We feel MPWR’s sustainable advantage is driven by two factors. One is their proprietary BCD process, which has historically demonstrated that MPWR can provide more efficient power management products in smaller footprints. The other advantage is MPWR’s smaller size, making them a bit more nimble – and design wins in sizeable areas such as server power and EV have the ability to significantly move the needle at MPWR’s size.”“Our estimates are below consensus through 1H23, as we are simply taking a more conservative view toward market conditions. This doesn’t frighten us. The stock rose in 1H19 even as consensus estimates came down, as the buy side was (again) ahead of the sell-side, and investors took the opportunity to buy one of the highest quality names in the space when it was on sale,” the 5-star analyst went on to add.Taking this view forward, Caso rates MRWR as Outperform (a Buy), with a $475 price target to suggest a one-year share price gain of 24%. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here.)This chip company has picked up 11 recent analyst reviews and they are all positive – backing up a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $383.29 and its average price target of $454.27 implies an 18% potential upside on the one-year horizon. (See Monolithic Power’s stock forecast at TipRanks.)Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI)Next up is Analog Devices, a company known for its product lines in signal processing and data conversion chips. Analog offers a wide product portfolio, with chips and devices applicable to amplifiers, RF and microwave systems, processors and microcontrollers, power management, audio products, industrial ethernet solutions, interface and isolation, power monitors, and clock and timing systems. The company’s customer base, more than 100,000 strong, is primarily B2B. Analog has leveraged its diversified products and large customer base to generate some $12 billion in annual revenues.A look at Analog’s last quarterly report tells the story. In its release, for Q4 of fiscal year 2022, the company had a top line of $3.25 billion, up 39% y/y, and well above the forecast of $3.16 billion. At the bottom line, Analog showed an adjusted EPS of $2.73, for a 58% y/y gain – and again, a significant beat of the forecast, by almost 6%.The company’s gains were driven by strong performance in all four main segments of the business - the automotive, communications, consumer, and industrial. Automotive led the way, with 49% y/y growth.This stock caught the eye of Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland, who pointed out numerous supportive factors for an upbeat rating. “ADI, particularly with their acquisitions of Linear and Maxim, has become one of the great analog catalog companies in the industry,” the 5-star analyst said. “Additionally, they have become the “anti-Texas Instruments,” leaning into distribution, “value creation” incentives, dual-sourced third-party manufacturing, and analog innovation (e.g., wireless BMS). Opportunities around electric vehicles (BMS), communications (5G RF), and specialty analog (medical, instrumentation, aerospace) should help maintain industry-leading margins and growth.”These comments highlight a Positive (Buy) rating on the stock, while Rolland’s $205 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 26%. (To watch Rolland’s track record, click here.)Analog Devices gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 18 recent analyst reviews that include 13 to Buy and 5 to Hold. The shares have an average price target of $195.84, suggesting a 20% upside from the current trading price of $166. (See Analog Devices’ stock forecast at TipRanks.)GlobalFoundries, Inc. (GFS)We’ll wrap up our list of chip stocks with GlobalFoundries, a California-based firm that offers both chip manufacturing and design services to contract customers in a series of industries, including IoT, automotive, computing, and wired networking. As its name suggests, GlobalFoundries operates around the world, and its operations include chip foundries, design centers, and R&amp;D facilities.2022 was GlobalFoundries’ first full calendar year as a publicly traded company, and its last financial release, for 3Q22, was its fifth since entering the public markets. GFS has showed only gains in its public releases; the top line in 3Q22 was $2.07 billion, up 4% sequentially, 12% y/y, and 21% since its first public quarterly report.At the bottom line, net income came in at a record $336 million, while adj. EPS came in at 67 cents, compared to 7 cents in 3Q21 and 58 cents in 2Q22. In short, there’s a global need for silicon semiconductor chips, and GlobalFoundries is leveraging that need to generate solid gains in revenues and profits.Baird’s Tristan Gerra has noticed that, too, and he takes a bullish view of Global Foundries. The 5-star analyst outlines several reasons why this company occupies a sound position for future gains: “GF is skillfully navigating the current waters, notably with a near-exit from PCs (from 25% exiting 2020 to 2% currently) and moving into fast-growth markets, combined with pricing discipline. GF's capacity is oversubscribed for 2022 and 2023. LTAs already account for 75% and 51% of 2024 and 2025 capacity, respectively. Additional LTAs are expected to come online, embedding modest price increases for 2023 and highlighting GF's ability to offer differentiated solutions. GF's exposure to China is small at less than 10%, with no impact from the U.S. export restrictions.”Taking this stance to its logical end, Gerra puts an Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, and his $100 price target implies an upside of 80% for the next 12 months. (To watch Gerra’s track record, click here.)The Strong Buy consensus rating on GFS shares is based on 10 recent analyst reviews, with a 9 to 1 breakdown favoring Buy over Hold. The stock is selling for $55.55 and the $75.09 average price target indicates a potential gain of 35% over the coming year.

280,b1f63758-69eb-3c40-9634-1e62452a11ff,ADI,2023-01-20,7 Top-Rated Chip Stocks for Your January Must-Buy List,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-rated-chip-stocks-114502896.html,1673955902,STORY,"['ALGM', 'AMKR', 'AVGO', 'ADI', 'ASX', 'ARRY']","[Although they’ve received some relief thanks to the latest inflation data, macro uncertainties continue to loom over even the best chip stocks to buy. The global economic slowdown, caused by the raising of interest rates to combat inflation, has led to a slowdown in the tech sector, which could worsen as the year progresses.However, don’t view this as a sign to stay away from semiconductor stocks. Instead, when it comes to top-rated names in the space, now may be an ideal time to buy. Selling for reasonable (and in some cases, more-than-reasonable) valuations, the potential impact of a continued 2023 “tech slowdown” is largely accounted for.Beyond the immediate term, if inflation keeps cooling down, the Federal Reserve may just well make its much-awaited “Fed pivot.” Along with the likely benefits stemming from the CHIPS and Science Act (signed into law last summer), semiconductor stocks could experience outsized gains in the years ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, what are the best chip stocks to buy right now? Consider these seven. Each one earns either an A or B rating in Portfolio Grader.ADIAnalog Devices$168.98ALGMAllegro MicroSystems$33.74AMKRAmkor Technology$31.03ARRYArray Technologies$23.47ASXASE Technology Holding Co.$7.05ASYSAmtech Systems$9.61AVGOBroadcom$579.00Analog Devices (ADI)Analog Devices (ADI) sign outside of buildingSource: jejim / Shutterstock.comAnalog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) develops and makes chips utilized by a variety of end users. According to Statista, 51% of the company’s annual revenue comes from industrial end-users, and 21% comes from the automotive sector.ADI stock has traded sideways over the past twelve months. Although Analog experienced a large amount of revenue and earnings growth during the preceding fiscal year (ending October 2022), the market is concerned about the impact of a recession on results during this current fiscal year.However, trading at a reasonable 17.3 times forward earnings, the impact of a downturn may be already baked into the valuation of this B-rated chip stock.Story continuesSell-side forecasts also call for Analog Devices to stay resilient, with earnings growth re-accelerating started in FY 2024. This may enable ADI, which also has a forward dividend yield of 1.8%, to steadily climb to new highs over the next few years.Allegro MicroSystems (ALGM)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockAllegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) may be lesser known than many of the best chip stocks to buy mentioned above and below, but there’s a lot to like about this specialty semiconductor maker.Namely, because Allegro has heavy exposure to both vehicle electrification and solar energy trends. The company’s sensors and analog power chips are used for a variety of EV and renewable energy industries.This has resulted in steady growth. In its last quarterly results release, Allegro’s revenue grew 23% year-over-year, and earnings per share (or EPS) jumped by around 53%.As the EV and renewable energy trends pick back up, once current economic challenges clear up, this company is poised to continue reporting solid results. In turn, enabling B-rated ALGM stock, which has been in recovery mode since October, to continue making a comeback.Amkor Technology (AMKR)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockDespite surging by nearly 89% over the past six months, Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) continues to trade at what’s arguably a deep-value earnings multiple.Shares in this outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services company trade for just 9.4 times trailing twelve-month earnings.Sure, a low trailing valuation can be a sign of earnings declines ahead. Unfortunately, that’s the case here with AMKR stock, according to analyst earnings forecasts. However, considering factors such as China’s post-pandemic re-opening, it’s possible that an earnings decline this year could be less severe than currently anticipated.If this happens, AMKR could experience moderate multiple expansion. Even a move from its current price-to-earnings (or P/E) ratio, up to a forward P/E multiple in the low teens, would mean yet another double-digit move higher. This chip stock, which also has a 0.97% dividend, earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.Array Technologies (ARRY)a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. Semiconductor stocks to buySource: ShutterstockLike Amkor, Array Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) is another chip stock that has “crushed it” since last July. During this timeframe, shares in this solar tracker manufacturer have more than doubled in price.Unlike AMKR stock, however, ARRY stock has become pricey following its massive run-up. ARRY currently trades for 67.8 times its estimated 2022 earnings. That said, take a look at forecasts for this year, and you can see why this rich multiple is more-than-justified.After swinging back to profitability last quarter, earnings growth is expected to keep coming in at a breakneck pace. In large part, thanks to tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act.Renewable energy incentives provided by this bill could pave the way for EPS to climb from 34 cents in 2022, to 94 cents in 2023, and to $1.34 by 2024. These forecasts suggest more runway ahead for ARRY, A-rated in Portfolio Grader.ASE Technology Holding Co. (ASX)In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.Source: ShutterstockAmong chip stocks to buy, ASE Technology Holding Co. (NYSE:ASX) is one that both trades at a low valuation and has a high dividend yield. Based in Taiwan, ASE Technology Holding is a leading provider of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (or OSAT) services.The tech slowdown has clearly started to have an impact on ASE’s results. For example, the company reported a 19.2% year-over-year decline in revenue last month. This is the second consecutive month that the top line has fallen by double-digits.However, ASX stock trading for only 6.9 times TTM earnings. The market has more than priced in the current rough patch. Once today’s challenges pass, there’s a strong chance of an earnings recovery.This could fuel a continued rebound for shares. This B-rated stock also paid 46.7 cents in dividends (6.75% yield) over the past year, and may sustain this level of payout.Amtech Systems (ASYS)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockBesides Allegro, buying shares in Amtech Systems (NASDAQ:ASYS) is another way to add EV chip exposure to your portfolio.In fact, given the present small size of this micro-cap stock’s underlying business, this provider of silicon carbide and power semiconductor production equipment could experience an even greater level of growth.According to Amtech’s 2022 investor presentation, both the silicon carbide and power semiconductor segments of the industry are expected to keep growing at a rapid clip. This is due to their usage in EVs, renewable energy, and other fast-growing areas such as 5G telecommunications.With plenty of cash on hand (nearly 35% of its market cap) to finance expansion, the company’s growth could really take off. In turn, ASYS stock, after a mixed performance in recent years, may experience its own “liftoff moment.” Trading for only 7.8 times earnings, consider this B-rated stock a buy, as it remains under the radar.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares have steadily climbed since December, when this wireless and broadband chip maker reported solid quarterly results.The AVGO rally though has started to lose momentum in recent trading days. Largely, due to concerns that the company may lose business from one of its key customers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).But even if speculation about this matter turns into an actual loss of business, there are other factors that could outweigh it. As I discussed recently, when talking about AVGO stock, both the 5G rollout, as well as Broadcom’s planned acquisition of cloud computing company VMWare (NYSE:VMW), could prove to be strong catalysts for shares in the future.A more-than-fair valuation (14.2 times forward earnings), and a 3.18% dividend yield, are also factors that make B-rated AVGO appealing at today’s prices. Consider it one of the best chip stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in AMKR and AVGO.

Representing a record, net interest income increased to $1.4 billion during the quarter. The 11 percent increase compared to the third quarter was driven primarily by higher interest rates, continued strong average loan growth and lower than anticipated deposit costs.

Non-performing loans remained stable at 0.52 percent of total loans, while total delinquencies and criticized loans increased modestly. Total net charge-offs for the quarter were $69 million, or 29 basis points of average loans. Excluding the impact of the third quarter consumer loan sale, full-year adjusted net charge-offs(1) were 22 basis points.Provision expense totaled $112 million for the quarter. The increase to the allowance for credit losses compared to the third quarter was attributable primarily to economic conditions, normalizing credit quality from historically low levels, and loan growth. These increases were partially offset by the elimination of the $20 million of hurricane-related reserves established in the prior quarter. The unique factors related to this event are not expected to result in significant losses.The allowance for credit loss ratio remains strong at 1.63 percent of total loans, while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans remains strong at 317 percent.Capital and liquidityAs of and for Quarter Ended12/31/20229/30/202212/31/2021Common Equity Tier 1 ratio(2)9.6%9.3%9.6%Tier 1 capital ratio(2)10.9%10.6%11.0%Tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP)(1)5.63%5.01%6.83%Tangible common book value per share (non-GAAP)(1)*$9.00$8.15$11.38Loans, net of unearned income, to total deposits73.6%70.0%63.1%* Tangible common book value per share includes the impact of quarterly earnings and changes to market value adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income, as well as continued capital returns.Regions maintains a solid capital position with estimated capital ratios remaining well above current regulatory requirements.

Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, and because they also relate to the future they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those described below:Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values, increases in interest rates and unemployment rates, inflation, financial market disruptions and potential reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and conditions.Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and our financial results and conditions.Changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity.The impact of pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and severity of any pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt the global economy, adversely affect our capital and liquidity position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and increase our allowance for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result in lost revenue or additional expenses.Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets, or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to changes in tax law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit or other factors.The effect of new tax legislation and/or interpretation of existing tax law, which may impact our earnings, capital ratios, and our ability to return capital to shareholders.Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating leases.Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally.Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those securities.Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits, which could adversely affect our net income.Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory standards than we are.Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and services to meet customers’ needs and respond to emerging technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our revenue.Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could result in losing business to competitors.Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of the changes in U.S. presidential administration, control of the U.S. Congress, and changes in personnel at the bank regulatory agencies, which could require us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases, or redemptions of preferred stock, must not cause us to fall below minimum capital ratio requirements, with applicable buffers taken into account, and must comply with other requirements and restrictions under law or imposed by our regulators, which may impact our ability to return capital to shareholders.Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of such tests and requirements.Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements (including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards), including our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition and market perceptions of us could be negatively impacted.The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our subsidiaries.The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative, or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which may adversely affect our results.Our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposure so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to support our businesses.Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our ability to fully realize the financial and nonfinancial benefits relating to our strategic initiatives.The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of businesses and risks related to such acquisitions, including that the expected synergies, cost savings and other financial or other benefits may not be realized within expected timeframes, or might be less than projected; and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers.Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to assist in the development, management and operation of our products and services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from time to time.Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners.Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or counterparties.Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our businesses, such as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and other service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach of operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act or failure to deliver our services effectively.Our ability to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services, or delivery platforms.Dependence on key suppliers or vendors to obtain equipment and other supplies for

including wars, conflicts, civil unrest, and terrorist attacks and the potential impact, directly or indirectly, on our businesses.The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods, droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage (specifically in the Southeastern United States), which may negatively affect our operations and/or our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. The severity and frequency of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change.Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment used in the production of commodities), which could impair their ability to service any loans outstanding to them and/or reduce demand for loans in those industries.Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, malware, ransomware, ""denial of service"" attacks, ""hacking"" and identity theft, including account take-overs, a failure of which could disrupt our businesses and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage to our systems, increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our reputation.Our ability to achieve our expense management initiatives.Market replacement of LIBOR and the related effect on our LIBOR-based financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, derivative products, debt obligations, deposits, investments, and loans.Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could, among other negative impacts, increase the costs of funding from capital markets.The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause losses.Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, in particular Regions Bank, could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analyses relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove incorrect.Fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated.The effects of anti-takeover laws and exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.The effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above.Other risks identified from time to time in reports that we file with the SEC.The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, look under the captions ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors"" of Regions’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the ""Risk Factors"" of Regions’ Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the subsequent quarters of 2022, as filed with the SEC.You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as may be required by law.Use of non-GAAP financial measuresManagement uses pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP) and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP), as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted fee income and adjusted efficiency ratios. Net loan charge-offs (GAAP) are presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted net loan-charge offs (non-GAAP). Adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans (non-GAAP) are calculated as adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-GAAP) divided by average loans (GAAP) and annualized. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:Preparation of Regions' operating budgetsMonthly financial performance reportingMonthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)Presentation to investors of company performanceMetrics for incentive compensationRegions’ Investor Relations contact is Dana Nolan at (205) 264-7040; Regions’ Media contact is Jeremy King at (205) 264-4551.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230120005043/en/ContactsMedia Contact: Jeremy King(205) 264-4551Investor Relations Contact: Dana Nolan(205) 264-7040]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. Though high-interest rates challenge most sectors of the economy, certain industries benefit from this particular environment. For example, the financial sector becomes one of the top choices for investors because of its growing profit margins. Similarly, energy, consumer goods, and retailers stand to benefit as interest rates increase. Moreover, analysts recommend loading up on dividend securities as they can maintain their share prices and generate stable income for shareholders.Over the years, dividend stocks have exhibited strong performance in high-interest rate periods. According to a report by Global X, high-dividend stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rates periods from 1960 to 2017. The report also mentioned that half of the high-dividend stocks’ returns came from dividend payments during this period. When investing in dividend stocks, economists recommend companies with proven dividend growth track records, as these stocks have the potential for value appreciation. From May 2005 to April 2015, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index, as reported by ProShares. The report also cited Bloomberg’s data and mentioned that in high-interest rates years during this period, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, significantly surpassing the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index, which returned 8.5%.During a turbulent market, dividend stocks contribute to portfolio returns for the long term. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividend equities are an ideal form of investment for long-term investors as high-dividend stocks are at their best when inflation is above normal levels but starting to fall. Some dividend stocks that are on investors’ radars include Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR).

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”10. Visa Inc.

Revenue grew 19% and EPS grew 33% in the most recent quarter, and double-digit payment volume growth persisted through August. Share price weakness represented a reversal of outperformance earlier this year and may be due to foreign exchange headwinds and concerns about a potential weakening of consumer spending. We continue to own the stock due to Visa’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”9. Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)Dividend Yield as of January 19: 1.51%Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) is a New Jersey-based insurance company that operates in over 54 countries.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”8. The Travelers Companies, Inc.

Codelco did not respond to a request for comment.Global copper prices have also risen, on expectations that Chinese demand is poised to surge after the country - which consumes half the world's copper - abandoned harsh COVID 19-related lockdowns and restrictions that hamstrung economic activity.Fitch Solutions expects China's copper consumption to rise 4.4% this year, after just 1.5% growth in 2022.Anti-pandemic restrictions had also prolonged smelter maintenance and curtailed copper production growth last year, especially in the Guangdong area.Analysts warn that the global copper market may have got ahead of itself, however, with lingering concerns about how fast and how far Chinese growth may recover, while inside China the surge in domestic premiums has raised concerns.""This is the highest in at least the past five years, and the elevated premium will definitely put lots of pressure on our profits, given we're unlikely to source from anywhere else,"" said a Guangdong-based copper tube producer, who asked not to be identified to speak frankly about business conditions.Graphic: China refined copper spot premium/discount https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-COPPER/MAIKE/mopakjbzmpa/chart.pngThe premium paid by copper users in Guangdong province for domestic copper surged in the third quarter of last year to 349 yuan ($51.74) a tonne over the futures price, from just 91 yuan in the prior quarter, and eased only slightly to 327 yuan in the fourth quarter, according to SMM.For annual supply contracts as well, Guangdong smelters hiked their premium to nearly 250 yuan a tonne for this year, up from 130 yuan a tonne in 2022, a mid-sized Chinese copper buyer said.A similar pattern was seen in the industrial east, despite government subsidies from the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to encourage copper imports.Some smelters there have hiked their offers for 2023 copper premiums to 300 yuan a tonne, up from 200 yuan a tonne last year, a Shanghai-based trader said.While Maike's disappearance from the import market has been blamed for disrupting supplies and pricing, China's refined copper imports increased 6.6% in 2022, according to customs data.Domestic inventories of readily available metal, however, fell last year, according to SMM, and traders believe a significant volume of imports in the second half may have ended up in state reserves. The State Reserve Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.Maike said in a statement to Reuters that it is restructuring the company and would soon resume its business. The company has said that it was also seeking support from the local government and financial institutions.($1 = 6.7450 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Siyi Liu and Dominique Patton; Editing by Edmund Klamann)]"

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.John J. Ray III, who previously handled Enron’s restructuring, said that despite the accusations of criminal misconduct against former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives, customers have lauded FTX's technology and said it could be worth reviving the exchange.“Everything is on the table,” Ray told the Journal. “If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.”The FTX token FTT rose 33% on Binance on the news.The decision would come down to whether restarting FTX's international exchange would recover more for customers than just liquidating assets or selling the platform, Ray said.In the interview, Ray also criticized Bankman-Fried's comments to the media and elsewhere as being unhelpful. Bankman-Fried has said FTX did not need to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and has been critical of Ray's decisions.“We don’t need to be dialoguing with him,” Ray said. “He hasn’t told us anything that I don’t already know.”Token Roundup(CoinDesk Research)Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH): The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading around $21,100, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.9%, while both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were down 0.7%.

A look at past data shows just how unusual the recent Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings are. RSI is a widely watched momentum indicator that looks to identify areas where an asset’s price is potentially overbought or oversold.Within the last two weeks, BTC has registered three of the 10 highest RSI readings dating to 2019. Its reading of 89.3 on Jan. 14 ranked third, with its readings on Jan. 16 and 17 ranking eighth and ninth, respectively.ETH’s RSI readings have been more muted, reaching the 12th and 15th highest slots since 2019.The momentum is likely to wane, however. To an extent, we’ve already seen that with both BTC and ETH’s RSI falling to current levels of 78 and 73, respectively. However, a second look at past data shows that we’re still swimming in relatively uncharted waters.Bitcoin RSI Data (CoinDesk)Read the full technical take here.Trending PostListen 🎧: Today’s ""CoinDesk Markets Daily"" podcast discusses the latest market movements and a look at why the recent rally is now in sharp decline.Binance Named as Counterparty in FinCEN Order Against BitzlatoBitcoin Bridged to Avalanche Surpasses BTC Locked in Lightning NetworkCrypto Exchange BitMart to Join Custodian Copper’s ClearLoop Network‘No Point’ to European Union's Crypto Rules Unless World Follows Suit, Official SaysEthereum Development Firm Flashbots Eyes Unicorn Status as It Seeks to Raise $50M: ReportEthereum Name Service's Governance Proposal Outlines Intention to Sell 10,000 ETH]"

Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said on Thursday that interest rates will need to remain high despite signs of easing inflation, given that price pressures are still trending close to 40-year highs. Her comments mirrored similar commitments from other Fed officials this week.But markets remained uncertain over where U.S. interest rates would peak, given that Fed officials offered differing takes on the level, ranging from just below 5% to close to 6%.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,930.90 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,932.35 an ounce by 19:40 ET (00:40 GMT). Both instruments were trading close to their highest level since April 2022, and were set to add about 0.6% this week.Gold prices have been on a tear since data showed a sustained downturn in U.S. inflation, which is likely to invite less hawkish moves by the Fed this year. The prospect of smaller rate hikes brings much relief to bullion prices, which were rattled by a hawkish Fed in 2022.The prospect of a global recession also boosted safe haven demand for gold in recent weeks, amid multiple warnings that major economies could see a contraction this year.Among industrial metals, copper prices retreated in early Asian trade, but were also headed for a fifth straight week of gains amid continued optimism over an economic recovery in China.High-grade copper futures fell 0.2% to $4.2408 a pound, but were up 0.6% this week.Story continuesThe red metal has rallied sharply in recent weeks on growing bets of an economic recovery in China, after the world’s largest copper importer began scaling back most anti-COVID measures in December.Still, recent gains in the red metal were held back by growing fears of a recession this year.Related ArticlesGold prices cool after strong rally, head for fifth week of gainsThousands march on Peru's capital as unrest spreads, building set ablazeOil prices climb on hopes for Fed slowing interest rate hikes]"

Coffee is inherently bitter due to its caffeine content. In general, children don't like coffee for that very reason. But as we grow into adulthood, many of us learn to override the bitter flavors to cash in on the benefits. We like the energy boost a cup of coffee can provide, the aroma of brewing beans, and the social aspects of sharing a warm drink in a convivial atmosphere. All that being said, there are boundaries. And an excessively bitter cup of coffee is likely to prompt pursed lips in the most ardent coffee drinker.Watch the video to learn how to make coffee less bitterWhy is my coffee so bitter?Only 10-15 percent of coffee's bitterness comes from caffeine. Indeed, if the bitterness of your coffee is unacceptable, the problem may well be low-grade beans or a bad brewing technique. Buying low-quality beans will inevitably affect the taste of your brew. Beans that are a mixture of ripe and unripe coffee cherries, defective beans damaged by things like fungus or insects, or beans that are just too old, can all produce an intolerable degree of bitterness.Of course, the higher the grade of coffee you use, the less the chance of your cup of Joe being bitter. However, even top-quality coffee can become unpalatable if you don't get the science right. Mistakes include:Using the wrong sized beans. Grinding coffee beans changes how the flavor compounds dissolve. If they're too finely ground, the result may be a bitter-tasting brew.Brewing your beans for too long, essentially overcooking them.Making the water too hot. According to the National Coffee Association, 195°F to 205°F is the ideal temperature for optimal extraction.Using dirty coffee-making equipment so that all the nasties that accumulate inside affect the taste of your drink.How does salt make coffee less bitter?Bitter coffee can be fixed to a certain extent by adding a dash of salt to your brew. The salt essentially acts as a masking agent. The bitterness itself doesn't actually go away, but the salt inhibits our ability to detect it. That's an excellent band-aid solution. But of course, as with everything, when it comes to bitter coffee, prevention is better than cure.Story continuesMore problems, solvedHot chocolate: Making hot chocolate from scratch is quick and simpleCoffee stains: An unlikely trick to remove coffee stainsHow to prevent pipes from freezingWinter: What to do during a power outage Pet safety: How to keep pets safe during winterWinter: What to do with outdoor furniture Gardening: How to prep your garden for winter What to know about generator safety This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: How to make coffee less bitter using a single ingredient]"

Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages.Murdoch, 91, is the most high-profile figure to face questioning in the case.Fox has argued that it had a right to report on election-fraud allegations made by Trump and his lawyers, and that Dominion’s lawsuit would stifle press freedom. Fox referred Reuters to an earlier statement saying: “There is nothing more newsworthy than covering the president of the United States and his lawyers making allegations of voter fraud.""A judge rejected the network’s bid to toss the case in December 2021. ""From the highest levels down, Fox knowingly spread lies about Dominion,"" the election machine company said in a statement.Murdoch is expected to be questioned in person in Los Angeles on Thursday and Friday by lawyers for Dominion, according to a filing in Delaware Superior Court. The session will be closed to the public. Murdoch’s deposition had previously been scheduled for Dec. 13 and Dec. 14, 2022.Dominion has also sought communications from Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox News personnel, as it seeks to prove that the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy. That is the standard of “actual malice” that public figures must prove to prevail in defamation cases.Doug Mirell, a defamation lawyer who has followed the litigation, said he believes Dominion has an ""air-tight"" case for actual malice because Fox hosts pressed forward with vote-rigging allegations ""well after it was quite clear that these claims were demonstrably false.""Dominion alleged in its March 2021 lawsuit that Fox amplified the false theories to boost its ratings and stay abreast of hard-right competitors including One America News Network, which Dominion is also suing. The complaint cited instances in which Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News and falsely claimed Dominion software may have manipulated vote counts in favor of Biden. A five-week trial in the case is scheduled to begin on April 17.The deposition comes as special committees of the boards of directors for Fox Corp and News Corp consider a proposal from Murdoch to re-combine, nearly a decade after the companies split.

If you want to see more value stocks with big buybacks, go directly to 5 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks.Value stocks are stocks that arguably trade below their intrinsic value. Although the intrinsic value of a stock is subjective because different people can have different prices on what they think a stock is worth, many investors view the stocks of high quality companies with long term growth potential and reasonable forward P/E ratios as value stocks.Many high quality companies trade for lower valuations at the beginning of 2023 given the uncertain macroeconomic climate of rising interest rates, high inflation, and a potential recession this year.In 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially and the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates even further this year. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be a recession that could put pressure on stocks.Nevertheless, if the macroeconomic climate normalizes, valuations could potentially normalize and help the stock prices of many high quality companies in the long term.Some value companies are also companies with big share buybacks.Companies buy back stock to reduce the number of shares outstanding. If they don't issue new stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding could potentially increase their earnings per share if they are profitable and their profits remain the same or rise. If a company's earnings per share rises substantially, its stock could potentially benefit if its price to earnings valuation remains the same.Share buybacks have the advantage of being more flexible than dividends in terms of their timing. While dividends are usually but not necessarily periodic, share buybacks don't have a set schedule.Share buybacks have historically also been more tax advantageous than dividends.While inflation and interest rates will eventually normalize, 2023 could be a volatile year like 2022. If economic data fails to meet estimates, there could be more downside for both the market and value stocks before macroeconomic conditions normalize. As a result, it could be a good idea to own a diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks, we used preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data for Q3 2022 from the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we selected 10 stocks from the list of top 20 buyback stocks that arguably trade below their long term intrinsic value.We ranked the stocks by the amount of buybacks they did in the third quarter per the preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database which held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks10.

Given railroads take a lot of time and capital to construct, the industry is an oligopoly with only a few firms.Although the macroeconomic climate has been challenging, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has nevertheless affirmed pricing gains in excess of inflation dollars for 2022.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. Though high-interest rates challenge most sectors of the economy, certain industries benefit from this particular environment. For example, the financial sector becomes one of the top choices for investors because of its growing profit margins. Similarly, energy, consumer goods, and retailers stand to benefit as interest rates increase. Moreover, analysts recommend loading up on dividend securities as they can maintain their share prices and generate stable income for shareholders.Over the years, dividend stocks have exhibited strong performance in high-interest rate periods. According to a report by Global X, high-dividend stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rates periods from 1960 to 2017. The report also mentioned that half of the high-dividend stocks’ returns came from dividend payments during this period. When investing in dividend stocks, economists recommend companies with proven dividend growth track records, as these stocks have the potential for value appreciation. From May 2005 to April 2015, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index, as reported by ProShares. The report also cited Bloomberg’s data and mentioned that in high-interest rates years during this period, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, significantly surpassing the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index, which returned 8.5%.During a turbulent market, dividend stocks contribute to portfolio returns for the long term. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividend equities are an ideal form of investment for long-term investors as high-dividend stocks are at their best when inflation is above normal levels but starting to fall.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”8. The Travelers Companies, Inc.

Like the last flicker of a candle before flaming out, it's a sign of desperation. Based on our careful, original analysis of his investment track record, at least half of the companies that have (or had) Peltz on their board underperform the S&amp;P during the entirety of his tenure. We shared our analysis with Peltz. His response, in a brief email, was, “Jeffrey, check your nos.” I  have, and I stand by them.Not that Peltz makes this objective analysis of his track record easy. Unlike many of his activist peers, Peltz hasn’t put his comprehensive performance data forward. Trian’s performance is thus unavailable to the shareholders and executives of the companies he targets. We are instead supposed to trust his own unsupported claims about superior performance–despite his track record of having to file regulatory corrections with the SEC for misstating performance.Smoke and bluster add to the confusion. In a CNBC interview last week, Peltz bewilderingly likened the iconic American brand of Walt Disney to the Chinese Communist Party. Would it be just as ludicrous to draw parallels between Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Nelson Peltz because they both brag about their performance but do not transparently share the actual numbers? Why conceal the facts if they are so impressive? Are they just modest or afraid of peer envy?That is not likely since Peltz is shuttering funds under pressure from investors. His major U.K. investment trust “Trian Investors I” apparently has not been actively enlisting major new investors or fundraising the last few years and is currently undergoing liquidation.Story continuesPerhaps his investors are turning for the exits because, despite Peltz’s forceful sales rhetoric on TV, the facts are that he appears to be destroying value rather than adding any, since at least half the companies who have had Peltz on their board underperformed the S&amp;P 500 index during the entirety of his board tenure–measured by both share price performance and total shareholder returns (TSR). These include:Wendy’s: Peltz has sat on Wendy’s board since the inception of Trian Partners in November 2005, until now, during which Wendy’s shares have underperformed the S&amp;P by 5.1% annually, and Wendy’s TSR has underperformed the S&amp;P by 4.93% annually.Mondelez: Peltz was on Mondelez’s board from January 2014 to March 2018, during which Mondelez’s shares underperformed the S&amp;P by 3.59% annually, and Mondelez’s TSR underperformed the S&amp;P by 4.14% annually.Sysco: Peltz was on Sysco’s board from August 2015 to August 2021, during which Sysco shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 2.88% annually, and TSR trailed by 2.22% annually.Janus Henderson: Peltz sat on Janus Henderson’s board from February 2022 to November 2022, during which Janus Henderson shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 23.19% annualized, and TSR trailed by 19.81% annualized.Legg Mason: Peltz’s first stint on the Legg Mason board was from October 2009 to December 2014, during which Legg Mason shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 1.75% annually, and TSR trailed by 2.92% annually.MSG Sports: Peltz has served on the MSG Sports board from October 2015 to the present, during which MSG Sports shares have underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 4.93% annually, and TSR has trailed by 6.32% annually.And it’s not just Peltz. Trian surrogates on boards, namely his son-in-law Ed Garden, the CEO of Trian, seem to have performed no better with their roles on boards, including not only the notorious Chemtura which rode into bankruptcy but also:GE: Garden has served on the GE board from October 2017 until now, during which GE shares have underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 19.07% annualized, and TSR has trailed by 20.13% annually.BNY Mellon: Garden sat on BNY Mellon’s board from December 2014 to May 2019, during which BNY shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 4.38% annually and TSR trailed by 4.67% annually.Family Dollar: Garden sat on Family Dollar’s board from September 2011 to July 2015, during which Family Dollar shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 4.11% annually and TSR trailed by 5.25% annually.Even in some of his successful investments, the companies succeeded by largely doing the opposite of what he advocated.At Pepsi, despite Peltz’s 2014 entreaties, CEO Indra Nooyi smartly refused to divest North American and International beverages, heave off Frito Lay, or staple together Pepsi’s winners with Peltz’s losing hand at Mondelez.At P&amp;G, despite a lengthy 2017 white paper with granularly proposed re-organizations, the two ideas Peltz pushed the most with the board–which were to move some business out of its Cincinnati headquarters “just for disruption” and to decentralize M&amp;A to give it to the business units–were wisely rejected.So why in the world should Disney’s shareholders, largely small retail investors across America, trust Peltz when his own sophisticated investors are fleeing for the exits and when they would have been better off putting their money in an index fund?Peltz thinks he can spin his way out of answering these hard questions by constantly staying on the offense, frenetically bouncing from one proxy fight to another amidst a constant swirl of drama and attention, and launching a barrage of ill-supported, trite accusations against the same Disney leadership that he eagerly embraced just four years ago (not to mention false personal attacks against critics like me). But even the avuncular Peltz cannot outrun his own track record forever as Disney shareholders make their choices.Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:Will the U.S. and Europe slide into recession in 2023? Here’s how to look out when economic outlooks don’tBiggest CEO successes and setbacks: 2022’s triumphs and 2023’s challengesThe U.S. has thwarted Putin’s energy blackmail.

(NYSE: DIS)Unlikely to find any quick fixes with M&amp;A – neither via acquisitions nor salesMargins likely squeezed for years, indicating executive comp should be cutPeltz’s experience in tech, media is limited and track record outside consumer is questionableNeed media expertise, relationships to navigate the shift to streaming with Disney+Cord cutting continues, making traditional distribution model unsustainableReal competitors include Netflix, Inc., others offering Advertising Video on DemandBy John JannaroneThere’s an old-school barbarian at the gates of The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS). But before granting him or any other Wall Streeters entry, Disney should look for answers within the fast-changing media industry its management team knows best.Investor Nelson Peltz, famous for Michael Milken-financed takeovers in the 1980s, wants a board seat at Disney and has mounted a proxy fight after failing to negotiate for a spot directly. The appeal to Mr. Peltz is clear: Disney shares are about 50% off their peak, there appears to be some low-hanging fruit to boost the bottom line, and last, but not least, there’s significant prestige for the 80-year-old investor who may have legacy at the top of his mind.Some of Mr. Peltz’s suggestions are spot on – and probably things “boomerang” CEO Bob Iger (who’s back after a short retirement) and the Disney board agree to be true. First, investments in content were likely overblown in a race to keep up with deep-pocketed rivals.Second, almost no matter how you slice it, the $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox looks regrettable. Since that deal closed in 2019, expectations for Disney’s future profits have edged steadily lower. Consensus 2023 Ebitda projection have declined from $26 billion in 2019 to just $15 billion today, according to Sentieo, an AI-enabled research platform.Consensus 2023 Ebitda Forecast Over Time – SentieoStory continuesBut while Wall Street expectations dimmed, Disney kept up with an old media industry tradition: lavish pay packages even for executives a few rungs from the top. This week, The Wall Street Journal noticed in a filing that former communications chief Geoff Morrell earned an estimated $8,365,403 in total compensation for working just 70 weekdays. Outgoing CEO Bob Chapek (who was fired in November) was also paid a handsome sum: Mr. Chapek earned a total of $24 million in 2022 and is entitled to about $6.5 million in the remaining base salary of his nearly three-year contract along with an additional bonus for fiscal 2023.But those figures don’t even look wild compared with compensation under the Iger administration in the years up to his departure. Mr. Iger, like many big media CEOs, was paid tens of millions annually and even his underlings, including former communications chief Zenia Mucha and General Counsel Alan Braverman, received lavish paychecks. Steve Lipin, a spokesman for Disney, didn’t respond to a request for comment from CorpGov.2021 Compensation Table – SEC FilingCutting back on such packages should be simple enough for Disney’s management and board to understand. Now the company is under extreme scrutiny, it would be reckless to ignore bloated pay packages while shareholders suffer.The real work is navigating Disney’s shift from pay TV to streaming services in a viciously competitive industry where margins are shrinking. That will require executives to roll up their sleeves and perhaps accepts more modest pay for the time being.In fairness to Mr. Peltz, he has plenty of experience as a director at large companies. And people close to his past campaigns say he is backed by savvy analysts who help offer advice to boards even on complex matters. But it’s been widely reported that his track record outside of his core consumer focus isn’t stellar. Reached by telephone, Mr. Peltz directed CorpGov to his the office of his firm, Trian, which didn’t reply to a request for comment.There is no quick fix to the trouble Disney faces. Traditional pay TV – mostly cable and satellite – continues its precipitous decline. When people cancel a monthly package, it hurts cable operators like Charter Communications, Inc. and Comcast Corp. for obvious reasons. The only quick solution they have is to raise prices, which can backfire and accelerate cord-cutting trends.As for the likes of Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., the days of raising so-called affiliate fees to cable and satellite companies to carry their content is probably over. From here, it’s a scramble to convert those viewers to Disney+ or Discovery+ subscribers once they cancel monthly bundles.Disney has a better chance of success than most. After all, almost any household with children is likely to pick Disney over, say, HBO Max because it is wholly dedicated to family content. (Think back to the 1980s when The Disney Channel would trump HBO or Showtime premium subscriptions for households who had to choose just one).Even so, there is a plethora of family content available from deep-pocketed content companies like Netflix, Amazon and others that have invested billions and billions of dollars in content since the early days of streaming. Making matters more difficult, ad-supported models now allow for cheap subscriptions or even free viewing for people willing to watch lots of ads.Mr. Peltz seems to suggest this is an easier task than it is. In his recent presentation, he indicates “surprise” that Disney cannot compete efficiently with Netflix. But Netflix and Amazon freely spend on extremely high-quality content. And their business models have often faced little challenge from investors in recent years. Disney continues to state a target of profitability for Disney+ in 2024 – as it has from the very beginning.What Disney has that Netflix and Amazon do not is decades-long cultural significance and genuine synergies. The “flywheel” across video, movies, toys and parks is real and gives Disney an advantage. Those verticals can all feed off each other in a virtuous cycle that carries on year after year.But Disney still needs to ensure prominence on the streaming landscape by securing subscribers quickly once they cut the cord – or catch younger viewers who never even had satellite or cable. One way to do so is playing nice with broadband providers that see the writing on the wall and understand it’s smart to offer up streaming choices to subscribers.There are hundreds of such operators across the country in addition to a handful of heavyweights. Those distributors aren’t the opponents – Netflix and others making big content bets are the real concern.One other idea that Wall Street often embraces is a big M&amp;A deal to drive quick value (and fat fees for investment bankers). Third Point’s Dan Loeb even suggested Disney sell off ESPN – only to quickly backtrack publicly. The trouble in this market is that such assets probably won’t fetch a good price and such a deal would be a major distraction.Despite the recent tumult at Disney, Mr. Iger has a long track record of building its brand during his marathon-long tenure. Before inviting in a critic from out East, give him a little time get the House of Mouse in order.Contact:CorpGovwww.CorpGov.comEditor@CorpGov.comThe post Disney Should Put on A Better Show without Peltz’s Supporting Role appeared first on CorpGov.]"

Further, other income improved during the quarter.

The top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $8.04 billion.NII, on a taxable-equivalent basis, surged 96% year over year to $1.84 billion.

Higher trading account and non-hedging derivative gains, and other revenues from operations mainly drove the rise.Total other expenses totaled $1.41 billion, flaring up 52%.

Excluding non-operating charges, the non-interest operating expenses were $1.35 billion.The efficiency ratio was 53.3%, down from 59.7% in the year-earlier quarter. A lower ratio indicates a rise in profitability.Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, were $131.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2022, rising 3% from the prior quarter.

ProPetro is an oilfield services provider that primarily operates in the Permian Basin over west Texas and New Mexico.Trading under $10 a share, PUMP stock is starting to look very attractive sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimate revisions on the rise.ProPetro Holding’s earnings are now forecasted to be $0.34 a share for fiscal 2022 compared to -$0.53 a share in FY21 and then leap 546% in FY23 at $2.20 per share which would largely eclipse pre-pandemic levels. PUMP currently has an “A” Style Scores grade for Value and trades at just 4.3X forward earnings compared to its industry average of 13.2X. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line This list of Oil and Energy stocks shows there may still be an abundance of opportunity in the sector. Although oil prices are prone to fluctuate, the rising earnings estimate revisions for these stocks are a great sign with several of these equities offering solid dividends to support patient investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

330,c754f7e9-43c4-3615-905b-2df556060307,HP,2023-01-20,Shell (SHEL) Makes Another Splash in the EV Charging Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-shel-makes-another-splash-133001481.html,1674135001,STORY,"['MUSA', 'HP', 'SHEL']","[A unit of Shell plc SHEL has agreed to purchase an electric vehicle (EV) charging company Volta Inc. VLTA, for $169 million in cash. The acquisition is another pointer to the growing trend among major energy companies toward investments in the EV infrastructure space as demand for such vehicles continues to grow.Per the deal, the London-headquartered energy major will pay 86 cents for each of Volta’s outstanding class A common stock. At Volta’s Tuesday’s closing stock price of 72.70 cents, the transaction values the company’s shares at an 18% premium.Volta, which went public in 2021, primarily sets up charging points in retail parking lots with high traffic (shopping malls, grocery stores etc.) and provides free electricity to EV drivers. The company operates 3,050 EV chargers in the United States and Europe, and gets paid in the form of ads displays on chargers. But of late, it has been struggling with lack of cash and has seen its share price languish below $1 in the past few months. So precarious is the state of cash that the buyout agreement with Shell entails loans to Volta to see it through the closure of the deal, expected by June 30.  For Shell, the Volta deal is yet another step in its endeavor to diversify from oil and invest in green energy management. Europe’s largest oil company previously bought Greenlots — another company involved in EV charging and management —  in 2019 and ubitricity — U.K.'s largest EV charging network — in 2021.   This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, which consolidated its dual headquarters in London over The Hague and became a single UK entity last year, is slated to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 2. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Shell’s to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $2.12 per share.Key Energy PicksMeanwhile, investors interested in the energy sector might look at operators like Murphy USA MUSA and Helmerich &amp; Payne HP.

As of Jan 18, 38 S&amp;P 500 companies have reported their earnings results. Total earnings of these companies are down 13.2% year over year on 7.3% higher revenues with 65.8% beating EPS estimates and 63.2% beating revenue estimates. Our current projection shows that for fourth-quarter 2022, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index as a whole are expected to decline 7.2% year over year on 4% higher revenues.Nevertheless, five midcap stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are set to beat on earnings.

The mid-cap centric S&amp;P 400 Index was down 14.9%. However, in fourth-quarter 2022, the S&amp;P 400 Index witnessed an impressive rally with a gain of 10.3%.This happened despite the fact that the inflation was stuck at its 40-year high level due to the pandemic-led destruction of the global supply-chain system and strong demand from U.S. citizens due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli in the pandemic-ridden years.Moreover, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks led by the Fed, lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine rattled the global financial world last quarter.Our Top PicksFive mid-cap (market capital &gt; $1 billion &lt; $10 billion) companies are set to beat earnings estimates this reporting cycle.

Consumer Price Index may seemingly bode well for costs-of-living dynamics, inflation-fighting stocks to buy is still a good idea. For one thing, it’s probably not wise to make wholesale strategy changes based on a month’s worth of data. Second, the money supply expanded dramatically, meaning much work needs to be done for containment. Therefore, investors shouldn’t give up on inflation-fighting stocks to buy.Moving forward, it’s anyone’s guess what will happen this year. Indeed, with so many wild events erupting in the last three years, few experts will want to stick their neck out. That’s why dividend-paying companies enjoy significant relevance right now, including these inflation-fighting stocks.CLColgate-Palmolive$77.85SRESempra Energy$160.83PSXPhillips 66$103.03IBMIBM.$145.89PMPhilip Morris$101.70VZVerizon$41.86BHPBHP GroupInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsColgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comAs a candidate for inflation-fighting stocks to buy, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) makes sense. The personal care giant carries a forward yield of 2.41%, beating out the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. While it’s not the most generous payout, the company also features 60 years of consecutive dividend increases.Fundamentally, Colgate-Palmolive benefits from inelastic demand. Essentially, people should usually aim to brush their teeth three times a day, along with flossing at least once a day. More than likely, a recession won’t change this regimen. Should people skip a dental appointment or two, they’ll still be brushing their teeth.According to analysts, CL rates as a consensus moderate buy. Among 12 experts, five of them rate CL a buy while the rest say hold. Nevertheless, generally rising exposure among hedge funds – even though the immediate sentiment may be negative – could be a good sign moving forward.Story continuesSempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for inflation-fighting stocks to buy, you probably can’t go wrong with public utilities. Undergirding the necessary services that modern societies need, these entities enjoy practically permanent demand. Specifically, Southern California’s Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) may be one of the best ideas for mitigating rising prices.For one thing, Sempra features a forward yield of 2.85%. To be fair, it’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. However, the company enjoys 18 years of annual consecutive dividend increases. And while its payout ratio isn’t low, at almost 48%, it’s certainly not the highest ratio you’ll see. That’s good for sustainability.Secondly, Sempra strongly benefits from geography. Namely, California represents the U.S. economy’s powerhouse, generating a $3.4 trillion GDP. Per the Los Angeles Times, the Golden State might also become the world’s fourth-largest economy. Whether you like it or not, Sempra is here to stay, making it one of the more compelling inflation-fighting stocks.Phillips 66 (PSX)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockWhile the above two enterprises enjoy reliable and dependable demand structures, we’re also talking about mitigating rising prices. In other words, inflation-fighting stocks to buy should feature more robust payouts. Fortunately, energy giant Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) helps deliver such passive income. At time of writing, the company carries a forward yield of 3.77%.To be sure, critics might point out that this payout slips lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. As well, the company only has two years of consecutive dividend increases. Still, Phillips 66 deserves consideration as one of the inflation-fighting stocks in part because of its payout ratio. At 31.23%, it’s a low and therefore credible metric.Fundamentally, Phillips 66 should benefit from social normalization trends, particularly in the workplace. As major corporations put an end to remote work for all five business days of the week, commuting volume will rise. That should be very helpful for PSX, where the underlying firm specializes in the downstream (refining and marketing) component of the energy value chain.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVAlthough IBM (NYSE:IBM) plies its trade in the exciting technology sector, Big Blue itself isn’t very interesting. For longer than it probably cares to admit, the company held onto legacy businesses that suffered from fading relevancies. Still, with key strategic shifts and acquisitions, IBM now represents a quiet outperformer. For instance, in the trailing year, shares gained almost 10% of equity value.Regarding the topic of inflation-fighting stocks, IBM currently carries a forward yield of 4.52%. This metric ranks well above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the company enjoys 29 years of consecutive dividend increases. While its payout ratio rings a little warm at 66.1%, it’s not the hottest stat ever.Plus, IBM enjoys significant relevancies. Yes, we may be hurtling toward a global recession. But that’s not going to stop tech firms from innovating. Along with its artificial intelligence unit, IBM commands significant relevancies with its enterprise-level cybersecurity services. Therefore, Big Blue will probably make good as one of the inflation-fighting stocks to buy.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comWith Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), this company represents an example of not shooting the messenger. Understandably, some folks may take issue with the company as it makes up the ranks of global big tobacco. At the same time, I write for a broad audience. Therefore, it’s not my right to presume the sensibilities of everyone. Even those who may have hesitancies with PM will find it difficult to ignore the passive income. Currently, Philip Morris features a forward yield of 5%. Again, the consumer staple sector’s average yield sits at 1.89%. As well, PM enjoys 14 years of dividend increases, a trend I’m sure management will want to sustain.Regarding the fundamentals, globally, smoking prevalence declined, which doesn’t seem to support Philip Morris. However, many people still do enjoy their adult liberties and they’re choosing e-cigarettes or vaporizers. Philip Morris invested in this relatively new platform, making it an intriguing (though controversial) idea among inflation-fighting stocks.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockTo be fully transparent, if you want a more conservative approach with your inflation-fighting stocks, you should consider some of the names above. With Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the narrative admittedly becomes incredibly tricky. For one thing, you’re looking at a rather steep market loss, shedding almost 22% in the trailing year.From another angle, the company arguably deserves the fallout. In large part due to Verizon’s aggressive marketing initiatives in 2021, the volatility of the following year hurt VZ stock. As a result, Verizon encountered analyst criticism and pessimism.Though distracting, it’s also fair to point out that investors hard hit with rising prices might give the telecom giant another look. That’s because Verizon offers a forward yield of 6.24%. Notably, the communication sector’s average yield sits at a comparatively low 2.62%. Moreover, Verizon enjoys 18 years of consecutive dividend increases. On a final note, the company currently enjoys a moderate buy consensus view. Therefore, if you want to take a shot, you won’t be the only one.BHP (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockIf you really want to take your inflation-fighting stocks to the next level, then you may want to consider metals and mining firm BHP (NYSE:BHP). For starters, the Australian stalwart represented one of the few winners of 2022. And in the trailing year, BHP gained nearly 17% of equity value. Indeed, near-term sentiment rates strongly, with shares soaring almost 41% in the past half-year period.Fundamentally, geopolitical flashpoints crimped global supplies of critical resources. Therefore, western-friendly countries such as Australia will play a more vital role in international commerce. Specific to BHP, the company specializes in many critical resources, such as copper and nickel. Both feature heavily in advanced solutions such as electric vehicles.Of course, probably the biggest reason why some investors may look to BHP as one of the inflation-fighting stocks to buy is the payout. Commanding a forward yield of 10.1%, stakeholders could be getting passive income superior to some stocks’ annual market returns. However, the downside is that the payout ratio stands at a stratospheric 127.2%. Still, because of increased fundamental relevance, BHP remains intriguing.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

MSI, Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. CMTL.Industry: WirelessLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2040564/3-wireless-stocks-set-to-ride-on-5g-rollout-cloud-transitionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry appears well poised to gain from healthy demand trends with the gradual revival in post-pandemic market conditions and a faster 5G rollout. However, large-scale investments to support the 5G transition, margin erosion due to price wars and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and supply chain adversities might erode profitability.Nevertheless, Motorola Solutions, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc. and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. are likely to benefit from the increasing demand for state-of-the-art wireless products with a vast proliferation of IoT, fiber densification and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions.The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Continuous Infrastructure Upgrade: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services.Story continuesMoreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment.Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Profitability Woes Persist: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pricing pressure in early 5G deals.Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and shortages of other raw materials are likely to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to affect the delivery schedule and escalate production costs. High technological obsolescence of most products and a challenging macroeconomic environment have also escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D.Transition to Cloud Networking Solutions: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions.The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

However, forex remains a headwind.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 30.8% compared with the industry's decline of 2% in the past year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has lost 12.5% in the same time frame.The company, with a market capitalization of $7.91 billion, is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables, dental laboratory products, dental specialty products and consumable medical device products. It anticipates its earnings to improve 3.9% over the next five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Favoring the Stock?DENTSPLY's introduction of PrimeScan, a digital impression scanner, and Primemill, among its other major products, has been driving the company's top line over the past couple of years. It bolstered the consumable areas with Surefil one, Palodent 360 and the digital denture program. The company's Astra EV Implant has been gaining momentum as well.The company launched Primeprint, a medical-grade, highly automated 3D printer, in 2022 to bolster dentists’ workflows and practice efficiency. Apart from being an easy-to-use device, this 3D printer enables dentists to delegate tasks related to 3D printing to their staff. Primeprint provides complete integration with the CEREC system and enables dentists to produce things like night guards, surgical guides and full-scale models in a quick and inexpensive manner.In 2021, the company launched ProTaper Ultimate, which is the first major endodontic platform innovation introduced in its endo business in more than five years. As part of a new platform, this will include new files of biosymmetric sealer and a new disinfection device.Apart from this, the company will also introduce multiple new motor systems in the upcoming months. It will launch CEREC 5.2, a significant upgrade in Primescan, as it further enhances speed and ease of use. This CEREC 5.2 upgrade supports the new dental scanning capability and differentiates Primescan in the marketplace.Story continuesDuring the third quarter, DENTSPLY witnessed double-digit growth in clear aligners, solid performance in Europe, and continued strong demand for Imaging equipment.Apart from these proven products, the company has an excellent new product pipeline that will aid its performance in 2023 and beyond. DENTSPLY initiated a comprehensive review of the entire business to improve execution, build a winning portfolio and return to growth, during 2022. Moreover, the completion of internal investigation removes a major overhang for the company.What's Weighing on It?DENTSPLY recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 billion net of tax during the third quarter. The charge reflected the impact of macroeconomic factors as a result of weakened global demand, higher cost of capital, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and increased raw material, supply chain and service costs.Macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign currency impacts, global supply chain challenges, and regional softness continued for DENTSPLY in China and the United States. Management was not satisfied with the third quarter result.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.8 billion, suggesting a decline of 1.8% from 2022’s preliminary number.For 2023, the consensus mark for adjusted earnings per share stands at $1.87, suggesting a decline of 4.6% from 2022.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

The nonprofit’s enhanced technological capabilities supported its timely expansion into telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing the organization to offer virtual support groups, educational programming and therapy appointments to its clients. And, more recently, Wonderland has used its new solutions to permanently expand its offerings and opportunities for regular visits to clients who may not live nearby.“Partnering with Comcast Business has changed how we operate as a business. Pre-Comcast Business, we did not do remote work,” said Brigette Quichocho, partnerships manager at Wonderland. “Not only are we offering telehealth appointments, but we can also support remote outreach and fundraising events. Previously, we were able to reach maybe 10 people at a time via workplace giving events. Now we are seeing involvement from closer to 100 people during workplace giving activities.”Founded in 1969, Wonderland serves children with developmental delays, disabilities and prenatal substance exposure. Families of any income, insurance or ability to pay can benefit from the nonprofit’s services, which include occupational and physical therapy, speech-language pathology, special education, mental health support, educational advocacy and family resources support. It is also the only clinic in the state of Washington that offers diagnostic and intervention services for children with prenatal substance exposure.When COVID-19 first hit, Wonderland knew it would need to continue to provide its critical services despite the operational challenges brought on by the pandemic. The nonprofit partnered with Comcast Business to successfully upgrade its existing network, which experienced a rapid increase in demand due to the transition to remote work. While the pandemic initiated the clinic’s transition to virtual offerings, the realization that patients were able to secure support on their own time, in the comfort of their own homes, inspired a more permanent transition to hybrid operations.Story continuesLonger term, Wonderland aims to increase the ways in which it uses its Comcast Business solutions to help current and future patients. Recently, the organization kicked off a webinar series designed to raise awareness among doctors and potential clients who would benefit from the clinic’s services.“Wonderland is the perfect example of how businesses of all kinds can use technology not just to maintain a business, but to take it to the next level by solving for unique problems with tailored technology solutions,” said Rob Brenner, vice president of Comcast Business for Comcast’s Pacific Northwest Region. “Comcast has a strong culture of support ingrained in its operations, so we are proud to support Wonderland in its mission to provide opportunities to families with diverse needs.”About Comcast BusinessComcast Business offers a suite of Connectivity, Communications, Networking, Cybersecurity, Wireless, and Managed Solutions to help organizations of different sizes prepare for what’s next.

(NYSE: DIS)Unlikely to find any quick fixes with M&amp;A – neither via acquisitions nor salesMargins likely squeezed for years, indicating executive comp should be cutPeltz’s experience in tech, media is limited and track record outside consumer is questionableNeed media expertise, relationships to navigate the shift to streaming with Disney+Cord cutting continues, making traditional distribution model unsustainableReal competitors include Netflix, Inc., others offering Advertising Video on DemandBy John JannaroneThere’s an old-school barbarian at the gates of The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS). But before granting him or any other Wall Streeters entry, Disney should look for answers within the fast-changing media industry its management team knows best.Investor Nelson Peltz, famous for Michael Milken-financed takeovers in the 1980s, wants a board seat at Disney and has mounted a proxy fight after failing to negotiate for a spot directly. The appeal to Mr. Peltz is clear: Disney shares are about 50% off their peak, there appears to be some low-hanging fruit to boost the bottom line, and last, but not least, there’s significant prestige for the 80-year-old investor who may have legacy at the top of his mind.Some of Mr. Peltz’s suggestions are spot on – and probably things “boomerang” CEO Bob Iger (who’s back after a short retirement) and the Disney board agree to be true. First, investments in content were likely overblown in a race to keep up with deep-pocketed rivals.Second, almost no matter how you slice it, the $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox looks regrettable. Since that deal closed in 2019, expectations for Disney’s future profits have edged steadily lower. Consensus 2023 Ebitda projection have declined from $26 billion in 2019 to just $15 billion today, according to Sentieo, an AI-enabled research platform.Consensus 2023 Ebitda Forecast Over Time – SentieoStory continuesBut while Wall Street expectations dimmed, Disney kept up with an old media industry tradition: lavish pay packages even for executives a few rungs from the top. This week, The Wall Street Journal noticed in a filing that former communications chief Geoff Morrell earned an estimated $8,365,403 in total compensation for working just 70 weekdays. Outgoing CEO Bob Chapek (who was fired in November) was also paid a handsome sum: Mr. Chapek earned a total of $24 million in 2022 and is entitled to about $6.5 million in the remaining base salary of his nearly three-year contract along with an additional bonus for fiscal 2023.But those figures don’t even look wild compared with compensation under the Iger administration in the years up to his departure. Mr. Iger, like many big media CEOs, was paid tens of millions annually and even his underlings, including former communications chief Zenia Mucha and General Counsel Alan Braverman, received lavish paychecks. Steve Lipin, a spokesman for Disney, didn’t respond to a request for comment from CorpGov.2021 Compensation Table – SEC FilingCutting back on such packages should be simple enough for Disney’s management and board to understand. Now the company is under extreme scrutiny, it would be reckless to ignore bloated pay packages while shareholders suffer.The real work is navigating Disney’s shift from pay TV to streaming services in a viciously competitive industry where margins are shrinking. That will require executives to roll up their sleeves and perhaps accepts more modest pay for the time being.In fairness to Mr. Peltz, he has plenty of experience as a director at large companies. And people close to his past campaigns say he is backed by savvy analysts who help offer advice to boards even on complex matters. But it’s been widely reported that his track record outside of his core consumer focus isn’t stellar. Reached by telephone, Mr. Peltz directed CorpGov to his the office of his firm, Trian, which didn’t reply to a request for comment.There is no quick fix to the trouble Disney faces. Traditional pay TV – mostly cable and satellite – continues its precipitous decline. When people cancel a monthly package, it hurts cable operators like Charter Communications, Inc. and Comcast Corp. for obvious reasons. The only quick solution they have is to raise prices, which can backfire and accelerate cord-cutting trends.As for the likes of Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., the days of raising so-called affiliate fees to cable and satellite companies to carry their content is probably over. From here, it’s a scramble to convert those viewers to Disney+ or Discovery+ subscribers once they cancel monthly bundles.Disney has a better chance of success than most. After all, almost any household with children is likely to pick Disney over, say, HBO Max because it is wholly dedicated to family content. (Think back to the 1980s when The Disney Channel would trump HBO or Showtime premium subscriptions for households who had to choose just one).Even so, there is a plethora of family content available from deep-pocketed content companies like Netflix, Amazon and others that have invested billions and billions of dollars in content since the early days of streaming. Making matters more difficult, ad-supported models now allow for cheap subscriptions or even free viewing for people willing to watch lots of ads.Mr. Peltz seems to suggest this is an easier task than it is. In his recent presentation, he indicates “surprise” that Disney cannot compete efficiently with Netflix. But Netflix and Amazon freely spend on extremely high-quality content. And their business models have often faced little challenge from investors in recent years. Disney continues to state a target of profitability for Disney+ in 2024 – as it has from the very beginning.What Disney has that Netflix and Amazon do not is decades-long cultural significance and genuine synergies. The “flywheel” across video, movies, toys and parks is real and gives Disney an advantage. Those verticals can all feed off each other in a virtuous cycle that carries on year after year.But Disney still needs to ensure prominence on the streaming landscape by securing subscribers quickly once they cut the cord – or catch younger viewers who never even had satellite or cable. One way to do so is playing nice with broadband providers that see the writing on the wall and understand it’s smart to offer up streaming choices to subscribers.There are hundreds of such operators across the country in addition to a handful of heavyweights. Those distributors aren’t the opponents – Netflix and others making big content bets are the real concern.One other idea that Wall Street often embraces is a big M&amp;A deal to drive quick value (and fat fees for investment bankers). Third Point’s Dan Loeb even suggested Disney sell off ESPN – only to quickly backtrack publicly. The trouble in this market is that such assets probably won’t fetch a good price and such a deal would be a major distraction.Despite the recent tumult at Disney, Mr. Iger has a long track record of building its brand during his marathon-long tenure. Before inviting in a critic from out East, give him a little time get the House of Mouse in order.Contact:CorpGovwww.CorpGov.comEditor@CorpGov.comThe post Disney Should Put on A Better Show without Peltz’s Supporting Role appeared first on CorpGov.]"
340,cfd55cd2-c997-3b21-81cb-6b9247ee8097,CMCSA,2023-01-20,Comcast (CMCSA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-cmcsa-earnings-expected-grow-150003214.html,1674140403,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[The market expects Comcast (CMCSA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.3%.Revenues are expected to be $30.44 billion, up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.72% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Comcast?For Comcast, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.52%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Comcast will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Comcast would post earnings of $0.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.96, delivering a surprise of +7.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Comcast doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.92% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.18% in that time.Oracle will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Oracle is projected to report earnings of $1.19 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 5.31%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.39 billion, up 17.9% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.91 per share and revenue of $49.74 billion. These totals would mark changes of +0.2% and +17.19%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

By moving its core systems to OCI, including order management, warehouse management, demand forecasting, enterprise resource planning, and its ecommerce platform, Guitar Center has seen performance improvements of more than 30 percent and aims to save more than 40 percent in data platform expenses over the next three years. Additionally, with its inventory and catalog systems, ecommerce platform, and contact center technologies now running on OCI, Guitar Center is able to provide improved response times to customers while offering new services in the channel of their choice.Oracle Logo (PRNewsfoto/Oracle)Guitar Center and its brands employ over 13,000 Associates across more than 550 retail locations in the United States and online, offering new and used musical instruments, rentals, repairs, and lessons to musicians of all ages and musical ability. The pandemic created two contrasting challenges for the retailer, as the global lockdowns led to product supply and customer demand challenges, and the subsequent reopening sparked a huge resurgence. Guitar Center realized that its on-premises infrastructure needed to be upgraded in order to provide the scale, adaptability, and resiliency necessary to ensure uptime and successfully navigate these huge swings in customer demand. As a result, the retailer decided to move its infrastructure, customer-facing applications, and mission-critical workloads to the cloud, and selected Oracle Exadata Database Service on OCI for its scalability, security, and ability to adjust capacity based on demand.Story continues""The past two years have been punctuated by massive fluctuations in customer demand, creating a 'bullwhip effect.' As we navigated the challenges, we realized that we needed to gain elasticity across our infrastructure so that it could be adjusted quickly based on business conditions,"" said Ravi Balwada, CTO, Guitar Center. ""With OCI and its Exadata Database Service, we're able to operate a highly connected, distributed cloud environment without needing to re-platform our core systems. We've improved the efficiency of our systems and expect to be able to realize cost savings of more than 40 percent – while delivering new services and experiences to our customers.""""Few industries have faced more upheaval over the past two years than the retail sector, and retailers have had to become extremely resourceful in finding new revenue streams to grow their businesses,"" said Greg Pavlik, senior vice president and CTO, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with its presence across all the major metropolitan markets of the United States.Thus, PSA is likely to gain from the economies of scale apart from benefiting from brand recognition. It also leverages technology for revenue optimization and cost efficiencies and has invested in technologies in the past few years.In addition, Public Storage has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. For the nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, the company acquired 44 self-storage facilities comprising 3.2 million net rentable square feet of area for $501.9 million. Following Sep 30, 2022, the company acquired or was under contract to buy 33 self-storage facilities spanning 1.7 million net rentable square feet across six states for $262.6 million.With one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and adequate liquidity to withstand any challenges, Public Storage is well-poised to bank on expansion opportunities through acquisitions and developments. Its investment-grade credit ratings render it favorable access to the debt market.PSA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.58% compared with the 9.70% growth estimated for the industry. Its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 78.38% compared with the industry’s average of 4.65%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.However, Public Storage operates in a highly-fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. In recent years, supply has been increasing in many markets. This will likely fuel competition for the company, affecting occupancies and curbing its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Occupancy levels are likely to moderate as tenants revert to more normal move-out behavior as the impact of the pandemic abates, leading to upward pressure on vacate trends and resulting in adverse pressure on rate growth in many markets.Also, rising interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. The company’s shares have declined 2.4%, while the industry has gained 14.1% over this period.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties Inc.

A weeks-long fan backlash made it do a 180,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-tried-back-control-over-092650215.html,1674206810,STORY,['HAS'],"[Following a weeks-long backlash to proposed changes to its licensing agreement, Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro-owned publisher of the influential Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D) role-playing game, decided to put its gameplay mechanics into the public’s hands.On Thursday, the company announced that it would be releasing the ""core D&amp;D mechanics"" through a Creative Commons License. That “lets us give everyone those core mechanics. Forever.” wrote Kyle Brink, the executive director for Dungeons and Dragons, in a post on Thursday, calling it a “decision we can never change.”It’s a pivot for Wizards of the Coast following backlash over potential changes to the company’s “Open Gaming License”, the agreement which allows third parties to use the company’s rulesets and even creative content in their own products.For decades, companies were able to use Wizards’ property free of charge, producing their own games that, at times, outsold the original product. But in early January, fans saw a leaked version of an updated agreement, which suggested that Wizards wanted to regain control of properties based on Dungeons and Dragons. Fans and creators complained, with some tabletop gaming publishers swearing off Wizards of the Coast and D&amp;D forever, likely forcing Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast to hurriedly backtrack on Thursday.Hasbro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.What is the Open Game License?Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop role-playing game first published in 1974. The game allows players to create their own characters, in custom adventures designed according to the D&amp;D ruleset and using a common set of settings, quests, and monsters. The game is considered to have sparked the modern role-playing game, both inspiring other tabletop games and influencing the development of role-playing video games.Wizards of the Coast bought D&amp;D’s original developers in 1997. The publisher itself was bought by Hasbro two years later. The company is also known for its trading card games: it produces Magic: the Gathering and was the original Western publisher of the Pokémon trading card game.Story continuesIn 2000, Wizards of the Coast released the “Open Game License,” which allowed third parties to use elements from the game, like gameplay mechanics or creative content, in their own products.With the OGL, Wizards of the Coast presented itself as a supporter of innovation and creativity—while also ensuring that the company’s core product stayed at the center of the tabletop gaming community. Austin Walker, IP director at studio Possibility Space and host of tabletop gaming podcast Friends at the Table, told the Washington Post that while many of D&amp;D’s core concepts weren’t copyrightable, the OGL allowed the Wizards to “capture a lot of the creative energy” in tabletop gaming.What changed?Wizards of the Coast has spent much of the past six months preparing for the latest revamp to its game, titled “One D&amp;D.” But while the company might have hoped gamers would be more interested in changes to the gameplay, people were more interested in changes to how the game might be licensed to creators.Leaked versions of the new OGL, reported by io9, suggested that Wizards of the Coast wanted to regain control over third-party uses of its property. The drafted agreement would revoke all previous agreements, requiring publishers to renegotiate with Wizards of the Coast to continue selling their products. It severely limited what creators could make, largely restricting them to just tabletop games rather than other media like videos or video games. All creators would have to register their works with Wizards of the Coast, and grant it an “irrevocable” license to their creations. And, finally, the most successful creators would have to pay royalties.Independent publishers, already uneasy with Wizards of the Coast, said they would ditch Wizards of the Coast altogether. Last Thursday, Paizo, which produces the successful Pathfinder games through the OGL, said it had “no interest whatsoever” in the new agreement.Instead, Paizo said it would develop a new license that would be “open, perpetual, and irrevocable,” that would “unquestionably keep alive the spirit of the Open Game License.”Fans even threatened to boycott the upcoming movie Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, distributed by Paramount and based on the D&amp;D property. The film is scheduled for release on March 31.‘We rolled a 1’As backlash spread, Wizards of the Coast tried to engage in damage control.On Jan. 14, Wizards of the Coast said it had poorly explained the rationale for the changes. “It’s clear from the reaction that we rolled a 1,” Brink wrote in a statement, referring to the dice rolls used to determine success or failure in tabletop games.But fans remained unhappy by Wizards’ half-hearted acceptance of responsibility. “You’re going to hear people say that they won, and we lost because making your voices heard forced us to change our plans. Those people will only be half right. They won—and so did we.” Brink wrote.When that failed to quell fan anger, the company's tone became more apologetic. “We are sorry. We got it wrong,” Brink wrote on Wednesday, apologizing for being “disruptive to creators” and “being silent for far too long.” Brink promised that the company would be more transparent about potential changes, and pledged that the new license would not include royalty payments nor affect ownership.The new draft agreement, released Thursday, backtracks on several fan complaints, including royalty payments, financial reporting, and revoking permissions for previously-approved content.‘Killing the golden goose’Both Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro are facing a more difficult economic environment. In October, Hasbro cut its full-year revenue forecast for 2022, forecasting flat or even slightly negative revenue growth, citing reduced consumer spending spurred by higher inflation. The company made $1.68 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, a 15% decrease year-on-year.Wizards of the Coast reportedly canceled several video game projects based on its properties, including some based on Dungeons and Dragons, earlier in January.Fans of other Wizards’ properties are unhappy with the publisher’s business decisions. Magic: the Gathering players have complained that the company is printing too many new cards. Fans were particularly unhappy with the company’s “30th Anniversary” set, which sold for a whopping $1000.In late November, Bank of America downgraded Hasbro to “underperform”, citing complaints from fans that the company was overprinting cards. Bank of America warned the company was “killing the golden goose”, and suggested shares might fall by up to a third. (Cynthia Williams, president of Wizards of the Coast, later said during a UBS event that there was no evidence it was reprinting cards, and that high prices for cards on the primary and secondary market were instead proof that the company wasn’t meeting demand).Prices of trading cards spiked during the COVID pandemic, both due to increased interest from players stuck-at-home and speculators hoping to flip a return from rare cards. The Pokémon Company printed nine billion cards in 2021 to bring down sky-high prices.Hasbro shares plunged 4.1% on Thursday. Shares in the toy company are down 37.3% over the past year.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

It also gained significant contributions from all sales platforms. The results benefited from increased interest and fees on loans. However, the results were partially offset by steep expenses and decreased average active accounts.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.12 suggests a 24.3% decrease from the prior-year figure of $1.48. The consensus mark remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $4 billion indicates a 5.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure while our estimate suggests 2.6% year-over-year growth.Synchrony beat the consensus estimate for earnings in all the prior four quarters, with the average being 7.3%. This is depicted in the graph below:Synchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial price-eps-surprise | Synchrony Financial QuoteFactors to NoteSynchrony Financial is expected to have benefited from a better purchase volume in the fourth quarter as the economy is growing and people are spending more. Our estimate for total purchase volumes for the quarter under review indicates an improvement of 11.6% year over year.SYF is expected to have consistently gained from digital sales volume in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate suggest that the average active accounts in the Home &amp; Auto platform are expected to have risen 2.9% year over year in the fourth quarter.The financial service provider is expected to have witnessed an increase in Average Interest-Earnings Assets. The consensus estimate indicates a 7.5% increase in the metric from the year-ago period while our estimate suggests a 6% jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the efficiency ratio is pegged at 36.78%, suggesting a decline from the prior-year reported figure of 41.10%.Story continuesWhile the above-mentioned factors are likely to have benefited the company in the fourth quarter, some elements are likely to offset the positives, leading to an earnings miss and year-over-year decline. The company is expected to have incurred increased employee costs and information processing expenses in the fourth quarter.Increased expenses are expected to have reduced the margins in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the net interest margin is pegged at 15.4%, down from 15.8% a year ago. The net charge-offs are also expected to have increased in the quarter in review.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Synchrony this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -10.60%.

""It brought me up to minimum wage there at last,"" 1,072 yen ($8.31) an hour in Tokyo.Steep price increases on surging raw materials costs are squeezing Japan's workers, as years of deflation or minimal rises give way to 41-year-high inflation of 4%.Major companies, under government pressure, are offering their biggest raises in decades. The operator of clothing giant Uniqlo plans raises of up to 40%, and more than half of big firms in a Reuters survey plan wage hikes.But many of the small and midsize firms that employ the vast majority of Japanese workers cannot keep up.The situation is worse for workers like Fujino, one of a growing number of non-regular or temporary employees who often do lower-paid jobs not subject to the minimum wage or social security.Their numbers have risen since then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched policies a decade ago that boosted stocks and corporate profits but did not boost wages much. Irregular workers were 36.7% of the workforce last year, up from 31.5% in 2019, government data shows.Fujino gets an average 250,000 yen ($1,900) a month from his two jobs. Some months it is half of that, due to seasonal factors.""I'm really jealous of places like Uniqlo with their raises - and I wonder if we'll ever see the same,"" he said.""Uniqlo sells clothes, but they rely on a lot of people like shippers and so on. When they raise pay for their salaried workers, they need to cut back in other places. I just hope this won't make people at the bottom like us suffer even more.""A university dropout, Fujino worked part-time jobs during Japan's late 1980s economic boom years, then became a bartender before shifting to manual labour 20 years ago. Sometimes he works nights, sometimes it's the day shift.Story continuesWhen he has time off, he might enjoy a long soak in a cheap public bath.Single, Fujino cooks most of his own food - rice, dried seaweed, a fried egg, rice balls, maybe with pickled plums. Occasionally he eats at inexpensive diners or goes out for drinks.Sometimes in the past, ""I'd buy a whole bunch of hamburgers at McDonald's. But the price has gone up from 110 to 170 yen in the last year,"" he said. ""Now I could only buy half of what I once did.""National health insurance pays for the blood-pressure medication he needs and he rents a one-room apartment.He just laughs when asked about savings and retirement.""I don't think I'll have an old age - after all, I have high blood pressure. I probably have another 10 years, and I'll be able to make it through that,"" he said.""Who I really worry about are the young guys doing the same work.""($1 = 128.9900 yen)(Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by William Mallard)]"

The company’s top and bottom lines also improved on a year-over-year basis, given the strong demand in markets associated with industrial capital goods and commodities amid inflation for products, particularly fasteners and transportation services.Fastenal’s shares dropped 1.1% in the pre-market trading session on Jan 19, after it reported fourth-quarter 2022 results.Earnings &amp; Sales in DetailThe company reported earnings of 43 cents per share, which beat the consensus mark of 42 cents and rose more than 7% from the year-ago period.Net sales totaled $1,695.6 million, beating the consensus mark of $1,675 million and increasing 10.7% from the year-ago figure of $1,531.8 million.The company reported daily sales of $27.3 million, reflecting an increase of 10.7% year over year in the reported quarter. The upside was mainly due to higher unit sales owing to good demand from industrial capital goods and commodities, which offset softer markets tied to consumer goods and relatively lower growth in construction. The foreign exchange adversely impacted sales by 90 basis points.On a monthly basis, daily sales improved 8%, 10.2% and 13.6% in December, November and October 2022, respectively, year over year.Daily sales of Fastener products (mainly used for industrial production and accounting for approximately 33% of fourth-quarter sales) rose 24.2% year over year.

This was due to lower product margins in other product categories and unfavorable price/cost dynamics.

This national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies will pay out a quarterly dividend of 35 cents per share on Mar 2, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Feb 2.The company currently has a dividend payout ratio of 66% and a dividend yield of 2.57% based on the closing share price of $47.54 on Jan 18. Over the past two decades, Fastenal has been paying out annual dividends. Also, it paid out special one-time dividends in December 2008, December 2012 and December 2020.With the recent move, FAST is maintaining its commitment to increase stockholders’ returns regularly. The move reflects the company’s sound and stable financial position, and commitment to rewarding shareholders amid industry-wide challenges.Will This Sustain?Fastenal has been paying cash dividends since 1991. It has been consistently sharing its cash flows with shareholders and maintaining a strong financial position. It ended third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $231.5 million versus $236.2 million at 2021-end. The company has sufficient funds to meet the short-term obligation of $150.3 million. Operating lease liabilities, net of the current portion, at September-end were $161.2 million, slightly up from $156 million at 2021-end. Nonetheless, it has no significant debt maturity in recent years. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Additionally, cash provided by operating activities was $257.9 million for third-quarter 2022 versus $167.4 million a year ago. This reflects significantly improved levels of cash flow for the quarter. The company’s financial strength, access to low-cost capital and ability to generate cash flow provide confidence to its stakeholders.Investors always prefer a return-generating stock. A high-dividend-yielding one is much coveted. It goes without saying that stockholders are always on the lookout for companies with a record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Although shares of the company underperformed the industry in the past year, earnings estimates for 2023 moved up to $1.92 per share from $1.90 in the past 30 days. The trend is likely to continue, given its solid cost-control measures, combative investment to increase Onsite locations and focus on e-commerce business.

In second-quarter fiscal 2023, off-premise sales contributed 25% to total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at LongHorn and 13% at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Notably, technological enhancements in online ordering, the introduction of To Go capacity management and Curbside I'm Here notification have benefited the company.On the other hand, at LongHorn, the company strives to attract guests by focusing on its core menu, culinary innovation and regional flavors. It is also working on its marketing strategy to improve execution; customer relationship management and digital advertising as well as promotional pipeline that leverages the segment’s expertise.The company has been focusing on strengthening its in-restaurant execution through investments in quality, improving staffing levels and simplifying operations to enhance the guest experience. Sales are being supported by various initiatives and personalized services, which are likely to drive long-term growth as well. During the fiscal second quarter, sales at LongHorn were up 9.7% year over year to $600.5 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn order to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand, the company implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan. These included simplifying kitchen systems, improving sales planning and scheduling, achieving operational excellence to improve guest experience, developing new core menu items, allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments. The revamped restaurants are already generating high same-restaurant sales and returns.Meanwhile, the company is also focusing on technology-driven initiatives like the system-wide rollout of tablets in order to capitalize on digitization, which has rapidly penetrated the U.S. fast-casual restaurant sector. This initiative has been providing a boost to the company’s sales for the past few quarters.

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Let me begin by thanking our global team for delivering an excellent quarter and year. We have had outstanding results despite challenging headwinds from the capital markets and the overall economic backdrop. In the face of this, our focus has been to serve our customers and investors putting our heads down and executing on our long-term plan. As you see in our results, our portfolio is in excellent shape, driven by still strong demand and a continued lack of availability. This foundation for our business not only drove our nearly 13% increase in year-over-year core earnings, but it also sets up the company for sustainable growth for years to come.Story continuesTurning to results. Core FFO excluding promotes was $4.61 per share and including promotes was $5.16 per share, ahead of our forecast. In the fourth quarter, our operating results again generated several new records. Occupancy increased to 98.2%, with retention of 82%. The Prologis portfolio excluding Duke added 30-basis-point of the 40-basis-point increase over the quarter. While we tend to quote occupancy, it is notable that the portfolio is 98.6% leased, a record that underscores the tightness across our markets. Rent change for the quarter was 51% on a net effective basis. The step down from our third quarter rent change of 60% is a reflection of mix and not market rents. In fact, market rent growth exceeded expectations during the quarter, increasing our lease mark-to-market to a record 67%.These results drove same-store growth to 7.7% on a net effective basis and 9.1% on cash. The Duke portfolio having closed on October 3rd, is fully integrated in these results, with the exception of same-store growth, which will not be reflected until the first quarter of 2024. On the balance sheet, while access to the debt markets have remained challenging for many issuers, we successfully executed a number of transactions during the quarter, raising over $1.1 billion at an interest rate below 3%, including $700 million of new unsecured borrowings out of Japan and Canada. Our credit metrics continue to be excellent and we have maintained over $4 billion of liquidity at year-end with borrowing capacity across Prologis and the open-ended funds of $20 billion, expanded significantly due to our balance sheet growth from the Duke acquisition.With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions.While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024.In Europe, we expect deliveries to outpace absorption by approximately 30 million square feet, expanding the current 2.6% vacancy rate to approximately 3.5%. Finally, and as expected, our true months of supply metric grew to 25 months in the U.S. from 22 months last quarter. As a reminder, this metric has averaged roughly 36 months over the last 10 years. In capital markets, transactions continue to be slow in the fourth quarter, making price discovery challenging. That said, return requirements are trending to the low-to-mid 7% range. This expansion further affected appraised values in our funds, although continued rent growth has mitigated some of the effect. Our U.S. values, which were appraised by third parties every quarter, declined 6% this quarter and 7% over the entire second half.In Europe, values declined approximately 12% during the quarter and 16% over the half. Our open-end funds have received only modest redemption requests, less than 3% of net asset value during the quarter, totaling 5% across the second half. Our flagship funds have strong balance sheets with low leverage, largely undrawn credit facilities, cash on hand and undrawn equity commitments. While we believe the value declines over the second half reflect market, investors are still adjusting to a new environment. Because we strive to be consistent in our actions and fair to all investors, we will redeem units call equity and resume asset contributions when price discovery has run its course. We expect that to be one quarter to two quarters away likely sooner in Europe.This will ensure certainty, fairness and consistency to all of our investors. Turning to our outlook for 2023, while our macro forecast assumes a moderate recession, which may put headwinds on demand, our business is driven by secular forces and long-term planning by our customers that should limit the impact unless such a downturn becomes significant and protracted. As mentioned earlier, we believe vacancy will build in the market and our portfolio, both of which are unsustainably low. Putting this sentiment together with our outlook on supply and demand, our 2023 rent forecast calls for approximately 10% growth in the U.S. and 9% globally. We acknowledge that our rent forecasts have proven conservative in recent years, but we are comfortable with this starting point given the environment.Specific to our portfolio and on an our share basis, we expect average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5%, roughly 50 basis points lower than the 2022 midpoint. Combined with rent change, we forecast to generate net effective same-store growth of approximately 8% to 9% with casting store growth between 8.5% and 9.5%. Given these assumptions, we believe our lease mark-to-market will be sustained or even increased over 2023, ending the year between 65% and 70%, and providing visibility to an incremental $2.9 billion of NOI after the more than $300 million that will become realized over the course of this year. We expect G&amp;A to range between $370 million and $385 million, reflecting not only inflation in wages and other corporate costs, but also additional investments we are making in our Essentials business particularly in the energy teams.In that regard, we expect the contribution to FFO from Essentials to range between $0.07 and $0.09 this year. This reflects 70% growth in revenues and tax credits from 2022, but offset in the near-term by our higher Duke related share count and the G&amp;A investments just mentioned. In terms of operational metrics for the business, we expect to add 115 megawatts of solar power over the year driving the portfolio to approximately 540 megawatts by year end. It's worth noting that we closed 2022 as the second largest on-site power producer in the U.S., a position we will build upon with our plan for 1 gigawatt of production and storage by 2025. We also forecast to have over 20 EV charging clusters installed and operational by year-end. In deployment, we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to new starts.We have over $39 billion of opportunities to select from in our land bank and between our expectations for build-to-suits and logical markets prospect, we see an active year of starts initially to range between $2.5 billion and $3 billion with a real opportunity to grow as conditions warrant. As mentioned earlier, we plan for redemptions to be cleared out over the year and private fundraising to resume. Accordingly, we forecast contribution activity to occur primarily in the second half and resulting in combined contribution and disposition guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion. Finally, in strategic capital, we forecast revenues excluding promotes to range between $500 million and $525 million, which is impacted by valuation write-downs across 2022 and the first half of 2023.We are forecasting net promote income of $0.40 based on an assumption that U -- that values in USLF, primary source of 2023 promotes will decline further from values at year end, every 1% change in asset value equates to slightly less than $0.02 of net promote income. Putting this all together, we expect core FFO excluding promotes to range between $5 per share and $5.10 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents approximately 9.5% growth over 2022. We are guiding core FFO including promotes to range between $5.40 per share and $5.50 per share. In closing, this guidance builds upon an exceptional three-year period of sector-leading earnings growth. At our 2019 Investor Day, we presented a three-year plan, targeting 8.5% annual growth, we achieved nearly 14% over this period, 550 basis points of annual outperformance.We expect 2023 to be a year where headlines continue to be disconnected from our business and ability to deliver strong growth and valuation. While there are many unknowns generally, there are more knowns in our business that are clear, such as our lease mark-to-market, significant and visible opportunity in our land bank, a need for excitement for -- a need and excitement for a new generation of sustainable energy solutions, and a dedicated team that is the best in the business and laser focused on delivering leading results.

Check Out These 2 Finance Names,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-stocks-positive-earnings-momentum-140002546.html,1674136802,STORY,['PLD'],"[Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Reinsurance Group (RGA) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $3.62 a share 14 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 2, 2023.RGA has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.59%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.62 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.56.RGA is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Prologis (PLD) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on April 18, 2023, Prologis holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.25 a share 89 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prologis is $1.22, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.29%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, RGA and PLD could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

363,e0ee2327-3215-365f-9099-74544b1a6736,RHI,2023-01-20,Earnings Preview: Robert Half (RHI) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-robert-half-rhi-150003015.html,1674140403,STORY,['RHI'],"[Robert Half (RHI) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis staffing firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.74 billion, down 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.69% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Robert Half?For Robert Half, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.58%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Robert Half will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Robert Half would post earnings of $1.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of -7.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Robert Half doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

365,eb23ef48-0b58-30fa-9966-f46b7c83b467,UPS,2023-01-20,"United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-ups-attracting-140002145.html,1674136802,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned +0%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has gained 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $3.59 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $12.92 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.5%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.20 indicates a change of -5.6% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UPS is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UPS, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $28.09 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $101.4 billion and $99.74 billion estimates indicate +4.2% and -1.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $24.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.2%. EPS of $2.99 for the same period compares with $2.71 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.65%. The EPS surprise was +5.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. Though high-interest rates challenge most sectors of the economy, certain industries benefit from this particular environment. For example, the financial sector becomes one of the top choices for investors because of its growing profit margins. Similarly, energy, consumer goods, and retailers stand to benefit as interest rates increase. Moreover, analysts recommend loading up on dividend securities as they can maintain their share prices and generate stable income for shareholders.Over the years, dividend stocks have exhibited strong performance in high-interest rate periods. According to a report by Global X, high-dividend stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rates periods from 1960 to 2017. The report also mentioned that half of the high-dividend stocks’ returns came from dividend payments during this period. When investing in dividend stocks, economists recommend companies with proven dividend growth track records, as these stocks have the potential for value appreciation. From May 2005 to April 2015, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index, as reported by ProShares. The report also cited Bloomberg’s data and mentioned that in high-interest rates years during this period, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, significantly surpassing the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index, which returned 8.5%.During a turbulent market, dividend stocks contribute to portfolio returns for the long term. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividend equities are an ideal form of investment for long-term investors as high-dividend stocks are at their best when inflation is above normal levels but starting to fall. Some dividend stocks that are on investors’ radars include Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR). However, in this article, we will discuss the best dividend stocks for rising interest rates.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:We scanned Insider Monkey's database of stock holdings of 920 elite hedge funds and picked the top 11 dividend-paying companies that either benefit from higher interest rates or remain unaffected in a rising interest rate environment. These companies operate in sectors like financials, mortgage, energy and consumer goods. Moreover, these companies have strong dividend policies which would help investors to generate stable income in the current market situation. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields, as of January 19.11 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Dividend Yield as of January 19: 0.76%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American company that operates an international chain of membership warehouses. In December, the company reported $23.8 billion in sales, up 7% from the same period last year. Moreover, its net sales for the 18 weeks that ended on January 1 amounted to $82.6 billion, compared with $76.3 billion a year ago.In January, DA Davidson raised its price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $478 with a Neutral rating on the shares, following its December sales data. The firm mentioned that the company is the first major retailer to provide 'an indication of a rebound'.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.76%, as of January 19. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 18 years, which places it as one of the best dividend stocks for rising interest rates.In addition to dividend stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is gaining ground among investors due to its dividend growth streak.At the end of Q3 2022, 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 64 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $4.4 billion.Madison Funds mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”10. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Dividend Yield as of January 19: 0.82%Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a California-based multinational financial services company. It is one of the best dividend stocks for rising interest rates as the company derives its revenue from client services and licensing fees and has less exposure to high-interest rates.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”8. The Travelers Companies, Inc.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Pentair (NYSE:PNR), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Pentair with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Pentair Pentair's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Pentair grew its EPS by 16% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for Pentair remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 15% to US$4.1b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Pentair?Story continuesAre Pentair Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Pentair, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$29m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 0.3% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.Should You Add Pentair To Your Watchlist?One positive for Pentair is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Pentair (at least 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

The company’s sales also witnessed more than 70% growth from the time its first distribution center was opened in 2018.The new facility will meet growing customer demand in the Ohio and Upper Midwest regions. The distribution center will provide for nearly 250 stores, and help fulfill online orders for customers in Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and other parts of the Upper Midwest region. Also, the move will create 500 additional jobs in the Stark County area.What Else Do You Need to Know?Tractor Supply is on track to build up on its Out Here lifestyle assortment and convenient shopping format to gain customers and market share. The strategy is essentially based on five key pillars, including customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return. As part of the plans, it revised the long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026.Management envisions achieving net sales growth of 6-7%, while comps are expected to grow 4-5%. The operating margin is expected to be 10.1-10.6%, up from the earlier mentioned 9-9.5%. Earnings per share are likely to grow 8-11%, up from the previously stated 8-10%.Earlier, the company launched the Field Activity Support Team (“FAST”) and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise.Tractor Supply is in the initial phase of transforming its side lots and mature stores to improve space productivity, bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life, and advancing efforts to remain nationally strong and locally relevant. Management anticipates transforming the side lots in 100 locations in 2022. These have been significant investments in stores. These are expected to boost productivity across the existing and new stores.Given the changing consumer trends, Tractor Supply is focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience.The company is on track with the ‘ONETractor’ strategy to connect stores and online shopping. The company’s omni-channel investments, include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and a new mobile app. Its e-commerce business witnessed high-single-digit growth from the prior year.Tractor Supply added app features such as My Pet and upgraded its in-store mode. The company expanded the program to include Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. The move will enable it to gain pet customers for both banners. The mobile app has also been performing well. Management earlier predicted to reach more than $2 billion in sales by 2026.The company’s store expansion initiatives bode well. It is well-positioned to expand its store base, remaining on track to increase its domestic store to 2,500 in the long term. In the third quarter of 2022, the company opened 11 Tractor Supply stores and two Petsense stores. Management is on track with its store-opening initiatives. It plans to open 60-70 Tractor Supply stores and 10 Petsense stores in 2022.Driven by these factors, management raised its guidance for 2022. The view reflects the recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, which is likely to contribute $75 million to sales in the fourth quarter and 2022.The company expects net sales of $14.06-$14.12 billion, up from the prior mentioned $13.95-$14.05 billion. Comps are likely to grow 5.4-5.8%, up from earlier stated 5.2-5.8% growth. The operating margin is anticipated to be 10.1-10.15% compared with the previously stated 10.2%.

374,8c65e871-bee5-34db-accc-595d95bc9208,TSCO,2023-01-20,Tractor Supply (TSCO) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tractor-supply-tsco-earnings-expected-150003241.html,1674140403.0,STORY,['TSCO'],"[The market expects Tractor Supply (TSCO) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis retailer for farmers and ranchers is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21.8%.Revenues are expected to be $3.88 billion, up 16.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tractor Supply?For Tractor Supply, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.53%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tractor Supply will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tractor Supply would post earnings of $2.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.10, delivering a surprise of +0.48%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Tractor Supply doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Conagra Brands has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Mondelez has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CAG likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MDLZ has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.CAG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.56, while MDLZ has a forward P/E of 20.81. We also note that CAG has a PEG ratio of 2.08. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. MDLZ currently has a PEG ratio of 3.07.Another notable valuation metric for CAG is its P/B ratio of 2.10. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MDLZ has a P/B of 3.31.These metrics, and several others, help CAG earn a Value grade of B, while MDLZ has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesCAG sticks out from MDLZ in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that CAG is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

376,b504ce21-5b8d-34f6-89c7-c6473b167ed2,MDLZ,2023-01-20,The last flicker of the candle as Peltz melts,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/last-flicker-candle-peltz-melts-160400754.html,1674144240,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'DIS', 'MDLZ']","[Given the sharp contrast between Disney chief Bob Iger’s widely celebrated performance record–with cumulative total shareholder returns of 554% during his tenure–and the ambiguous performance of activist Nelson Peltz’s Trian fund, CNBC anchor David Faber recently wondered on air, “Why would Peltz persist in his battle [over Disney]?”It seems Peltz needs the drama and attention. Like the last flicker of a candle before flaming out, it's a sign of desperation. Based on our careful, original analysis of his investment track record, at least half of the companies that have (or had) Peltz on their board underperform the S&amp;P during the entirety of his tenure. We shared our analysis with Peltz. His response, in a brief email, was, “Jeffrey, check your nos.” I  have, and I stand by them.Not that Peltz makes this objective analysis of his track record easy. Unlike many of his activist peers, Peltz hasn’t put his comprehensive performance data forward. Trian’s performance is thus unavailable to the shareholders and executives of the companies he targets. We are instead supposed to trust his own unsupported claims about superior performance–despite his track record of having to file regulatory corrections with the SEC for misstating performance.Smoke and bluster add to the confusion. In a CNBC interview last week, Peltz bewilderingly likened the iconic American brand of Walt Disney to the Chinese Communist Party. Would it be just as ludicrous to draw parallels between Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Nelson Peltz because they both brag about their performance but do not transparently share the actual numbers? Why conceal the facts if they are so impressive? Are they just modest or afraid of peer envy?That is not likely since Peltz is shuttering funds under pressure from investors. His major U.K. investment trust “Trian Investors I” apparently has not been actively enlisting major new investors or fundraising the last few years and is currently undergoing liquidation.Story continuesPerhaps his investors are turning for the exits because, despite Peltz’s forceful sales rhetoric on TV, the facts are that he appears to be destroying value rather than adding any, since at least half the companies who have had Peltz on their board underperformed the S&amp;P 500 index during the entirety of his board tenure–measured by both share price performance and total shareholder returns (TSR). These include:Wendy’s: Peltz has sat on Wendy’s board since the inception of Trian Partners in November 2005, until now, during which Wendy’s shares have underperformed the S&amp;P by 5.1% annually, and Wendy’s TSR has underperformed the S&amp;P by 4.93% annually.Mondelez: Peltz was on Mondelez’s board from January 2014 to March 2018, during which Mondelez’s shares underperformed the S&amp;P by 3.59% annually, and Mondelez’s TSR underperformed the S&amp;P by 4.14% annually.Sysco: Peltz was on Sysco’s board from August 2015 to August 2021, during which Sysco shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 2.88% annually, and TSR trailed by 2.22% annually.Janus Henderson: Peltz sat on Janus Henderson’s board from February 2022 to November 2022, during which Janus Henderson shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 23.19% annualized, and TSR trailed by 19.81% annualized.Legg Mason: Peltz’s first stint on the Legg Mason board was from October 2009 to December 2014, during which Legg Mason shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 1.75% annually, and TSR trailed by 2.92% annually.MSG Sports: Peltz has served on the MSG Sports board from October 2015 to the present, during which MSG Sports shares have underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 4.93% annually, and TSR has trailed by 6.32% annually.And it’s not just Peltz. Trian surrogates on boards, namely his son-in-law Ed Garden, the CEO of Trian, seem to have performed no better with their roles on boards, including not only the notorious Chemtura which rode into bankruptcy but also:GE: Garden has served on the GE board from October 2017 until now, during which GE shares have underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a whopping 19.07% annualized, and TSR has trailed by 20.13% annually.BNY Mellon: Garden sat on BNY Mellon’s board from December 2014 to May 2019, during which BNY shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 4.38% annually and TSR trailed by 4.67% annually.Family Dollar: Garden sat on Family Dollar’s board from September 2011 to July 2015, during which Family Dollar shares underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 4.11% annually and TSR trailed by 5.25% annually.Even in some of his successful investments, the companies succeeded by largely doing the opposite of what he advocated.At Pepsi, despite Peltz’s 2014 entreaties, CEO Indra Nooyi smartly refused to divest North American and International beverages, heave off Frito Lay, or staple together Pepsi’s winners with Peltz’s losing hand at Mondelez.At P&amp;G, despite a lengthy 2017 white paper with granularly proposed re-organizations, the two ideas Peltz pushed the most with the board–which were to move some business out of its Cincinnati headquarters “just for disruption” and to decentralize M&amp;A to give it to the business units–were wisely rejected.So why in the world should Disney’s shareholders, largely small retail investors across America, trust Peltz when his own sophisticated investors are fleeing for the exits and when they would have been better off putting their money in an index fund?Peltz thinks he can spin his way out of answering these hard questions by constantly staying on the offense, frenetically bouncing from one proxy fight to another amidst a constant swirl of drama and attention, and launching a barrage of ill-supported, trite accusations against the same Disney leadership that he eagerly embraced just four years ago (not to mention false personal attacks against critics like me). But even the avuncular Peltz cannot outrun his own track record forever as Disney shareholders make their choices.Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:Will the U.S. and Europe slide into recession in 2023? Here’s how to look out when economic outlooks don’tBiggest CEO successes and setbacks: 2022’s triumphs and 2023’s challengesThe U.S. has thwarted Putin’s energy blackmail.

Snacks offices into its headquarters located in Camden. Management expects to invest nearly $50 million to improve its Camden facilities over the next three years.Campbell Soup anticipates realizing cost savings from consolidating the buildings to start in fiscal 2024 and reach annual cost savings of $10 million by fiscal 2026. The realized savings will be reinvested in the business and are included in its plan to enhance margins in the Snacks unit.Savings Plan on TrackCampbell Soup has been progressing well with its cost-saving plan. The company’s strategy of concentrating on supply-chain efficiencies, curtailing costs and reinvesting part of these savings in high-growth potential areas is noteworthy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company generated $10 million in savings under its multi-year cost-saving program, including Snyder’s-Lance synergies, bringing total program-to-date cost savings to $860 million. Management is on track to deliver savings worth $1 billion by fiscal 2025-end.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s More?Campbell Soup is benefitting from its growing Snacks business. The segment formed 43.5% of the company’s top line in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Net sales in the division rose 15% (also organically) to $1,120 million. The upside can be attributed to sales of power brands which rose 21%. Sales growth was fueled by a rise in cookies and crackers, specifically Goldfish crackers and in salty snacks, Snyder's of Hanover pretzels and Kettle Brand and CapeCod potato chips. Inflation-driven pricing and sales allowances were somewhat offset by soft volume and higher promotional spending.Campbell Soup’s Snacks unit has been standing out for a while now. This business will likely tap incremental sales, backed by a proven growth model with strength in the power snacks brands and higher innovation.Such prudent investment and strategic efforts, evident from the latest consolidation of the buildings, are likely to keep narrating CPB’s growth story.

Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates are likely to have hurt 2022 net sales 3-4%, which raises concerns about the quarter to-be-reported as well.The company has been battling high input costs for the past few quarters. The company’s third-quarter operating profit was affected by a rise in input costs to the tune of $360 million. Reduced volumes, escalated marketing, research and general expenses and unfavorable foreign currency also affected the operating profit. The company expects input cost inflation of $1.4-$1.6 billion for the full year. That said, management has been focused on undertaking relevant pricing actions to counter inflation and efficiently manage costs.Kimberly-Clark’s Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE Program has also worked well. During the third quarter of 2022, the company generated savings of $80 million from the FORCE program, bringing year-to-date program savings to $175 million. Management is maintaining its cost savings from the FORCE program in the range of $300-$350 million in 2022.Apart from this, Kimberly-Clark’s focus on its three key strategic growth pillars bodes well. These include its focus on improving its core business in developed markets, speeding up growth of the Personal Care segment in developing and emerging markets and enhance digital and e-commerce capacities.

This year’s report explores how current economic challenges are affecting consumer snacking choices around the world – with a majority of respondents continuing to prioritize snacking, despite rising costs and economic challenges.Developed in partnership with The Harris Poll, the report tracks snacking attitudes and behaviors among thousands of consumers surveyed across 12 countries for a fourth consecutive year. These findings illustrate the expanded role of snacking– as snacking increasingly replaces traditional meals in consumers' lives. Key findings include that consumers around the world are snacking:Daily - Snacking is a staple – 71 percent of consumers snack at least twice a day.Mindfully - 78 percent of consumers report they take time to savor indulgent snacks with 61 percent saying they take time to portion out snacks before eating them.Frequently - Consumers are increasingly replacing meals with snacks, with 55 percent reporting a higher likelihood to eat a snack across all three standard mealtimes.Sustainably - Reducing waste is a top priority, with seven in 10 consumers saying they prioritize snacks that have less packaging and 72 percent saying they typically recycle it.“Our State of Snacking report confirms that in these trying times, consumers around the world view their favorite snacks as affordable and necessary indulgences,” said Dirk Van de Put, Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz International. “Snacking continues to be a way for consumers to connect or to enjoy a moment of delight in their day, further demonstrating our belief that every snack can be enjoyed in a mindful way.”Story continuesThe survey demonstrates that consumers are looking for snacks to meet different needs in their lives. The vast majority said they regularly snack to reward themselves (78 percent) and for a sense of comfort (77 percent), including an overwhelming majority of millennials (85 percent for both reasons). The current environment also emphasizes the importance of brand recognition, with 67 percent saying they would buy fewer of their favorite snack brands rather than generic alternatives, regardless of cost.The survey complements Mondelēz International’s diverse, proprietary snacking insights knowledge– including macro trends from multiple sources informing the future of snacking and validating the company’s focus on delivering the right snack, for the right moment, made the right way.Additional findings from the 2022 State of Snacking report, available for download at www.mondelezinternational.com/stateofsnacking, include:Mindful snackingConsumers are making an effort to be mindful and present while snacking, with 78 percent reporting they take time to savor indulgent snacks.Many are also tuning into portion sizes, saying they take time to portion out snacks before eating them (61 percent) and check nutrition labels on snacks before buying them (68 percent).Meanwhile, less than half (46 percent) say they feel guilty when enjoying an indulgent snack or treat.A way to connectSnacking offers an important opportunity to connect with others, with seven in 10 confirming, “sharing snacks with others is my love language.”This trend of regularly sitting down to enjoy snacks with loved ones is especially strong among households in India and Mexico.Appetite for sustainabilityConsumers are very focused on how their snacking choices impact the environment – and they recognize that both companies and consumers play key roles in sustainable snacking.63 percent of consumers agree that snacks with a higher environmental impact should cost more, especially millennials (70 percent) and Gen Z (69 percent).64 percent are willing to pay more for snacks that are better for the environment, and 65 percent would pay more for snacks with ethically sourced ingredients.“Today’s consumer is more conscious than ever about their consumption – and that includes health and well-being, as well as the impact on the planet,” said Martin Renaud, Chief Marketing and Sales Officer at Mondelēz International. “The findings of this report continue to help inform our strategy as a global snacking leader with a focus on chocolate and biscuits and a commitment to mindful and sustainable snacking.”About Mondelēz International Mondelēz International, Inc.

THS.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Consumer Staple Stocks Set to Beat This Earnings SeasonThe fourth-quarter 2022 earnings season is gathering pace this week. This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline. A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.However, five consumer staple stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are poised to beat on earnings. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a possible earnings beat should drive their stock prices in the near-term. These companies are - The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Corteva Inc., e.l.f. Beauty Inc., Mondelez International Inc. and TreeHouse Foods Inc..Consumer Staple Sector in Q4 2022Out of the 11 broad sectors of the market's benchmark — the S&amp;P 500 Index — only the energy sector traded in positive territory with a huge rally of 64.2% in 2022. However, among the remaining 10 sectors, consumer staples suffered marginally by declining 0.8% last year while the benchmark itself tumbled 19.4%.The consumer staples sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. The consumer staples sector includes companies that provide necessities and products for daily use. This makes the sector defensive in nature.Story continuesTherefore, this has always been a go-to place for investors, who want to play it safe during extreme market fluctuations irrespective of internal or external disturbances.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) share price is 95% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 13% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 56% in the last three years.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Occidental Petroleum went from making a loss to reporting a profit, in the last year.When a company is just on the edge of profitability it can be well worth considering other metrics in order to more precisely gauge growth (and therefore understand share price movements).We doubt the modest 0.8% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. However the year on year revenue growth of 64% would help. We do see some companies suppress earnings in order to accelerate revenue growth.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Occidental Petroleum stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Occidental Petroleum has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 96% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 0.2% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Occidental Petroleum (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Occidental Petroleum is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

The Dow down 7/10 of a percent. The NASDAQ down a little bit more. The Russell 2000 off an even 1%. I want to start out with crypto here, and this is interesting. Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, reportedly closed out nearly all of its eight-year bet on crypto last year, just before the market started crashing. It's generated $1.8 billion in returns.Now that was in March. In April of last year, Thiel fanned the flames against anti-crypto investors at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami. In that conference, he called Warren Buffett a sociopath grandma and enemy-- grandpa, excuse me, and enemy number one.One month later, in May of 2022, we know that Terra Luna crashed. Now, the crypto winter deepened at that point, and the rest is history. So timing is everything, as they say. But let me just show you what crypto prices have done this year. Pretty interesting to look at that.Now, we've got to shift over to the chip space, and I'm going to get this back on an intraday basis. And we got some news on the export front. The US is cracking down on chips to China, and they may get soon a helping hand from the Netherlands and Japan. Those are two countries that are reportedly close to agreeing to export controls and could be better aligned with the US policy by the end of January.Now, American restrictions already limit exports and also block US citizens from working with these Chinese firms. The Dutch and Japanese measures would simply limit exports-- excuse me. So chipmakers like ASML in the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron in Japan, they would join American companies like Applied Materials, KLA Corp, and Lamb Research in the crackdown. And you can see here, the chip space not necessarily moving on this news today in the afternoon. But let's just take a look at the AMD chart. You can see, been down for pretty much the entire day.All right, we also want to talk about the financial sector. And Capital One, COF, you can see that dark red spot there. That is one of the most red stocks on the day. And there, we are seeing layoffs hitting the financial sector. That's right, the financial sector and also tech all in one. Capital One is eliminating 1,100 tech positions this week. And Bloomberg reporting that employees are invited to apply for other jobs at the bank. Capital One has been heavily invested in technology to improve efficiency, but like many companies recently, is dialing back the headcount.So, with a few seconds to the bell, let me just scroll through some of our sector action today. We had energy in the forefront. That's followed by communication services and healthcare. Those are the only three sectors in the green. To the downside, it is industrials, consumer discretionary, financials, and tech.]"

After all, you probably can’t remember the last time you even went into a bank, so why does it matter if your bank doesn’t have a brick-and-mortar branch?Related: GOBankingRates’ Best Neobanks 2023How To: Protect Your Financial Future With Gold and SilverLearn: 2023’s Housing Correction Could Be the Largest Since Post-WWIIDeposits and transfers can be done online, and that’s what you use your bank for the most, so it seems silly to limit yourself to banks that have physical locations. Financial experts agree, saying there are lots of advantages to a bank that’s all remote. Read what the experts told GOBankingRates and find out their top recommendations for online-only banks.Higher Interest Rates on Savings AccountsWhen you have a savings account with an online bank (also known as a direct bank), you’re probably being treated to higher annual percentage yields (APY). This means your balance will grow faster over time, because the account’s interest rate is higher. Shad Elia, CEO of New England Home Buyers, said this is due to online banks’ lack of significant infrastructure and overhead costs. “The most generous direct banks will offer 1-2% more than traditional bank accounts, a difference that can quickly add up with a large balance.” Elia said.Lower FeesYou’ve probably encountered overdraft fees at a traditional bank. Because of the lack of overhead costs Elia mentioned, this also means online banks are less likely to charge any extra penalty costs that brick and mortar banks do. “At a direct bank, you’re less likely to be charged a variety of fees, including those associated with maintaining an account with a low balance, making direct deposits, or paying by check or debit card. Direct bank accounts are more likely to have no minimum balance requirement or service fees,” Elia said.Take Our Poll: How Big of a Sign-Up Bonus Would It Take for You To Change Banks?ConvenienceHaving control over your bank account at your fingertips makes managing your money significantly easier. “Long gone are the days of waiting in drive-thru lanes or lobby lines,” says President of Battle Financial Frank Trotter. “Today, virtually all your banking needs can be done through your phone, via a mobile app, web browser, or by talking to a live person – whenever, wherever, and however you please.”Story continuesHeightened SecurityMany online banks offer advanced security features that brick-and-mortar branches cannot. “[Online] banks can protect customer data and financial information by using secure encryption and login procedures,” says Alastair Hazell, CEO and Founder of The Calculator Site. “Furthermore, many online banks will notify customers of suspicious activity, providing an extra layer of protection.”Better Online ExperienceTraditional banks are scrambling to create a seamless online experience, but there are still kinks left to work out. If a bank is entirely online, you can bet their grasp on technology is exceptional. This makes for a more intuitive banking experience. “There is a lot of money being spent by traditional banks to improve their online presence and service, including the launch of applications and the upgrading of their websites. The overall online banking experience provided by direct banks, however, appears to be superior,” James Angel, Co-Founder of DYL said.What To Look For When Choosing a BankIf you’re ready to take the plunge and switch to a direct bank, Dennis Shirshikov, Head of Content at Awning says there are a few things you should consider. “It’s important to do your research and compare different online-only banks to find the one that best fits your needs. Look for a bank with a strong reputation, good customer service, and a wide range of products and services that meet your financial goals.”Experts’ Top Choices for Online Banking:Ally Bank: “[Ally] offers a great interest rate, no minimums on savings accounts, and no hidden fees,” Hazell said.Capital One 360: Hazell highlighted “a wide range of banking services and the ability to transfer funds between versions quickly and easily” as advantages of Capital One 360.Simple Bank: “Simple Bank is an excellent choice for those who want an easy-to-use banking app and no additional transaction fees,” Hazell said.Chime: “Another excellent digital-only bank would be Chime, which is great for individuals who have struggled getting checking accounts from traditional banks,” Nerve CEO, John Waupsh said.SoFi: “SoFi is a great resource because they offer a wide range of products and services without ever having to wait in a branch,” Waupsh said.More From GOBankingRatesUnplug These Appliances That Hike Up Your Electricity BillExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Credit Cards for 2023Top Purchases You Should Always Make With a Credit CardThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Experts Reveal Benefits of an Online-Only Bank — and Some Top Choices]"

Data compiled by the National Retail Federation (NRF) showed that holiday retail sales increased 5.3% year over year to $936.3 billion during 2022’s November-December period. However, the numbers came below NRF’s projection of 6% to 8% increase over the 2021 period to between $942.6 billion and $960.4 billion.Nonetheless, stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate still kept demand alive. While inflation-wary shoppers looked for eye-popping deals to fit their budgets, retailers left no stone unturned to make the most of the season.Retailers — be it Casey's General Stores, Inc.’s CASY, The Kroger Co. KR, Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA and Five Below, Inc. FIVE — have been enhancing customer engagement and making logistics improvements to make the most of the festive season.The NRF’s report highlighted a year-over-year increase in sales of myriad categories.

Casey's strength in the Inside category and acquisition activities bode well.This Zacks Rank #1 company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.2%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Casey's current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 23.1% and 18.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period.Kroger, is another lucrative option. The company, which operates in the thin-margin grocery industry, has been undergoing a complete makeover with respect to products and how consumers prefer shopping. The company has been adding new products as well as eyeing technological expansion to enhance its omnichannel reach.

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Ulta Beauty (ULTA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ULTA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Ulta Beauty's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Ulta Beauty's main business drivers.Bolingbrook, IL-based, Ulta Beauty Inc., previously known as Ulta Salon, Cosmetics &amp; Fragrance, Inc., is a leading beauty retailer in the United States. Founded in 1990, the company changed its name to Ulta Beauty in January 2017.The company offers a wide range of products including cosmetics, fragrance, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores. It sells more than 25,000 products from about 500 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points. We note that the company's skincare category has been standing out in particular for a while now, given consumers' rising consciousness.Meanwhile, the beauty products retailer also provides private label products comprising Ulta Beauty Collection branded cosmetics, skincare, and bath products. Additionally, the company operates a full-service salon in every store offering hair, skin and brow services. Additionally, it offers products through its Website, ulta.com, as well as mobile applications. The products offered by the company include the prestige and mass beauty brands.As part of its value proposition, Ulta Beauty provides a range of loyalty programs through its Customer Relationship Management platform. It also offers frequent promotions, coupons, in-store events and gifts. The company also makes use of a range of media platforms to advertise products as well as generate awareness. The company strives to boost distribution center capabilities to better support store footfall and online demand.Story continuesThe company has a strong vendor base and holds partnerships with companies such as Estee Lauder, L’Oréal and Shiseido. Ulta Beauty works closely with vendors to provide improved growth platforms for new and existing brands.As of Oct 29, 2022, Ulta Beauty operated 1,343 stores. For fiscal 2022, the company expects 47 net new stores and 33 store remodeling and relocation projects.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Ulta Beauty, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in January 2013 would be worth $5,303.64, or a 430.36% gain, as of January 19, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 164.40% and the price of gold went up 8.41% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for ULTA.Ulta Beauty has outpaced the industry in the past three months. The company has been benefiting from its omnichannel strength, especially buy online, pickup in store. Also, the skin care category has been gaining from consumers’ rising interest in self-care and the company’s product newness. These upsides aided third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company witnessed growth in all major categories, and all its store and digital channels. Ulta Beauty also saw a higher market share in prestige beauty compared with the year-ago period. Considering the third-quarter performance and anticipations for the fourth quarter, management raised its fiscal 2022 view. However, it expects SG&amp;A deleverage and increased supply-chain costs to persist in fiscal 2022.The stock is up 10.57% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 14 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

399,0ac69520-8a20-303e-8f29-a2fa6a420691,TXT,2023-01-20,Northrop Grumman (NOC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-grumman-noc-reports-next-150103789.html,1674140463,STORY,"['NOC', 'TXT']","[Northrop Grumman (NOC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10%.Revenues are expected to be $9.66 billion, up 11.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.71% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northrop Grumman?For Northrop Grumman, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Northrop Grumman will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Northrop Grumman would post earnings of $6.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.89, delivering a surprise of -3.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Northrop Grumman appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsTextron (TXT), another stock in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.01 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +7.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.67 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Textron has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.14%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

LUV had to cancel in excess of 16,700 flights in the Dec 21-Dec 31, 2022, timeframe due to the inclement weather.The mass cancellations are likely to have dented the company's fourth-quarter 2022 performance. Following the massive cancellations, LUV expects available seat miles (a measure of capacity) to decline approximately 6% in fourth-quarter 2022 from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. The previous guidance hinted at a 2% decline in available seat miles for fourth-quarter 2022.Revenues are likely to be adversely impacted by $400-$425 million. Following the massive flight cancellations, management expects a pre-tax hit of $725-$825 million to fourth-quarter earnings.However, LUV’s focus on boosting cargo revenues is likely to have aided its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.

No change to text.)By Jessica DiNapoli and Richa NaiduNEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Top advertisers on Twitter slashed their spending after Elon Musk's takeover, according to estimates compiled for Reuters by research firm Pathmatics, in the latest shock to the company's dominant revenue source.Fourteen of the top 30 advertisers on Twitter stopped all advertising on the platform after Musk took charge on October 27, according to the Pathmatics estimates. Four advertisers reduced spending between 92% and 98.7% from the week before Musk's acquisition through the end of the year.Overall, advertising spending by the top 30 companies fell by 42% to an estimated $53.8 million for November and December combined, according to Pathmatics, despite an increase in spending by six of them.Pathmatics said the previously unreported figures on Twitter advertising are estimates. The firm bases its estimates on technologies that track ads on desktop browsers and the Twitter app as well as those that mimic user experience.But the company said those estimates do not account for deals advertisers may receive from Twitter, or promoted trends and accounts. ""It is possible the spending data could be higher for some brands"" if Twitter is offering incentives, Pathmatics said in an email.Twitter did not respond to multiple requests for comment.In a November event on Twitter Spaces, Musk, addressing the issue of companies pausing ads, said that he understands if advertisers ""want to give it a minute.""

HBO spokesperson Chris Willard did not comment on the specifics of advertising spending, but said ""we will be assessing the platform under its new leadership and determine appropriate next steps.""Among consumer brands, Heinz ketchup maker Kraft Heinz Co and Stouffers meal manufacturer Nestle SA stopped all advertising, according to the Pathmatics estimates.

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.76%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.76%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 10.92%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest beverage maker had lost 6.25% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 1.12% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.18% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Coca-Cola as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 14, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Coca-Cola to post earnings of $0.45 per share. This would mark no growth from the year-ago period. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $9.96 billion, up 5.27% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.71% higher. Coca-Cola is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In terms of valuation, Coca-Cola is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 23.49. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.56.Meanwhile, KO's PEG ratio is currently 3.77. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. KO's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.7 as of yesterday's close.Story continuesThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 15, which puts it in the top 6% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

412,c1490b4d-73c9-3987-8768-b059e46d060d,WY,2023-01-20,Earnings Preview: Weyerhaeuser (WY) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-weyerhaeuser-wy-q4-150003838.html,1674140403,STORY,['WY'],"[Weyerhaeuser (WY) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis timber and paper products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -63.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.88 billion, down 14.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Weyerhaeuser?For Weyerhaeuser, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -15.73%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Weyerhaeuser will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Weyerhaeuser would post earnings of $0.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.42, delivering a surprise of +2.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Weyerhaeuser doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.76%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.76%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 10.92%.Heading into today, shares of the garbage and recycling hauler had lost 5.26% over the past month, lagging the Business Services sector's gain of 4.58% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.18% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Waste Management as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 1, 2023. On that day, Waste Management is projected to report earnings of $1.42 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 12.7%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $4.98 billion, up 6.41% from the prior-year quarter.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Waste Management should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% higher. Waste Management is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Waste Management is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 24.35.

Campaign Manager will be available to Mailchimp customers with Standard and Premium plans worldwide on January 25th.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230119005292/en/Campaign Manager gives marketers a holistic view of their campaigns in Mailchimp. (Photo: Business Wire)With Campaign Manager (patent pending), a Mailchimp customer can bring all of their marketing activity happening within a designated period into the same space in a way that can help marketers track what’s happening, plan ahead, and make adjustments along the way. Marketers who are building omni-channel experiences are likely to be building these experiences using, on average, 7 martech tools that manage marketing tactics like SMS, social ads, loyalty programs, customer support interactions, and more. Campaign Manager enables users to see all associated campaign activities at a glance—like special events, limited-time promotions, holiday activations, seasonal campaigns, and more—and gives recommendations on the best days to plan marketing touchpoints based on industry benchmarks. These recommendations are generated from millions of data points analyzed by Mailchimp.""Omni-channel experiences are critical for marketing to modern consumers, and our marketer customers have shared the recurring pain of creating and managing these experiences across channels and tools,"" said Jon Fasoli, Chief Product and Design Officer at Intuit Mailchimp. ""We designed Campaign Manager to give them a single tool to plan, automate and analyze their campaigns across channels and marketing tools.""Story continuesSMS and more with webhooksMarketers and small business owners can now trigger actions in their third-party apps using webhooks—a custom HTTP callback that is triggered by an event—in Campaign Manager for even more robust multichannel campaign planning. Setting up webhooks in Campaign Manager can help marketers work more efficiently by allowing them to update a spreadsheet, send a status update to customers, or add customers to paid social media ads. Marketers can connect their third-party SMS provider and then use webhooks to send campaigns, like sharing a holiday coupon code through a text message.Key features of Campaign Manager include:Campaign setup: Set your objective, so you can track performance against your overarching goalCampaign calendar: Access a single source of truth to see all individual activities associated with your campaign, including marketing touchpoints, tasks to complete, and important milestone datesMultichannel marketing: Create individual marketing touchpoints associated with the campaign, starting with Mailchimp’s email tool. And expand your campaigns to multiple channels with webhooks, allowing you to schedule activities in third-party apps for text messaging/SMS, ads, social media, direct mail, and more — all set up and managed from the same campaign calendar.Recommendations: As you schedule new marketing touchpoints, Mailchimp will suggest the best dates during your campaign period to send your individual emails based on AI modeling of your industry and outcomes from millions of other emails sent in Mailchimp.Analytics: View holistic analytics for your campaign, taking into account your campaign objectives. Understand in aggregate how your campaign is performing, and view the impact that individual touchpoints are having on your goals to understand your best-performing marketing. Customize your view to prioritize the metrics that matter most to your business.Mailchimp customer Tigrilla Gardenia is a nature-inspired mentor and leadership coach, whose career has spanned from program management in technology to circus performance, marketing, and now plant-inspired mentorship for ""naturepreneurs."" She first used Campaign Manager during its private beta to plan and manage campaigns ahead of a summit and product re-launch.""Overall, I find Campaign Manager to be super helpful to keep your campaigns focused. I liked being able to see everything together. I love that Campaign Manager gives you the best date to email within a range of time,"" said Tigrilla Gardenia. ""The way that I work right now is that my team comes up with our general marketing themes based on where we're headed for the near future. So we sit down, and we're like, ‘Okay, these are the major areas that we want to touch on for the next 2 months,’ and then they might lay out the social media direction that they want to do with that and I'll write the email newsletters. So if I could take what the overarching messaging endpoints are, overlap that onto a schedule rather than having them separate, it would be great. Because then I could just go into Mailchimp and say, ‘Okay, I'm going to write a message about this, and these are the times that I want to connect with my audience,’ and then I can do that all in one place. I would definitely continue to use it to keep from drafting my marketing copy and emails in separate places.""To learn more about Campaign Manager, go to mailchimp.com/help/about-campaign-manager.

Consumer Price Index may seemingly bode well for costs-of-living dynamics, inflation-fighting stocks to buy is still a good idea. For one thing, it’s probably not wise to make wholesale strategy changes based on a month’s worth of data. Second, the money supply expanded dramatically, meaning much work needs to be done for containment. Therefore, investors shouldn’t give up on inflation-fighting stocks to buy.Moving forward, it’s anyone’s guess what will happen this year. Indeed, with so many wild events erupting in the last three years, few experts will want to stick their neck out. That’s why dividend-paying companies enjoy significant relevance right now, including these inflation-fighting stocks.CLColgate-Palmolive$77.85SRESempra Energy$160.83PSXPhillips 66$103.03IBMIBM.$145.89PMPhilip Morris$101.70VZVerizon$41.86BHPBHP GroupInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsColgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comAs a candidate for inflation-fighting stocks to buy, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) makes sense. The personal care giant carries a forward yield of 2.41%, beating out the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. While it’s not the most generous payout, the company also features 60 years of consecutive dividend increases.Fundamentally, Colgate-Palmolive benefits from inelastic demand. Essentially, people should usually aim to brush their teeth three times a day, along with flossing at least once a day. More than likely, a recession won’t change this regimen. Should people skip a dental appointment or two, they’ll still be brushing their teeth.According to analysts, CL rates as a consensus moderate buy. Among 12 experts, five of them rate CL a buy while the rest say hold. Nevertheless, generally rising exposure among hedge funds – even though the immediate sentiment may be negative – could be a good sign moving forward.Story continuesSempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for inflation-fighting stocks to buy, you probably can’t go wrong with public utilities. Undergirding the necessary services that modern societies need, these entities enjoy practically permanent demand. Specifically, Southern California’s Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) may be one of the best ideas for mitigating rising prices.For one thing, Sempra features a forward yield of 2.85%. To be fair, it’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. However, the company enjoys 18 years of annual consecutive dividend increases. And while its payout ratio isn’t low, at almost 48%, it’s certainly not the highest ratio you’ll see. That’s good for sustainability.Secondly, Sempra strongly benefits from geography. Namely, California represents the U.S. economy’s powerhouse, generating a $3.4 trillion GDP. Per the Los Angeles Times, the Golden State might also become the world’s fourth-largest economy. Whether you like it or not, Sempra is here to stay, making it one of the more compelling inflation-fighting stocks.Phillips 66 (PSX)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockWhile the above two enterprises enjoy reliable and dependable demand structures, we’re also talking about mitigating rising prices. In other words, inflation-fighting stocks to buy should feature more robust payouts. Fortunately, energy giant Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) helps deliver such passive income. At time of writing, the company carries a forward yield of 3.77%.To be sure, critics might point out that this payout slips lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. As well, the company only has two years of consecutive dividend increases. Still, Phillips 66 deserves consideration as one of the inflation-fighting stocks in part because of its payout ratio. At 31.23%, it’s a low and therefore credible metric.Fundamentally, Phillips 66 should benefit from social normalization trends, particularly in the workplace. As major corporations put an end to remote work for all five business days of the week, commuting volume will rise. That should be very helpful for PSX, where the underlying firm specializes in the downstream (refining and marketing) component of the energy value chain.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVAlthough IBM (NYSE:IBM) plies its trade in the exciting technology sector, Big Blue itself isn’t very interesting. For longer than it probably cares to admit, the company held onto legacy businesses that suffered from fading relevancies. Still, with key strategic shifts and acquisitions, IBM now represents a quiet outperformer. For instance, in the trailing year, shares gained almost 10% of equity value.Regarding the topic of inflation-fighting stocks, IBM currently carries a forward yield of 4.52%. This metric ranks well above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the company enjoys 29 years of consecutive dividend increases. While its payout ratio rings a little warm at 66.1%, it’s not the hottest stat ever.Plus, IBM enjoys significant relevancies. Yes, we may be hurtling toward a global recession. But that’s not going to stop tech firms from innovating. Along with its artificial intelligence unit, IBM commands significant relevancies with its enterprise-level cybersecurity services. Therefore, Big Blue will probably make good as one of the inflation-fighting stocks to buy.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comWith Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), this company represents an example of not shooting the messenger. Understandably, some folks may take issue with the company as it makes up the ranks of global big tobacco. At the same time, I write for a broad audience. Therefore, it’s not my right to presume the sensibilities of everyone. Even those who may have hesitancies with PM will find it difficult to ignore the passive income. Currently, Philip Morris features a forward yield of 5%. Again, the consumer staple sector’s average yield sits at 1.89%. As well, PM enjoys 14 years of dividend increases, a trend I’m sure management will want to sustain.Regarding the fundamentals, globally, smoking prevalence declined, which doesn’t seem to support Philip Morris. However, many people still do enjoy their adult liberties and they’re choosing e-cigarettes or vaporizers. Philip Morris invested in this relatively new platform, making it an intriguing (though controversial) idea among inflation-fighting stocks.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockTo be fully transparent, if you want a more conservative approach with your inflation-fighting stocks, you should consider some of the names above. With Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the narrative admittedly becomes incredibly tricky. For one thing, you’re looking at a rather steep market loss, shedding almost 22% in the trailing year.From another angle, the company arguably deserves the fallout. In large part due to Verizon’s aggressive marketing initiatives in 2021, the volatility of the following year hurt VZ stock. As a result, Verizon encountered analyst criticism and pessimism.Though distracting, it’s also fair to point out that investors hard hit with rising prices might give the telecom giant another look. That’s because Verizon offers a forward yield of 6.24%. Notably, the communication sector’s average yield sits at a comparatively low 2.62%. Moreover, Verizon enjoys 18 years of consecutive dividend increases. On a final note, the company currently enjoys a moderate buy consensus view. Therefore, if you want to take a shot, you won’t be the only one.BHP (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockIf you really want to take your inflation-fighting stocks to the next level, then you may want to consider metals and mining firm BHP (NYSE:BHP). For starters, the Australian stalwart represented one of the few winners of 2022. And in the trailing year, BHP gained nearly 17% of equity value. Indeed, near-term sentiment rates strongly, with shares soaring almost 41% in the past half-year period.Fundamentally, geopolitical flashpoints crimped global supplies of critical resources. Therefore, western-friendly countries such as Australia will play a more vital role in international commerce. Specific to BHP, the company specializes in many critical resources, such as copper and nickel. Both feature heavily in advanced solutions such as electric vehicles.Of course, probably the biggest reason why some investors may look to BHP as one of the inflation-fighting stocks to buy is the payout. Commanding a forward yield of 10.1%, stakeholders could be getting passive income superior to some stocks’ annual market returns. However, the downside is that the payout ratio stands at a stratospheric 127.2%. Still, because of increased fundamental relevance, BHP remains intriguing.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The turbine technology will allow GE's existing 6F.03, 7F and 9F gas turbines to safely burn up to 100% ammonia. It may also be implemented across General Electric’s other gas turbines in the time to come. In June 2021, GE and IHI had signed an MOU to conduct an economic assessment for the use of ammonia as a carbon-free fuel for both existing and new gas turbines.  GE’s expertise in engineering and manufacturing gas turbine combustors together with IHI’s ammonia combustion technology competence will enable the power plant operators to use carbon-free fuels such as ammonia for power generation in their GE gas turbines. This will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector worldwide.

429,51b5a719-14ab-321c-b404-c9f8dd99e536,VLO,2023-01-20,Valero Energy (VLO) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-vlo-earnings-expected-150003513.html,1674140403,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +193.5%.Revenues are expected to be $40.97 billion, up 14.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.89% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Valero Energy?For Valero Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Valero Energy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Valero Energy would post earnings of $7 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.14, delivering a surprise of +2%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Valero Energy appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

430,2ea190a4-477c-3c50-9a65-7d64b439d2c4,VLO,2023-01-20,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-valero-energy-140002523.html,1674136802,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil refiner have returned +10.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.2% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has gained 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $7.25 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +193.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.09 points to a change of +899.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +11.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.24 indicates a change of -28% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Valero Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $175.61 billion and $151.6 billion estimates indicate +54.1% and -13.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $44.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +50.6%. EPS of $7.14 for the same period compares with $1.22 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.94%. The EPS surprise was +2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's the full list, as covered in real time on InvestingPro. Sign up to get this news first.Netflix climbs following Q4 reportNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) said fourth quarter global streaming paid net additions grew 7.66 million, well ahead of its 4.5M estimate, due to both strong acquisition and retention, and driven primarily by the success of its Q4 content slate. EPS came in at $0.12, compared with the consensus estimate of $0.59, while revenue was $7.85B (up 2% year-over-year), just above consensus.For Q1, the company expects revenue of $8.172B (up 4% year-over-year), better than the $8.15B consensus, though expected EPS of $2.82 is lower than the $2.97 average estimate. The company expects to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1, anticipating it to result in a very different quarterly paid net adds pattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2 than in Q1.Netflix also announced that Reed Hastings stepped down as a co-CEO to take on the role of executive chairman. Former COO Greg Peters is now Ted Sarandos' co-CEO and a member of the Netflix board.Shares were recently up more than 5% pre-market.Procter &amp; Gamble sales hit by strong U.S. dollarProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) shares closed down more than 2% after the company said Q2 sales dropped due to the strong U.S. dollar, which it says negatively impacted international demand for the company's consumer goods.Net sales, which take into account foreign exchange and acquisitions, decreased by 1% from a year earlier to $20.8B in Q2. The company, which earns more than half of its revenue from outside the U.S., stated that an ""unfavorable"" foreign exchange environment had a 6% effect on net sales. Still, the number was slightly better than the consensus estimate of $20.74B. Q2 EPS came in at $1.59, compared with the consensus estimate of $1.58.Story continuesThe company raised its fiscal 2023 all-in sales growth guidance to a range of (1%)-0% from the prior (3%)-(1%). The company maintained its 2023 diluted EPS growth guidance in the range of 0-4% versus fiscal 2022 EPS of $5.81.Bad tidings at NordstromNordstrom (NYSE:JWN) was off some 6% in the pre-market after the company said sales dropped 3.5% for the nine-week holiday period ended December 31, 2022, compared with the nine weeks ended January 1, 2022. For the Nordstrom banner chain, net sales decreased 1.7 percent, while net sales at the Nordstrom off-price Rack chain decreased 7.6 percent.Kohl's Corp. (NYSE:KSS) and Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) both lost ground on the news.Rounding out yesterday's earnings newsWeWork Inc. (NYSE:WE) said yesterday it expects to report Q4 revenue above forecast and a narrower fall in EBITDA. It had forecasted revenue in the range of $870-890M and adjusted EBITDA in the range of minus $85-65M. The company also announced it plans to cut approximately 300 jobs in its global workforce. Shares closed down more than 3%.Allstate (NYSE:ALL) shares plunged more than 5% following the company's reported preliminary Q4 results, estimating a net loss of $285-335M, with an adjusted estimated net loss of $335-385M.Unfavorable prior-year reserve estimates totaled $282M, excluding catastrophes. According to BofA Securities, which cut its price target to $148 from $154, this is likely the most disappointing item from the pre-announcement. ""Following a corrective prior-year charge of $875mn in 3Q22, investors and the Street were hoping to have the recent strengthening in the rearview mirror,"" the firm added.***If you're interested in upgrading your search for new investing ideas, check out InvestingPro.Related Articles5 big earnings reports: Netflix jumps on subscriber beatLittle room for gloom at Dublin's Davos for aircraft financiersNordstrom shares fall after 'unsuprising' guidance cut]"

The brand’s founding couple said the acquisition will help the brand expand its reach to customers, scale nonprofit efforts with Mielle Cares, and help fund additional economic opportunities for Black and Brown communities.However, amid news of the acquisition, there are growing concerns and complaints from consumers who fear P&amp;G taking control of the brand might lessen the quality of the brand known for its all-natural approach to haircare.“Mielle Organics is about to get gentrified and I am NOT OK,” one user tweeted.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.“Better buy now before the formula changes,” said someone else.“I’m not looking forward to spending too much time and a small fortune on a bunch of wasted hair products looking for a replacement,” added another consumer.Amid the upset reactions from beauty consumers, founder Necole Kane, who stepped down from XoNecole to run her plant-based supplement company, sent out a series of tweets to defend Mielle Organics and shed light on the struggle for founders to sell a company they created.“In the wake of all the talk around Mielle Organics, I just want to say, no one ever talks about the grief you experience as a founder when you sell a business,” Kane wrote.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.“I’ve built three brands.

The Dow closing off just over 250 points. S&amp;P and NASDAQ also in the red, with the NASDAQ off just about 1% in today's trading day. S&amp;P off just about 7/10 of a percent. Let's take a look at some of the top movers of the day. Let's start with Roblox, shares closing lower this afternoon following a call from Morgan Stanley. They downgraded the stock to underweight with the firm expecting slower bookings growth in the second half of the year and little upside from advertising in the near term. We're looking at losses of just about 6 and 1/2%, so Roblox closing off its lows of the day.But that good news that we have gotten in Roblox recently, the reacceleration that we're expected to see in the first half when it comes to bookings, Morgan Stanley making the case today that that has already been priced into the stock. Goldman maintaining Roblox at a sell. They lowered their price target to 19 from 24. So it looks like the second half of the year could be pretty challenging for Roblox.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, at the open today, the stock was up 28% year to date. So Matthew [INAUDIBLE] really looking at it and saying that's pretty much peak. Not going to get a lot better than that coming off a holiday season, a December that they expected to be successful. Still, though, at this point, when you look at the analyst, 15 buys, 10 holds, 8 sells. So still some bullish thoughts on Roadblox-- on Roblox. You've got to think the gaming sector been pulling back and, as they believe, Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive are the ones that they would bet on.Let's talk Procter &amp; Gamble. Those shares today, if we could put up the stock chart there, closing, yep, down a little over 2% after earnings prior to the bell, the company beat Street earnings expectations on the top and bottom line, but reported year over year declines in revenue and profit for the second quarter. They raised prices 10% in the quarter.Story continuesAnd largely, what they're saying is, well, demand dropped off. They raised them 9% the prior quarter. Question-- do you think this is a positive Fed story? If you're seeing a company that raised their prices that high, and demand dropped off, is that exactly what Jerome Powell wants to see?SEANA SMITH: I think what needs to happen, right, in order for the Fed to reach some of their goals, so I guess if you want to take an optimistic view, looking at these results, which were disappointing, I guess this is what the Fed needs to see in order for us to continue to get inflation under control. But when it comes to Procter &amp; Gamble, they're in a pretty tough spot. You mentioned that 10% price hike that we've gotten in the latest quarter. They're saying they are going to keep raising prices to help offset those higher costs in the first half of this year.Beauty product prices increased by an average of 9%. Fabric and home care prices up 13%. We know China a big part of Procter &amp; Gamble's business. They are optimistic about the reopening there. They do expect consumption to rebound, what they're saying in the mid-single digits. But of course, as you and I have talked about time and time again, the reopening there with the surge in cases, the timing of that reopening is pretty uncertain at this point. And that's something that Procter &amp; Gamble is taking into account. They did, though, raise their sales forecast on those price hikes.DAVE BRIGGS: They also improved their market share here in the US by, albeit a slight amount, they improved their market share 0.5% here in the US. Echoes what we said yesterday with staples names just getting hammered across the board yesterday. And basically all those same names-- Kraft Heinz, Campbell's Soup, Conagra, et cetera, et cetera-- essentially flat today.All right, let's take a look at some of the big EV auto stocks, Rivian and Lucid. You can see Rivian down more than 4% on the day, both trending on the Yahoo Finance website today and taking a hit lower. A note out from Deutsche Bank predicting several companies could miss quarterly consensus estimates and slashing their Rivian price target from 43 down to 28.So it's not just Tesla. Everyone talks about Tesla having lost 65% of their market cap last year. These other names and what-- really, when you look-- step back, these names blew first mover advantage. Rivian had it and specifically when it comes to pickups and SUVs.And it may not have been their fault. It may have been the timing of COVID. It may have been the supply chains that, quite simply, broke down. But their chief advantage was first mover. And now you've got GM and Ford and everybody moving into that space, and their advantage squandered.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly is going to be a tough road here when you keep into account that the Fed is going to continue to raise rates. We heard from Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, coming out time and time again, saying how that is-- how higher rates do hurt their company. He came out tweeting that Fed rate increases make cars more expensive for consumers, increasing difficulty level for automotive companies.Rivian today hitting the lowest level that we have ever seen. Deutsche Bank lowering their price target on the stock. They're certainly seeing some further losses ahead. When you take a look at how far these stocks that have fallen--DAVE BRIGGS: Ugh.SEANA SMITH: --from their peak--DAVE BRIGGS: Rivian!SEANA SMITH: --off over 90%, both Rivian and Lucid peaking back in November 2021. They weren't public for that long before we certainly did see that peak. And that one-year chart that we have up on the screen right now, off just over 77%. So it's certainly going to be a tough road for this group, and just looking at the losses today, with Lucid off another 8.7%.DAVE BRIGGS: Rivian at a market cap of $150 billion at their peak. They had no revenue. That, of course, was the problem. And now slide the decimal over. They're worth 14.5. All right, we're awaiting these Netflix earnings. We'll have them for you as soon as they break. But it's already been a busy day in the streaming space.Saudi-backed start-up LIV Golf announcing a broadcast deal earlier with the CW. 75% of the CW is owned by Nexstar, which bought into the new golf league while everyone stayed away. And this is essentially a two-year deal. No money will they get from actually rights fees. This is basically an ad share, a revenue ad share. So it's not a great deal for LIV Golf. It's a great deal for the CW who doesn't have to buy these rights.But it's been a pretty good start to the year before we get to Netflix for Warner Brothers Discovery, for Paramount, for Disney. There is some optimism in the space.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, there certainly is a lot of optimism in this space for Warner Brothers Discovery. Goldman coming out earlier this month naming it its favorite media stock for 2023, and here's why. They're seeing the catalyst as the recent merger-- streaming merger milestones that they have reached. Also their upcoming streaming relaunch in the spring.We certainly have seen significant gains in Warner Brothers Discovery since the start of the year and a number of upgrades for Netflix over the last several months. Jeffrey recently upgraded Netflix on its ad tier optimism. And Goldman Sachs boosting its estimates here as we get these earnings results from Netflix amid the weaker dollar. So maybe that could be a positive sign here, a positive move for Netflix ahead of these results.DAVE BRIGGS: One last positive thing in the streaming industry--SEANA SMITH: What's that?DAVE BRIGGS: ""Ted Lasso"" finally teased.SEANA SMITH: Your favorite.DAVE BRIGGS: Good Lord, Apple, teasing it.SEANA SMITH: We're counting down the time for that.DAVE BRIGGS: Season 3 coming in the spring. We've been desperately waiting]"

The company will now pay 37.5 cents per share in dividends from 53 cents paid out earlier. The reduced dividend will be paid out on Feb 10 to common shareholders of record as of Jan 30, 2023.VNO noted that the dividend cut is “in recognition of the current state of the economy and capital markets.” The company’s reduced projection for 2023 taxable income mainly due to higher interest expenses resulted in the dividend cut.Although Vornado has a portfolio of top-quality office spaces located in a few select, high-rent, high-barrier-to-entry markets of New York, Chicago and San Francisco, a choppy office market environment is likely to affect its leasing volume in the near term.Intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estates, including sublease space available from its tenants, is likely to curb Vornado’s ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents. Rising interest rates amid an inflationary environment are expected to add to the company’s woes.Earlier, the pandemic-led business disruptions had resulted in lower rental income and occupancy erosion at its properties, leading to lower cash flow available for distribution.In July 2020, the company made a 19.7% sequential reduction in its quarterly dividend to 53 cents per share amid uncertainties caused by the pandemic and continued this payout. The company paid out a quarterly cash dividend of 66 cents per share prior to that dividend cut.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 5.6% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 14%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties Inc.

Price and EPS Surprise American Airlines Group Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Airlines Group Inc. price-eps-surprise | American Airlines Group Inc. QuoteGiven this backdrop, let's delve deeper to unearth the factors that are likely to have influenced AAL’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance.We expect upbeat air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, to have boosted American Airlines’ top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Driven by the uptick, AAL expects fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted operating margin to increase 10.25-10.5% (prior view: 5.5-7.5%). Total revenues are expected to register 16-17% growth (prior view: 11-13% growth rate).Passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of the top line, are likely to have been high, in turn, boosting the top line. Fourth-quarter total revenue per available seat mile is expected to be up almost 24% versus the fourth quarter of 2019 (prior view: up 18-20%). The presence of the Thanksgiving holiday period during the fourth quarter is likely to have boosted passenger volumes. Driven by upbeat traffic, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is likely to have been impressive in the December-end quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for load factor is pegged at 84% for fourth-quarter 2022, higher than the 80% reported in fourth-quarter 2019. However, high operating costs are anticipated to have affected the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.  AAL expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.12-$1.17.What Our Model SaysOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for AAL this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesAmerican Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +16.71% (the Most Accurate Estimate is pinned at 88 cents at present, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is presently pegged at 75 cents) and a Zacks Rank #2.Highlights of Q3American Airlines’ third-quarter 2022 earnings of 69 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents despite higher costs. In the year-ago quarter, AAL incurred a loss of 99 cents per share when air-travel demand was not as bullish as in the present scenario. The third quarter of 2022 was the second consecutive profitable quarter, excluding net special items at AAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $13,462 million skyrocketed 50.1% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,457.5 million. This year-over-year jump reflects upbeat air-travel demand. Buoyant air-travel demand is also reflected by the total operating revenue increase of 13% from the third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels despite operating at 9.6% lower capacity.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider as well, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to beat on their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings.JetBlue Airways JBLU currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.77% and a Zacks Rank #3. JBLU will release results on Jan 26.We expect upbeat air-travel demand to have aided JBLU’s fourth-quarter performance. However, high costs are likely to have been a dampener.Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC has an Earnings ESP of +1.42% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. NSC will release results on Jan 25.We expect the upbeat demand scenario to have aided NSC’s fourth-quarter performance.

450,e222eae9-400e-3ca1-911e-4679ab843e06,AAL,2023-01-20,Alaska Air Group (ALK) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alaska-air-group-alk-earnings-150003679.html,1674140403,STORY,"['ALK', 'AAL']","[The market expects Alaska Air Group (ALK) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +266.7%.Revenues are expected to be $2.5 billion, up 31.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 57.14% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alaska Air?For Alaska Air, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alaska Air will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alaska Air would post earnings of $2.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.53, delivering a surprise of +4.98%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Alaska Air doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, American Airlines (AAL) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.75 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +152.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $12.84 billion, up 36.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for American Airlines has been revised 100.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 16.71%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that American Airlines will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. Though high-interest rates challenge most sectors of the economy, certain industries benefit from this particular environment. For example, the financial sector becomes one of the top choices for investors because of its growing profit margins. Similarly, energy, consumer goods, and retailers stand to benefit as interest rates increase. Moreover, analysts recommend loading up on dividend securities as they can maintain their share prices and generate stable income for shareholders.Over the years, dividend stocks have exhibited strong performance in high-interest rate periods. According to a report by Global X, high-dividend stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rates periods from 1960 to 2017. The report also mentioned that half of the high-dividend stocks’ returns came from dividend payments during this period. When investing in dividend stocks, economists recommend companies with proven dividend growth track records, as these stocks have the potential for value appreciation. From May 2005 to April 2015, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index, as reported by ProShares. The report also cited Bloomberg’s data and mentioned that in high-interest rates years during this period, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, significantly surpassing the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index, which returned 8.5%.During a turbulent market, dividend stocks contribute to portfolio returns for the long term. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividend equities are an ideal form of investment for long-term investors as high-dividend stocks are at their best when inflation is above normal levels but starting to fall. Some dividend stocks that are on investors’ radars include Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR). However, in this article, we will discuss the best dividend stocks for rising interest rates.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:We scanned Insider Monkey's database of stock holdings of 920 elite hedge funds and picked the top 11 dividend-paying companies that either benefit from higher interest rates or remain unaffected in a rising interest rate environment. These companies operate in sectors like financials, mortgage, energy and consumer goods. Moreover, these companies have strong dividend policies which would help investors to generate stable income in the current market situation.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”10. Visa Inc.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

453,5a20ff75-965b-3895-93b8-c4c2c817306f,SHW,2023-01-20,Sherwin-Williams (SHW) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sherwin-williams-shw-reports-next-150003961.html,1674140403,STORY,['SHW'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Sherwin-Williams (SHW) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +38.1%.Revenues are expected to be $5.25 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.07% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sherwin-Williams?For Sherwin-Williams, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.56%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sherwin-Williams will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sherwin-Williams would post earnings of $2.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.83, delivering a surprise of +8.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Sherwin-Williams doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is witnessing strong architectural sales volumes, which is driving sales in the Americas Group segment. It saw strong demand in the third quarter of 2022 across all professional architectural markets in the Americas Group.The company, in its third-quarter call, said that it sees the strong positive results to continue into the fourth quarter. This is projected to be driven by sustained momentum in the Americas Group and industrial end markets in North America, continued price realization, good cost control and softer year-over-year comparisons. It expects consolidated net sales to increase high-single to low-double digit percentage year over year in the fourth quarter.Sherwin-Williams’ cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement are also expected to provide margin benefits. It is also implementing pricing actions to offset cost inflation, especially in raw materials.The company also remains committed toward expanding its retail operations. It is focused on capturing a larger share of its end-markets, as is evident from increasing number of retail stores. It added 32 net new stores through the first three quarters of 2022 and expects to add 40-50 new stores in the fourth quarter.Sherwin-Williams also has a strong liquidity position and is using its cash strategically. It generated $1.28 billion in net operating cash during the first nine months of 2022. The company also repurchased 2.75 million shares of its common stock during the period. It had remaining authorization to repurchase 45.8 million shares through open market purchases at the end of the third quarter.Story continuesA Few HeadwindsThe company faces headwinds from higher raw material costs. Raw material inflation on a year-over-year basis had an impact on the company’s performance in the third quarter. The impacts of raw material cost inflation are likely to continue in the fourth quarter. The company sees input cost inflation of high-teens percentage for full-year 2022. Sherwin-Williams is also seeing higher labor and transportation costs. Higher costs may exert pressure on the company’s earnings.Demand has also significantly softened in Europe due to the sluggish macroeconomic environment. Moreover, lack of meaningful recovery in China following the lifting of pandemic-led restrictions is also affecting the company. Demand is expected to remain sluggish in Europe and China in the fourth quarter, affecting the company’s volumes.The SherwinWilliams Company Price and Consensus The SherwinWilliams Company Price and ConsensusThe SherwinWilliams Company price-consensus-chart | The SherwinWilliams Company Quote Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Olympic Steel, Inc.

The film was created and produced in partnership with Hello Sunshine, a media company founded by actress Reese Witherspoon, and nearly all (92 per cent) of the primary roles in the making of the film were comprised of women. Viewers can learn more about the making of Rise, here.As an official sponsor of the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, Stacy's Pita Chips will screen the short film at the Stacy's Roots to Rise Market in Park City.

462,cb48985c-95d6-3d39-90e7-40e1532deb26,PEP,2023-01-20,"Down -5.96% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why PepsiCo (PEP) Looks Ripe for a Turnaround",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-5-96-4-weeks-143502876.html,1674138902,STORY,['PEP'],"[A downtrend has been apparent in PepsiCo (PEP) lately with too much selling pressure. The stock has declined 6% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for PEPThe heavy selling of PEP shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 27.76. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering PEP in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, PEP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

464,3e0b194e-dac4-3de6-aa86-80f2e943e794,UNP,2023-01-20,10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-value-stocks-big-buybacks-165833448.html,1674147513,STORY,"['UNP', 'SPGI', 'JNJ', 'NVDA', 'WMT']","[In this article, we take a look at 10 value stocks with big buybacks. If you want to see more value stocks with big buybacks, go directly to 5 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks.Value stocks are stocks that arguably trade below their intrinsic value. Although the intrinsic value of a stock is subjective because different people can have different prices on what they think a stock is worth, many investors view the stocks of high quality companies with long term growth potential and reasonable forward P/E ratios as value stocks.Many high quality companies trade for lower valuations at the beginning of 2023 given the uncertain macroeconomic climate of rising interest rates, high inflation, and a potential recession this year.In 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially and the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates even further this year. If the central bank raises rates too much, there could be a recession that could put pressure on stocks.Nevertheless, if the macroeconomic climate normalizes, valuations could potentially normalize and help the stock prices of many high quality companies in the long term.Some value companies are also companies with big share buybacks.Companies buy back stock to reduce the number of shares outstanding. If they don't issue new stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding could potentially increase their earnings per share if they are profitable and their profits remain the same or rise. If a company's earnings per share rises substantially, its stock could potentially benefit if its price to earnings valuation remains the same.Share buybacks have the advantage of being more flexible than dividends in terms of their timing. While dividends are usually but not necessarily periodic, share buybacks don't have a set schedule.Share buybacks have historically also been more tax advantageous than dividends.While inflation and interest rates will eventually normalize, 2023 could be a volatile year like 2022. If economic data fails to meet estimates, there could be more downside for both the market and value stocks before macroeconomic conditions normalize. As a result, it could be a good idea to own a diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks, we used preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data for Q3 2022 from the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we selected 10 stocks from the list of top 20 buyback stocks that arguably trade below their long term intrinsic value.We ranked the stocks by the amount of buybacks they did in the third quarter per the preliminary S&amp;P 500 stock buyback data.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database which held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks10.

466,3fc3840a-5b61-30fe-aad2-92489b75095b,AMP,2023-01-20,Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) Is Up 3.70% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-services-amp-3-170005960.html,1674147605,STORY,['AMP'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ameriprise Financial Services currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if AMP is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this financial services company holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor AMP, shares are up 3.7% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry is up 2.46% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.85% compares favorably with the industry's 5.47% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Ameriprise Financial Services have increased 12.2% over the past quarter, and have gained 5.25% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 6.04% and -12.82%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to AMP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. AMP is currently averaging 385,280 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with AMP.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AMP's consensus estimate, increasing from $24.37 to $24.54 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that AMP is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Ameriprise Financial Services on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

467,14aac99d-4987-333c-a117-4dae06f5f9e3,AMP,2023-01-20,Federated Hermes (FHI) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federated-hermes-fhi-reports-next-150003156.html,1674140403,STORY,"['FHI', 'AMP']","[The market expects Federated Hermes (FHI) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 26, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis one of the nation's largest managers of money market funds is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.6%.Revenues are expected to be $381.41 million, up 18.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Federated Hermes?For Federated Hermes, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Federated Hermes will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Federated Hermes would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.78, delivering a surprise of +13.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

And again, all week, we've been talking to some of the biggest names in business. And one of those big names is Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins. Here's what he told us on tech layoffs and who he's been meeting here on the ground.CHUCK ROBBINS: I've met with lots of CEOs. I've met with a couple of heads of state. I've met with the first lady of Ukraine. I've met with Vice Premier Liu He. And it's funny because publicly, in the press, everybody wants to talk about whether we're going to a recession or not. When we go into our meetings, we generally don't talk about that. There's a lot of discussions around Ukraine. Obviously, there's a lot of discussion around geopolitical issues. There's a lot of discussions around inflation in general, the energy crisis. And but I think overall, I sense there's still more optimism here than what's sort of being portrayed relative to this fear of a recession.BRIAN SOZZI: You met-- in the meeting with China's vice premier, what are some of your takeaways there? Is it-- is that relationship between the US and China as fragmented as we all make it out to be?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, my takeaway is that after Xi and Biden met at the G20, it feels like both sides are at least going to begin some discussions again on some really important topics. And the vice premier actually talked about that while he was here. So his messaging with us was quite similar to his public messaging here. So I'm optimistic because the uncertainty is what-- is the problem out there.And I think that, look, we're going to compete. They know we're-- they're going to compete. We're going to compete. But we need to find a way. There's some issues that we need China and the US to agree on and work together on, like climate. But there are areas where we'll obviously compete. But we need to find a way to do it in a way that doesn't destabilize the global economy. And that's what I'm hoping for.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: I'm curious when I hear you talk about that. There, obviously, is the political dealings between China and the US. And then there are the business dealings. How separate are the two? How much are you influenced by if there is tension between the two? Are you still able to get deals done, for example, when things are at a more tense point?CHUCK ROBBINS: Yeah, the only thing that we-- the only thing that really affects how we think about it is regulation, right? So I mean, there's always going to be noise. And I think we've all-- most of the CEOs here have grown into their executive career and their CEO positions in times of crisis. And there's always something going on. And we're just kind of used to it. And so there's always going to be noise. But you just deal with things once they become reality. Now you can plan for most likely outcomes, which we will do, but none of the rhetoric has really affected how we think about doing business around the world right now.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you have to get leaner, Chuck, on expenses and employees, given what you are seeing in the economy and what everybody's talking about here?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, we're actually going to exit this year, spending more in expenses than we did coming in. If you go back to the beginning of the pandemic, we've been very thoughtful about how we've added expenses through the whole pandemic over the last few years. So we're in a reasonably good position. We are investing heavily in cybersecurity right now. So we are reducing our costs in other areas. But we're pumping it into cyber and a few other areas because, obviously, cyber is one-- that's another one of the big discussions here this week.JULIE HYMAN: Does it feel to you like most of the cuts in big tech have happened, that we're now moving to a different phase of that cycle, or do you think there are more to come?CHUCK ROBBINS: It's hard for me to say. I mean, there was some news out today about Microsoft. So I think that-- I haven't seen anything official from them yet, but I think it's pretty difficult to say. I think the next couple of quarters are really going to tell us what's really going to happen in the economy. And I think that will determine the answer to your question.BRIAN SOZZI: Cisco is an acquisition machine, and there's been some talk about eyeing your next big potential deal. Is anything imminent, and where would you possibly be looking?CHUCK ROBBINS: Who's talking about that?BRIAN SOZZI: I hear things, Chuck. I hear things.CHUCK ROBBINS: [LAUGHS] Look, we-- the M&amp;A world has been pretty quiet for about a year, as evidenced by some of the investment banking numbers that we've heard from the banks. I think the-- look, a lot of the possible targets for us in M&amp;A had very high valuations. And we all know that those valuations came down pretty significantly 12, 14 months ago, it began. And I'm hopeful that now that some of those great companies out there with incredible technology, I think a lot of them are coming to grips with the fact that these may be more real valuations than they had hoped.And as they look ahead to the next 12 months, I think it also could indicate they look ahead, they don't see necessarily a definitive bright light ahead. So maybe they'll be more open to reasonable conversations, but we'll have to see.JULIE HYMAN: Are there particular places-- places in the business where you want to add on?CHUCK ROBBINS: Yes.JULIE HYMAN: Do you want to tell us what they are?[LAUGHTER]CHUCK ROBBINS: Look, we talk about cybersecurity. We're doing a lot of organic work. There's always opportunities for inorganic there. There's an emerging area called full stack observability in this world of new application architectures. There's a lot of opportunity there, where we have incredible organic capabilities, as well as possibility for inorganic. There's IoT. There's all sorts of options out there.JULIE HYMAN: We were at a party that you held the other night. And you were talking about--CHUCK ROBBINS: I held a party?JULIE HYMAN: You-- the company held a party, anyway. So I'll say it's you. And I got a sense of you as the not-- like, as a human, not just as a CEO. But what you were talking about, some of your philanthropic work, et cetera, also illustrates the-- what Davos sort of straddles, right? The business side of things, the geopolitical side of things, and then the philanthropic side of things and trying to make the world a better place. Like, how do you think about that duality and how you spend your time and what you want to be spending your time on?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, I think it's important that wherever we operate, that our communities are healthy. And so we've embarked on this years ago. We were doing a lot of this stuff before, the whole notion of stakeholder capitalism. But I do think we live in a world today where our employees want to know us as humans. Our employees really care about culture. They care about your purpose.In fact, if you look at some of the latest surveys, I mean, employees will tell you that salary is not number one anymore. It's important. It has to be reasonable, and it has to be great, but the culture and what you stand for as an organization really matters. You had the Edelman Trust come out again that actually said the CEOs and the business community are more trusted than government leaders again, so that we have-- our employees are asking us to be responsible.And so it's an interesting set of dynamics that we have to navigate that when I took the job, I wasn't aware we were going to have to navigate all of them. But I think the philanthropic side and giving back to our communities is just, we need healthy communities. We need housing, affordable housing. We need firefighters who can afford to live and raise their families. We need teachers to be able to afford and live in the areas. And that's why we got involved in housing and homelessness in San Jose. And I just think it's an important part of what companies need to do.[MUSIC PLAYING]JULIE HYMAN: You know, and that last answer is so interesting to me because, again, it kind of encapsulates Davos, right? There is all this criticism. All these guys are controlling the world. The CEOs think that they're trying to do good. And whether they're trying to do good because it looks good or because it creates a culture that is attractive to workers, if the effect is that they're helping homelessness in San Jose or whatever it is, does it matter? I don't know. It's sort of a philosophical question, I guess.BRIAN SOZZI: No, I'm glad you asked it, Julie, because we've been trying to humanize a lot of these executives here at Yahoo Finance this week. And we've had some really interesting conversations. And I'll also just add on what Chuck said about acquisitions. This is a different vibe in the Congress Center. Usually, the Congress Center is when a lot of the executives, they float around. They get their coffee. They get their danish, get some other various snacks.We didn't really see a lot of executives in there. And I'm told-- and you've been hearing it as well-- a lot of these executives, this is the first time they were able to get face time with key leaders in their own industry and around the world, a lot of more meetings this time around. I do think the top five deals this year will, in some form, trace back to this World Economic Forum.JULIE HYMAN: Oh, interesting theory.BRIAN SOZZI: That's my big call.JULIE HYMAN: We're going to hold you to that as we do--BRIAN SOZZI: Please do.JULIE HYMAN: --to everything you say, Brian Sozzi.BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you.]"
