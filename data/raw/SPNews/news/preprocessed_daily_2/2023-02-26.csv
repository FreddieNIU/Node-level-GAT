After the stock price dropped 3.5% last week, the company's market value declined by US$5.6b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Texas InstrumentsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior Vice President of Analog Signal Chain, Hagop Kozanian, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$170 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$169. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Texas Instruments insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Texas Instruments Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Texas Instruments. Specifically, insiders ditched US$386k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Texas Instruments Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Texas Instruments insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$188m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Texas Instruments Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Texas Instruments shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Texas Instruments makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Texas Instruments. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Texas Instruments (including 1 which is a bit concerning).But note: Texas Instruments may not be the best stock to buy.

Tech firms generally reinvest their profits back into the business and seek growth rather than returning capital to shareholders through dividends. That said, many tech companies pay dividends. These dividends attract investors who like the steady income dividends represent.Investing in dividend-paying tech stocks provides the benefits of regular income and potential capital appreciation. Tech stocks have been one of the fastest-growing sectors over the past few decades. Although the past year has been tough on the sector, most investors expect it to rebound long term. The dividends these shares include provide income while the sector normalizes.TickerCompanyPriceIBMIBM$131.71CSCOCisco$49.69TXNTexas Instruments$170.76MSFTMicrosoft$252.67AAPLApple$148.48ORCLOracle$86.20QCOMQualcomm$123.70InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock represents a technology company often cited for its dividend. The company offers a range of hardware, software, and services. IBM is particularly well-known as a leader in enterprise computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The company boasts a diverse customer base that includes governments, businesses, and individuals and operates globally.IBM might be a controversial pick to lead this list, as the stock has shown weak returns over the past decade. In fact, $1,000 invested in its shares would only have grown to $1,024 today(1). But that return does not include IBM’s dividend, which has not been reduced since 1994. That dividend currently yields 4.9%, which is an impressive rate across all stocks, particularly so within the tech sector.IBM has real growth prospects moving forward. The company is a leader in artificial intelligence (AI). There’s every chance that the company’s recent performance could change due to AI.Story continuesCisco (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock is another well-known tech name with a substantial dividend. The company provides networking hardware, software, and services. Cisco sells products and services, including routers, switches, security systems, and cloud services. Cisco’s shares have appreciated in 2023 after falling from $55 to $47 throughout 2022.Cisco shares currently trade near $50, with analyst consensus suggesting they should appreciate roughly 10% over the next 12-18 months based on the target price. Cisco recently delivered strong results with 7% sales growth topping expectations. In turn, management increased guidance for the full year. The positive news is a bright spot within tech, as many firms are bracing for negative earnings news.Cisco’s revenues increased 7% to $13.59 billion in the quarter, and the company expects current fiscal-year growth to be between 9% and 10.5% year-over-year. Those results and expectations prove that tech growth is far from over. Cisco’s dividend has not been reduced since 2011 and recent strong results indicate that will continue to be the case.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a semiconductor design and manufacturing company serving multiple industries. Its products include digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and power management solutions, among others. The company’s latest dividend equaled $1.24, yielding 2.82% for its holders.Texas Instruments reported earnings in late January with earnings per share of $2.13. That EPS was well above the $1.98 consensus Wall Street was expecting. So, from that perspective, Texas Instruments did well. Despite beating expectations, revenues still decreased by 3% on a year-over-year basis and fell 11% sequentially.There were several bright spots in the report aside from the higher-than-anticipated EPS. Texas Instruments reported $5.9 billion in free cash flow for the year on $20.03 billion in sales. It also returned $7.9 billion to shareholders, showing its commitment to income investors. Further, automotive demand increased, a potential point of strength moving forward.Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft and Activision Blizzard logo on smartphone screen close-upSource: FellowNeko / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is one of the most well-known tech shares. The company has also been paying dividends to its shareholders for nearly two decades. The company has a strong balance sheet and consistent cash flows, which allows it to offer a reliable and growing dividend. The company has a track record of increasing its dividend payout and has done so every quarter since its inception in 2003.In 2022, Microsoft paid its shareholders $2.54 in dividends per share. While that equates to a relatively low yield of 1%, it’s exceptionally sustainable, judging from the dividend’s 0.28 payout ratio. That stable dividend has grown at a rate of 9.7% over the past five years, which is another positive sign overall.Sales at Microsoft grew by a relatively low 2% in the most recent quarter. Increasing costs and decreasing operating income led to a net income of $16.4 billion during the period, down 12%. But rapid cloud revenue growth and a resurgent LinkedIn were strong points for the firm. A rebound seems highly likely for MSFT, and growth is a near certainty for one of the strongest firms in the world.Apple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.Source: Moab Republic / ShutterstockApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has grown at an astronomical 26.75% annually over the past decade. Growth at such a prolific rate is usually a consequence of reinvesting everything back into the company. Thus, investors might not expect that Apple has been steadily rewarding investors with a dividend during that period. However, it has.The company reinstituted its dividend in 2012 and hasn’t reduced it since. It is also worth noting that Apple paid a dividend from 1987 until 1995 worth 1/10th of a cent. That dividend is now 23 cents per share and has grown by 8.2% over the past five years.Like Microsoft, investing in Apple is a bet that flagging tech giants will rebound and reward current investors handsomely. Apple’s Q1 revenues fell 5%, which has signaled that demand may be shrinking as consumers buckle down in the currently volatile economy. As consumers appear less likely to shell out large sums for iPhones, the company is leaning on services where revenues hit an all-time high of $20.8 billion.Oracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.comOracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock represents a multinational technology company that provides database and enterprise software products and services along with cloud services. The company is known for its range of software solutions for business, supply chain, and human resources management. Oracle is also investing heavily in cloud services, focusing on helping customers and enterprises move their workloads to the cloud.In regards to dividends, Oracle has paid a dividend that has gone unreduced since its inception in 2009. It currently yields 1.46% and has grown 14% over the past five years.Wall Street expects mid-term growth from Oracle and has assigned its a consensus $95 stock price target. ORLC shares currently trade for $87.Oracle’s revenues increased by 18% in 2022, suggesting that long-term growth shouldn’t be a problem. Net income did decrease, however, falling by 12% during the period. Oracle is also a significant force in the cloud and is spending heavily to lure customers away from bigger tech companies in the space.Qualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquartersSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Qualcomm is another semiconductor stock that includes a dividend. The company has benefited from the growth of smartphones and 5G technology. It is a noted supplier of Apple, so as Apple shifts toward in-house chip production, investors have grown skeptical of Qualcomm’s prospects.The company’s most recent earnings do little to assuage those concerns, with revenues that declined by 12% to $9.46 billion. However, those results were in line with management’s expectations.However, there is reason to believe in Qualcomm moving forward. Apple is unlikely to move away from Qualcomm as a supplier until late 2024 at the earliest. Apple’s efforts to develop in-house chip production have not gone to plan, as the company was hoping to bring production in-house this year. That leaves the door open for Qualcomm while it continues to grow in other areas. In particular, IoT and automotive, where revenues increased by 7% and 58% YoY in the latest quarter.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Financial stocks are wavering as chances of recession mount amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will have to continue being aggressive to tame inflation. Earnings from major banks also showed that the rising interest rate environment is taking a toll on banks’ earnings. Major banks are also allocating huge sums of money for loan-loss provisions in anticipation of a recession.According to a Bloomberg report, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson believes the S&amp;P 500 could fall 26% in the first half of 2023. The analyst said that the rally during the start of the year made US equities expensive. The analyst reportedly said that the US stocks’ measure of equity risk premium has entered the “death zone.” Wilson thinks that while the US economy might dodge a full-blown recession, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policy is far from being over. He also said that the risk-reward for equities is now “very poor.”“Continued Volatility Through Year-End”A strong jobs report and data pointing to stubborn inflation has forced investors to keep their optimism in check. Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, said that investors are still trying to adjust to the reality that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to change its hawkish stance and instead will focus on fighting inflation, according to Bloomberg. That, according to Schleif, means we will experience “continued volatility through year-end.”Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Ferran Fusalba Roselló on UnsplashMethodologyFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify stocks from the Financial sector with PE ratios under 15 as of February 22.

It also varies from time to time in terms of what the economy is in the economic cycle.In terms of the present day, it's uncertain where the economy is in the economic cycle.Unemployment in the United States is low and the economy is growing. Yet the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially last year and it is expected to raise rates further this year.On Friday, the Commerce Department showed that the personal consumption expenditures price index increased 5.4% last month from the same month in the prior year, an actual rise from the 5.3% annual pace in December of 2022.Meanwhile, the underlying 'core' inflation also rose 4.7% from a year earlier, versus December 2022's 4.6% pace.Story continuesAs a result, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said, ""It's going to take more effort on the part of the Fed to get inflation on that sustainable downward path to 2%.""If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, the economy could slow or even enter into a recession. If that's the case, the average earnings growth could slow or even go negative.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds. Investors are regaining confidence in the stock market as the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 4.92% year-to-date return. Moreover, global inflation is likely to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023,  as reported by International Monetary Fund in January. The report also mentioned that 84% of countries are expected to experience lower headline inflation this year as compared to 2022. Considering this positive outlook of the market, investors show an inclination toward stocks that would help them achieve stable regular income. In this regard, dividend-focused companies with strong dividend growth track records remain popular among investors.Dividend growers have historically outperformed their peers, becoming top choices for investors. According to a report by Merrill Edge, an American financial services company, dividend stocks can help to alleviate portfolio losses when stock prices fall. The report further highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — stocks that have raised their dividend for 25 years or more — delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market. In addition to this, dividend stocks reflected a volatility of 13.22%, in contrast with a 14.22% volatility for the S&amp;P 500.Analysts expect that dividend stocks will be able to maintain their performance in 2023 as well. According to UBS, dividends per share in the S&amp;P 500 will grow by 1% this year, even with a potential 11% decline in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The financial services company also estimated that dividends per share could grow by 20% in the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids a recession.Story continuesMcDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some of the most important companies that have raised their dividends for a significant period of time. Moreover, these companies have strong cash flow generation that promises further dividend growth. In view of these arguments, we will discuss the dividend aristocrats that are popular among hedge funds.S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund PopularityTechnology share chartOur Methodology:Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have increased their dividends consistently over the past 25 consecutive years. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 15 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund Popularity15. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57A California-based energy company, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) specializes in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company posted revenue of $56.4 billion, which showed a 17.3% growth from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company paid nearly $11 billion to shareholders in dividends.On January 25, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) declared a 6.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.51 per share. This marked the company's 36th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of February 24, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.77%.

(NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL).In January, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) authorized the repurchase of the company's common stock worth $75 billion. Given this, Truist raised its price target on the stock in February to $179 and maintained a Hold rating on the shares.At the end of December 2022, 57 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), down from 66 in the previous quarter. However, the value of these stakes grew to $32.2 billion this quarter, from $27.1 billion a quarter earlier.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational healthcare company that develops medical devices. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.29%, as of February 24. It maintains a 45-year streak of consistent dividend growth.Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds as 58 elite funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q4 2022, up from 55 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 in February and maintained a Hold rating on the shares, highlighting the company's solid recent quarterly earnings.Artisan Partners mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American multinational beverage corporation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is next on our list of top dividend stocks among hedge funds. It offers a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, having raised it by 4.5% on February 16. This marked the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.09%, as of February 24.In February, Citigroup initiated its coverage of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with a Buy rating and a $68 price target, appreciating the company's structural sales growth last year.As of the close of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared with 59 in the preceding quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $28.8 billion. With 400 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company, based in Illinois. In January, Barclays raised its price target on the stock to $125 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's medical device growth.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds, currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a renewable energy company, based in Florida, US. On February 17, the company declared a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.4675 per share. This increase took the company's dividend growth streak to 27 years.

(NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a New York-based multinational consumer products company.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) specializes in the production of painting and coating material.

Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Lowe's Companies, Inc.

It maintains a 50-year streak of consistent dividend growth.In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some other popular dividend stocks favored by investors.As of the close of Q4 2022, 70 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), worth over $4.4 billion collectively.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:15 Best Oil Stocks to Buy10 Small Cap SaaS Stocks Hedge Funds are Piling Into13 Most Profitable Food StocksDisclosure.

The allotments were originally approved during the COVID-19 pandemic and boosted the typical SNAP payment by $95 a month.Thirty-two states stopped paying emergency allotments after Feb. 28, joining the 18 other states that ended the extra payments earlier. It’s a particularly tough time for SNAP recipients to have their benefits cut, as food prices remain high even amid a recent slowdown in the overall inflation rate.With more of their budgets going toward essentials, many SNAP customers are expected to slow their spending in other areas. This does not bode well for Dollar General and other discount retailers.As Business Insider reported, most of Dollar General’s stores are located in rural communities where customers are “increasingly economically strained,” President and CFO John Garratt said during a call with investors last week.“It’s possible that this could further pressure the low-income customer somewhat in the near-term,” Garratt added. “We didn’t see an impact last year. Some rolled off. But the customer is in a different place now.” Other discount retailers bracing for a slowdown include off-price department chain Burlington and value chain Big Lots.“We remain concerned about the lower-income customer, our core customer,” Burlington CEO Michael O’Sullivan said during a call with investors earlier this month. “In 2022, this customer group bore the brunt of the impact of inflation on real household incomes. We think the impact of inflation will moderate this year, but there are other factors that could hurt this customer, such as a rise in unemployment and the ending of expanded SNAP benefits.” Story continuesSimilarly, Big Lots customers are “pinched,” CEO Bruce Thorn said during a recent investor call. “At this point, 30% of that lower household income customer, their expenses today are greater than their income coming in. And 70% of them have curbed spending as a result of that.”Because SNAP provides food-purchasing assistance to low-income U.S. households, many beneficiaries shop at discount stores to make their money stretch further. Food stamps account for more than 10% of overall dollar-store revenues and can contribute more than one-fifth of overall supermarket sales in lower-income areas, Fox Business reported, citing comments from Howard Jackson, president of the retail advisory firm HSA Consulting.As GOBankingRates previously reported, research conducted by IRI found that before the pandemic, SNAP recipients accounted for roughly 12% of all food and beverage sales online and in stores at major chains. During the first year of the pandemic, SNAP shoppers drove 19% of dollar growth for food and beverage retailers — mainly because of the emergency allotments.With SNAP recipients losing the extra money they got during the pandemic, grocery sales at many retailers are likely to take a hit. In fact, this has already happened. During the fiscal quarter ended in August 2022, supermarkets in eight states that already ended emergency allotments underperformed those in the 38 states that still paid the allotments, according to a report from BMO Capital Markets.Once you factor in 2023 cost-of-living increases for SNAP benefits, Goldman Sachs analysts expect overall SNAP benefits to decline 7% this year compared with last year. That will end at least three consecutive years of growth, Fox Business noted.Of the companies that Goldman Sachs analyzed, bargain retailer Grocery Outlet had the highest exposure to SNAP, at about 15% of total sales in 2021. Others with high exposure include Walmart, Dollar General, Family Dollar, Kroger and BJ’s Wholesale Club. Each of those chains got nearly 10% of revenue from food stamps.Some of the lost SNAP revenue will be recovered through sales to higher-income consumers who have gravitated to discount stores to offset high inflation. Another positive trend is the low unemployment rate, which should make it easier for low-income individuals to find work and boost their earnings.Take Our Poll: What Do You Plan To Use Your Tax Refund For?Dollar Tree: 5 High-Quality Items To Buy NowEven so, some retail experts expect discount chains to suffer from lower SNAP-related sales because they operate with such thin margins.“It is difficult in this very low margin business to develop capital and sustain a business without outside support,” Stephanie Johnson, vice president of government relations for the National Grocers Association (NGA), said in a letter to Congress.More From GOBankingRatesThe 15 Biggest Bank Failures in US HistoryFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterMaximize your savings with these 3 expert tipsTake Our Poll: How Do You File Your Taxes?This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Food Stamps: SNAP Cuts and Low Tax Returns Spell Disaster for Dollar General and Other Discount Retailers]"

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on Occidental Petroleum's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:45% = US$13b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.45 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 45% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Occidental Petroleum has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 31% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Despite this, Occidental Petroleum's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 13% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is OXY fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Occidental Petroleum Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Occidental Petroleum's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 3.1% (implying that the company keeps97% of its income) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth and this should be reflected in its growth number, but that's not the case.In addition, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 21% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 19%) over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Occidental Petroleum certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. In addition, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that the company's earnings are expected to continue to shrink.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Sealed Air's (NYSE:SEE) look very promising so lets take a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Sealed Air, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$955m ÷ (US$6.2b - US$2.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Sealed Air has an ROCE of 23%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Packaging industry average of 11%. Check out our latest analysis for Sealed Air roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sealed Air compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Sealed Air's ROCE Trend?Sealed Air is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 38% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Sealed Air's ROCEAs discussed above, Sealed Air appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Considering the stock has delivered 22% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Sealed Air, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.Sealed Air is not the only stock earning high returns.

If you want to see more high growth high margin stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Buy.High margin stocks have higher margins than average by a fair margin.Generally, maintaining substantially higher than average margins in the long term is difficult given competition.If there is a new opportunity given a new market or a new technological development, a company that captures that opportunity might have few competitors and high margins temporarily. When more firms join and there is more competition, however, margins can decline. With more competition, the firm might have to spend more on advertising, its costs could increase, or it might have to lower the price of its products, all of which could lead to narrower margins.While higher than average margins tend to decrease over time given competition, some companies have higher margins than average either for temporary reasons or for more competitive advantage reasons.Some companies have higher margins for temporary reasons.If oil prices rise considerably, for instance, some oil companies are going to have higher margins than companies in some other industries simply because oil prices have risen a lot. The same, of course, is also true. If oil prices decline, those companies could have lower margins.Some companies have higher margins given they have competitive advantages such as strong brands. Because companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have strong brands, they can charge more for their products than companies that make comparable products can. Because they have similar costs and higher price points, companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have higher margins.There are different types of margins such as gross margins, operating margins, and profit margins. Although all are important, profit margins are arguably the most important for many investors as EPS can lead to dividends or share buybacks if a company has excess capital and management decides to return the excess capital back to shareholders.Story continuesWhat is high, average, and low margin differs based on industry, time period, and also what type of margin it is. For the stocks listed in this article, we define companies with profit margins of over 15% as having high margin. The average profit margin can vary from time to time but is generally considered around 10% give or take several percentage points. Some might think 20% is high profit margin but everyone's definition is different.High GrowthHigh growth companies have different definitions for different people. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.The expected growth rate of a company can change depending on where the economy is in the economic cycle.In terms of where the economy is in the current economic cycle, it is uncertain. Unemployment is low and GDP is growing but the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates considerably and will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, the economy could slow considerably or even enter into a recession. If the economy slows too much, the broader market could go lower and earnings growth might underperform.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Real Estate, BuildingPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 11 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Buy, we selected 11 stocks with competitive advantages with profit margins higher than 15% and EPS Next 5 Year Ratio higher than 10% according to FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Since it is an estimate, the EPS Next 5 Year Ratio can change from time to time depending on economic developments, company specific developments, and analyst views.Given economic and corporate developments, profit margins will also change, sometimes substantially from quarter to quarter given many factors, including potentially one time factors, affect net income.

It also varies from time to time in terms of what the economy is in the economic cycle.In terms of the present day, it's uncertain where the economy is in the economic cycle.Unemployment in the United States is low and the economy is growing. Yet the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially last year and it is expected to raise rates further this year.On Friday, the Commerce Department showed that the personal consumption expenditures price index increased 5.4% last month from the same month in the prior year, an actual rise from the 5.3% annual pace in December of 2022.Meanwhile, the underlying 'core' inflation also rose 4.7% from a year earlier, versus December 2022's 4.6% pace.Story continuesAs a result, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said, ""It's going to take more effort on the part of the Fed to get inflation on that sustainable downward path to 2%.""If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, the economy could slow or even enter into a recession. If that's the case, the average earnings growth could slow or even go negative.

In many ways, this investment category represents the best of both worlds. Fundamentally, passive-income providers typically align with established (and therefore profitable) businesses. Since the market can go either way under ambiguous cycles, dividend providers offer a hedge.However, pure passive-income plays don’t offer much upside return. On the other hand, growth-oriented investments generally provide significant returns during decisively bullish cycles. However, they also present risks. And that’s where the best dividend growth stocks come into play. Specifically, all these securities enjoy forecasted returns in the double digits. Just as well, they provide passive income, affording confidence in an uncertain environment. So, without further ado, below are the best dividend growth stocks to buy.PMPhilip Morris$99.59KOCoca-Cola$59.98SYYSysco$77.47BDXBecton Dickinson$240.40KIMKimco Realty$20.38FANGDiamondback Energy$137.29DVNDevon Energy$53.59Philip Morris (PM)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the big tobacco giants, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) might not be everyone’s cup of tea and I get that. However, if you’re a sector-agnostic investor merely seeking the best dividend growth stocks to buy, PM is difficult to ignore. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 5.08%. As well, it enjoys 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Financially, the company could use a little bit of work, I’m not going to lie. For instance, its balance sheet ranks on the lower side of the average, with a low cash-to-debt ratio. At the same time, its Altman Z-Score hits 3.2, reflecting a reasonably stable profile.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMost notably on the optimistic front, Philip Morris gets it done on the bottom line. Its net margin stands at 28.49%, outpacing over 89% of the competition. As well, its return on asset pings at 20%, blowing past 75.5% of its peers. Finally, covering analysts peg PM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $111.09, implying over 11% upside potential.Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA soft drink juggernaut, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) represents an icon of American-style capitalism. Typically, investors consider it a boring entity. However, it actually ranks among the best dividend growth stocks to buy. On the passive income side, Coca-Cola carries a forward yield of 3.08%. That’s conspicuously above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. It’s also a Dividend Aristocrat,  featuring 62 years of consecutive dividend increases.Financially, Coca-Cola’s strengths center on its operations. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 4.6%, beating out over 62% of its peers. As well, its book growth rate during the same period pings at 7.9%, above nearly 68% of the competition. Most notably, its net margin comes in at 22.19%, ranking above 93% of the industry.Again, despite its boring reputation, Wall Street sees much upside potential in KO stock. Presently, covering analysts peg shares as a consensus strong buy. Also, their price target of $68.36 implies a return of over 14%. Thus, KO is one of the best dividend growth stocks to buy.Sysco (SYY)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA multinational corporation, Sysco (NYSE:SYY) markets and distributes food products, small wares, kitchen equipment, and tabletop items to various industries. These include restaurants, healthcare, and educational facilities, and hospitality businesses like hotels and inns. While boring, SYY actually offers a healthy mixture of growth and passive income. For the latter, Sysco carries a forward yield of 2.55%, also above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Further, its payout ratio comes in at 42.63%, representing a sustainable yield. Moreover, Sysco is another Dividend Aristocrat, featuring 54 years of consecutive dividend increases.Operationally, Sysco’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 5.2%, beating out over 57% of its peers. Further, its return on asset pings at 6.45%, outpacing almost 77% of the industry. Although it does not carry the most exciting reputation, Sysco enjoys solid support on Wall Street. Covering analysts peg SYY as a consensus moderate buy. Further, they target a price of $88.15, implying nearly 15% upside potential. Thus, it’s another example of the best dividend growth stocks that investors shouldn’t ignore.Becton Dickinson (BDX)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA medical technology company, Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents. For those seeking stability in their best dividend growth stocks, BDX may be what the doctor ordered. Currently, its forward yield sits at 1.52%, which is modest. However, its payout ratio is 26.77%, signifying much confidence in yield sustainability. Also, it’s a Dividend Aristocrat. Becton commands 51 years of consecutive dividend increases.Even better, the market prices BDX at a forward multiple of 19.83. As a discount to earnings, Becton ranks better than 66.67% of the competition. Also, it offers solid profit margins. For instance, its net margin stands at 8.48%, outpacing 66% of its peers. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg BDX as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target pings at $278.63, implying over 16% upside potential.Kimco Realty (KIM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA real estate investment trust (REIT), Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) is North America’s largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, including mixed-use assets, per its website. Notably, its exceptional relevance also makes KIM one of the best dividend growth stocks to buy.For passive income, Kimco offers a forward yield of 4.5%. That’s just a hair above the real estate sector’s average yield of 4.46%. However, prospective investors should note that its payout ratio presently stands at 125.71%. Fiscally, Kimco could use a little extra work. For instance, while it features a net margin of 7.29%, it’s one of the worst-ranking REITs available. As well, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic dropped Kimco’s Altman Z-Score to 1.23, technically signifying distress. However, moving forward, prospective investors should note its three-year book growth rate of 8.2%. This stat beats out almost 80% of the competition.Lastly, Kimco brings significant heat in the forecasted capital appreciation segment. Covering analysts peg KIM as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $24.03, implying over 17% upside potential.Diamondback Energy (FANG)dividend stocks ceSource: ShutterstockWith all the current and potential rumblings in the energy sector, investors should consider Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) as one of the best dividend growth stocks to buy. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 2.24%. True, this ranks lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, its payout ratio sits at a mere 13.14%. Therefore, it’s easily sustainable.Fiscally, Diamondback may offer a compelling bargain. The market prices FANG at a trailing multiple of 5.47. As a discount to earnings, Diamondback ranks better than 63.7% of the competition. Also, FANG trades at a forward multiple of 5.49.

In many ways, this investment category represents the best of both worlds. Fundamentally, passive-income providers typically align with established (and therefore profitable) businesses. Since the market can go either way under ambiguous cycles, dividend providers offer a hedge.However, pure passive-income plays don’t offer much upside return. On the other hand, growth-oriented investments generally provide significant returns during decisively bullish cycles. However, they also present risks. And that’s where the best dividend growth stocks come into play. Specifically, all these securities enjoy forecasted returns in the double digits. Just as well, they provide passive income, affording confidence in an uncertain environment. So, without further ado, below are the best dividend growth stocks to buy.PMPhilip Morris$99.59KOCoca-Cola$59.98SYYSysco$77.47BDXBecton Dickinson$240.40KIMKimco Realty$20.38FANGDiamondback Energy$137.29DVNDevon Energy$53.59Philip Morris (PM)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the big tobacco giants, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) might not be everyone’s cup of tea and I get that. However, if you’re a sector-agnostic investor merely seeking the best dividend growth stocks to buy, PM is difficult to ignore. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 5.08%. As well, it enjoys 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Financially, the company could use a little bit of work, I’m not going to lie. For instance, its balance sheet ranks on the lower side of the average, with a low cash-to-debt ratio. At the same time, its Altman Z-Score hits 3.2, reflecting a reasonably stable profile.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMost notably on the optimistic front, Philip Morris gets it done on the bottom line. Its net margin stands at 28.49%, outpacing over 89% of the competition. As well, its return on asset pings at 20%, blowing past 75.5% of its peers. Finally, covering analysts peg PM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $111.09, implying over 11% upside potential.Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA soft drink juggernaut, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) represents an icon of American-style capitalism. Typically, investors consider it a boring entity. However, it actually ranks among the best dividend growth stocks to buy. On the passive income side, Coca-Cola carries a forward yield of 3.08%. That’s conspicuously above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. It’s also a Dividend Aristocrat,  featuring 62 years of consecutive dividend increases.Financially, Coca-Cola’s strengths center on its operations. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 4.6%, beating out over 62% of its peers. As well, its book growth rate during the same period pings at 7.9%, above nearly 68% of the competition. Most notably, its net margin comes in at 22.19%, ranking above 93% of the industry.Again, despite its boring reputation, Wall Street sees much upside potential in KO stock. Presently, covering analysts peg shares as a consensus strong buy. Also, their price target of $68.36 implies a return of over 14%. Thus, KO is one of the best dividend growth stocks to buy.Sysco (SYY)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA multinational corporation, Sysco (NYSE:SYY) markets and distributes food products, small wares, kitchen equipment, and tabletop items to various industries. These include restaurants, healthcare, and educational facilities, and hospitality businesses like hotels and inns. While boring, SYY actually offers a healthy mixture of growth and passive income. For the latter, Sysco carries a forward yield of 2.55%, also above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Further, its payout ratio comes in at 42.63%, representing a sustainable yield. Moreover, Sysco is another Dividend Aristocrat, featuring 54 years of consecutive dividend increases.Operationally, Sysco’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 5.2%, beating out over 57% of its peers. Further, its return on asset pings at 6.45%, outpacing almost 77% of the industry. Although it does not carry the most exciting reputation, Sysco enjoys solid support on Wall Street. Covering analysts peg SYY as a consensus moderate buy. Further, they target a price of $88.15, implying nearly 15% upside potential. Thus, it’s another example of the best dividend growth stocks that investors shouldn’t ignore.Becton Dickinson (BDX)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA medical technology company, Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents. For those seeking stability in their best dividend growth stocks, BDX may be what the doctor ordered. Currently, its forward yield sits at 1.52%, which is modest. However, its payout ratio is 26.77%, signifying much confidence in yield sustainability. Also, it’s a Dividend Aristocrat. Becton commands 51 years of consecutive dividend increases.Even better, the market prices BDX at a forward multiple of 19.83. As a discount to earnings, Becton ranks better than 66.67% of the competition. Also, it offers solid profit margins. For instance, its net margin stands at 8.48%, outpacing 66% of its peers. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg BDX as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target pings at $278.63, implying over 16% upside potential.Kimco Realty (KIM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA real estate investment trust (REIT), Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) is North America’s largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, including mixed-use assets, per its website. Notably, its exceptional relevance also makes KIM one of the best dividend growth stocks to buy.For passive income, Kimco offers a forward yield of 4.5%. That’s just a hair above the real estate sector’s average yield of 4.46%. However, prospective investors should note that its payout ratio presently stands at 125.71%. Fiscally, Kimco could use a little extra work. For instance, while it features a net margin of 7.29%, it’s one of the worst-ranking REITs available. As well, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic dropped Kimco’s Altman Z-Score to 1.23, technically signifying distress. However, moving forward, prospective investors should note its three-year book growth rate of 8.2%. This stat beats out almost 80% of the competition.Lastly, Kimco brings significant heat in the forecasted capital appreciation segment. Covering analysts peg KIM as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $24.03, implying over 17% upside potential.Diamondback Energy (FANG)dividend stocks ceSource: ShutterstockWith all the current and potential rumblings in the energy sector, investors should consider Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) as one of the best dividend growth stocks to buy. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 2.24%. True, this ranks lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, its payout ratio sits at a mere 13.14%. Therefore, it’s easily sustainable.Fiscally, Diamondback may offer a compelling bargain. The market prices FANG at a trailing multiple of 5.47. As a discount to earnings, Diamondback ranks better than 63.7% of the competition. Also, FANG trades at a forward multiple of 5.49. Here, the energy firm outpaces nearly 65% of its rivals.As well, Diamondback delivers operationally. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 22.7%, above nearly 86% of the industry. Also, its net margin pings at 45.47%, above over 90% of sector peers. Heading to the Street, covering analysts peg FANG as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $177.77, implying over 32% upside potential.Devon Energy (DVN)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) specializes in hydrocarbon exploration. Because of the underlying relevancies, Devon ranks among the best dividend growth stocks to buy. For passive income, Devon carries a forward yield of 6.63%. That’s noticeably above the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. And while its payout ratio of 48.77% is relatively elevated, it’s still quite manageable.As with Diamondback above, Devon also offers prospective investors a possible bargain. Currently, the market prices DVN at a trailing multiple of 5.89. As a discount to earnings, Devon ranks better than 61.9% of the competition. In addition, DVN trades at a forward multiple of 6.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds. Investors are regaining confidence in the stock market as the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 4.92% year-to-date return. Moreover, global inflation is likely to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023,  as reported by International Monetary Fund in January. The report also mentioned that 84% of countries are expected to experience lower headline inflation this year as compared to 2022. Considering this positive outlook of the market, investors show an inclination toward stocks that would help them achieve stable regular income. In this regard, dividend-focused companies with strong dividend growth track records remain popular among investors.Dividend growers have historically outperformed their peers, becoming top choices for investors. According to a report by Merrill Edge, an American financial services company, dividend stocks can help to alleviate portfolio losses when stock prices fall. The report further highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — stocks that have raised their dividend for 25 years or more — delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market. In addition to this, dividend stocks reflected a volatility of 13.22%, in contrast with a 14.22% volatility for the S&amp;P 500.Analysts expect that dividend stocks will be able to maintain their performance in 2023 as well. According to UBS, dividends per share in the S&amp;P 500 will grow by 1% this year, even with a potential 11% decline in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The financial services company also estimated that dividends per share could grow by 20% in the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids a recession.Story continuesMcDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some of the most important companies that have raised their dividends for a significant period of time. Moreover, these companies have strong cash flow generation that promises further dividend growth. In view of these arguments, we will discuss the dividend aristocrats that are popular among hedge funds.S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund PopularityTechnology share chartOur Methodology:Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have increased their dividends consistently over the past 25 consecutive years. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 15 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund Popularity15. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57A California-based energy company, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) specializes in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company posted revenue of $56.4 billion, which showed a 17.3% growth from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company paid nearly $11 billion to shareholders in dividends.On January 25, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) declared a 6.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.51 per share. This marked the company's 36th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of February 24, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.77%. Other popular dividend stocks among investors include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL).In January, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) authorized the repurchase of the company's common stock worth $75 billion. Given this, Truist raised its price target on the stock in February to $179 and maintained a Hold rating on the shares.At the end of December 2022, 57 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), down from 66 in the previous quarter. However, the value of these stakes grew to $32.2 billion this quarter, from $27.1 billion a quarter earlier.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational healthcare company that develops medical devices. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.29%, as of February 24. It maintains a 45-year streak of consistent dividend growth.Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds as 58 elite funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q4 2022, up from 55 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 in February and maintained a Hold rating on the shares, highlighting the company's solid recent quarterly earnings.Artisan Partners mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American multinational beverage corporation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is next on our list of top dividend stocks among hedge funds. It offers a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, having raised it by 4.5% on February 16. This marked the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.09%, as of February 24.In February, Citigroup initiated its coverage of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with a Buy rating and a $68 price target, appreciating the company's structural sales growth last year.As of the close of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared with 59 in the preceding quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $28.8 billion. With 400 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company, based in Illinois. In January, Barclays raised its price target on the stock to $125 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's medical device growth.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds, currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a renewable energy company, based in Florida, US. On February 17, the company declared a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.4675 per share. This increase took the company's dividend growth streak to 27 years.

(NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a New York-based multinational consumer products company. It is one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds, with 61 hedge fund positions in Q4 2022, up from 57 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey's data.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) specializes in the production of painting and coating material.

Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Lowe's Companies, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP), worth over $4.4 billion collectively.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:15 Best Oil Stocks to Buy10 Small Cap SaaS Stocks Hedge Funds are Piling Into13 Most Profitable Food StocksDisclosure.

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for TransDigm Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TransDigm GroupIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Raymond Laubenthal, sold US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$670 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$742). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 2.4% of Raymond Laubenthal's holding. Raymond Laubenthal was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. TransDigm Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, currently worth about US$197m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At TransDigm Group Tell Us?The fact that there have been no TransDigm Group insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for PPG Industries How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PPG Industries is:16% = US$1.1b ÷ US$6.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.Does PPG Industries Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see PPG Industries has a similar ROE to the average in the Chemicals industry classification (18%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. To know the 3 risks we have identified for PPG Industries visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining PPG Industries' Debt And Its 16% Return On EquityPPG Industries does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.02. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Hologic's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Hologic How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hologic is:19% = US$990m ÷ US$5.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Hologic's Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo start with, Hologic's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Hologic's exceptional 45% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesWe then compared Hologic's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 16% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is HOLX worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether HOLX is currently mispriced by the market.Is Hologic Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Hologic doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Hologic's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

A spokesperson said the EU's consultation was a ""positive first sign"" of a debate starting.Story continues""We argue for a framework that will facilitate a fair and equitable commercial relationship that recognizes a direct contribution by tech giants to network costs,"" they said.Regulations will, however, be difficult to implement and enforce, said Shahid Ahmed, executive vice president at NTT and an adviser to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.""We saw something very similar - the whole net neutrality debate - attempted in the U.S.,"" he said.The MWC, which begins on Monday, will also see new product launches from companies including Huawei, Xiaomi , HMD Global, Honor, and RealMe.Other hot topics include the 5G adoption rate, which has disappointed some executives, and the potential uses of generative AI systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT.""Everything on the floor of MWC is about looking to the future,"" Guisti said.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the energy sector, its previous performance, and outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Invest In. The energy sector in the US remained stable in 2022 due to high prices and tight supplies. The sector ended the year with record gains, soaring 58% as of December 30, compared with a roughly 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500. According to Dow Jones Market Data, this was the first time ever for the energy sector to emerge as a solo winner of the S&amp;P 500 calendar year. Moreover, it was the benchmark’s only sector that did not decline during the year.One of the main factors that contributed to the solid performance of the energy sector last year was the rising oil and gas prices. Analysts are expecting the trend to continue this year as well. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for OANDA in New York, talked to Fox Business about the energy industry’s outlook for 2023. He asserted that many geo-political tensions could still keep the oil and gas prices elevated this year. He further mentioned that though fluctuating market conditions could not reveal a clear picture, the energy sector is still in a good shape amid a slow global economy.The outperformance of the energy industry is driving investors toward the sector as energy companies have steadily raised their dividends over the last 12 months, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report also mentioned that these payouts would still hold an effect even if the economy enters a recession. In addition to this, investors also tend to focus on companies that have strong free cash flow generation. According to a report by Fidelity, free cash flow yields in the energy industry were at their all-time high relative to the broader market at the end of 2022. Moreover, many energy companies have significantly reduced their debts over the past two years and are now returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), NextEra Energy, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the energy sector, its previous performance, and outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Invest In. The energy sector in the US remained stable in 2022 due to high prices and tight supplies. The sector ended the year with record gains, soaring 58% as of December 30, compared with a roughly 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500. According to Dow Jones Market Data, this was the first time ever for the energy sector to emerge as a solo winner of the S&amp;P 500 calendar year. Moreover, it was the benchmark’s only sector that did not decline during the year.One of the main factors that contributed to the solid performance of the energy sector last year was the rising oil and gas prices. Analysts are expecting the trend to continue this year as well. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for OANDA in New York, talked to Fox Business about the energy industry’s outlook for 2023. He asserted that many geo-political tensions could still keep the oil and gas prices elevated this year. He further mentioned that though fluctuating market conditions could not reveal a clear picture, the energy sector is still in a good shape amid a slow global economy.The outperformance of the energy industry is driving investors toward the sector as energy companies have steadily raised their dividends over the last 12 months, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report also mentioned that these payouts would still hold an effect even if the economy enters a recession. In addition to this, investors also tend to focus on companies that have strong free cash flow generation. According to a report by Fidelity, free cash flow yields in the energy industry were at their all-time high relative to the broader market at the end of 2022. Moreover, many energy companies have significantly reduced their debts over the past two years and are now returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), NextEra Energy, Inc.

Moreover, global inflation is likely to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023,  as reported by International Monetary Fund in January.

Considering this positive outlook of the market, investors show an inclination toward stocks that would help them achieve stable regular income. In this regard, dividend-focused companies with strong dividend growth track records remain popular among investors.Dividend growers have historically outperformed their peers, becoming top choices for investors. According to a report by Merrill Edge, an American financial services company, dividend stocks can help to alleviate portfolio losses when stock prices fall. The report further highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — stocks that have raised their dividend for 25 years or more — delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market.

We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business.

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American multinational beverage corporation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is next on our list of top dividend stocks among hedge funds.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company, based in Illinois.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Lowe's Companies, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP) ranks sixth on our list of top dividend stocks among hedge funds. The company offers a per-share dividend of $1.15 every quarter and has a dividend yield of 2.63%, as of February 24. It maintains a 50-year streak of consistent dividend growth.In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some other popular dividend stocks favored by investors.As of the close of Q4 2022, 70 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), worth over $4.4 billion collectively.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:15 Best Oil Stocks to Buy10 Small Cap SaaS Stocks Hedge Funds are Piling Into13 Most Profitable Food StocksDisclosure.

These are companies whose long-term growth potential remains huge despite near-term market volatility. And now is the time for investors to load up on the shares of growth stocks before markets bottom and a new, reliable bull market takes hold.Growth stocks were largely abandoned by investors in 2022 as investors fled into the safety of cyclical and established blue-chip names. However, there’s evidence that a rotation back into growth stocks is now underway, with hedge funds and institutional investors wading back into equities that have the potential to grow and provide shareholders with strong returns. While markets continue to gyrate and a firm bottom might not be in just yet, a sea change is on the horizon. With that in mind, here are seven growth stocks to invest in now.ABNBAirbnb$125.52TSLATesla$202.07SPGIS&amp;P Global$348.13NUNu Holdings$4.89COSTCostco$493.14SUSuncor$33.40PANWPalo Alto Networks$188.74InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAirbnb (ABNB)A close-up shot of the Airbnb (ABNB) app on a smartphone screen.Source: AngieYeoh / Shutterstock.comAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) just reported its first annual profit and a blowout quarter that proves the company is in full growth mode coming out of the pandemic. For the fourth quarter of 2022, Airbnb reported earnings per share of 48 cents compared to 25 cents that was forecast, on average, on Wall Street.The firm’s Q4 revenue amounted to $1.90 billion versus analysts’ mean outlook of $1.86 billion. The San Francisco-based company’s Q4 net income soared 480% year-over-year to $319 million.The strong financial results have contributed to a 43% gain by Airbnb’s stock in 2023. However, its share price has dropped 23% over the last 12 months.Looking ahead, Airbnb sees sunnier days ahead, as it noted that its bookings jumped 20% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier.  It provided Q1 revenue guidance of $1.75 billion to $1.82 billion, above the $1.69 billion that analysts, on average, had expected.Story continuesTesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comDespite the ongoing drama and volatility that electric-vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is undergoing, it remains a growth stock. The company faces numerous challenges, including rising competition from traditional automakers, slowing demand for its vehicles in China, and cost pressures.But despite it all, Tesla continues to find ways to grow, defying the expectations of analysts and investors. The company’s latest earnings report was a mic drop that included record revenue and EPS. that was better than analysts, on average, had expected.While the owners of TSLA stock spent the fall worrying that CEO Elon Musk was overly distracted by Twitter, the electric-vehicle maker stunned everyone by reporting record fourth-quarter revenue of $24.32 billion and EPS of $1.19, which was six cents better than analysts’ mean estimate.The company has slashed its prices to help spur demand around the world and has several new vehicles on the horizon, including its much-hyped Cybertruck,. that can boost its growth further going forward,After a bruising autumn, TSLA stock has gained more than 80% so far in 2023.S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in New York City, S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) is a leading credit- rating agency and a  top publisher of financial research, including stock analysis. The company created the S&amp;P 500 index and collects a royalty anytime a mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF) replicates the index for investors to access. The company has been around since 1860, has consistently innovated over the decades, and today employs nearly 40,000 people. It has also grown to become the biggest credit rating agency in the world.While S&amp;P Global isn’t new, the company and its stock are growing steadily. S&amp;P Global got bigger in 2022 by acquiring IHS Markit, which enlarged its financial research business. Analysts who cover the company forecast, on average, that S&amp;P Global will grow its EPS by a mean annual rate of 13% in the next five years. CEO Douglas Peterson has stressed that S&amp;P Global remains firmly focused on “investments in growth and innovation.”These investments have helped to propel SPGI stock 80% higher over the last five years. The share price is up 4% this year.Nu Holdings (NU)bank stocksSource: fizkes / Shutterstock.comA more traditional growth name is Brazilian online bank Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU). The company is in rabid growth mode as it battles to gain market share across Latin America with its credit cards and loans.The efforts of the lender are starting to pay off as it just reported blockbuster earnings. In Q4, the digital bank’s gross profit rose 137% year-over-year to $578.3 million, while its revenue amounted to  $1.45 billion. For all of 2022, Nu Holdings booked record revenue of $4.8 billion. Its Q4 net income came in at $113.8 million.Perhaps most impressive to analysts was the fact that Nubank added 4.2 million customers last quarter, finishing 2022 with a total of 74.6 million customers worldwide. Its monthly average revenue per active customer increased to $8.20 in 2022, growing by 37% over the previous year. The massive growth of Nu Holdings has caught the attention of several notable investors, including Warren Buffett who has $500 million of NU stock.Nu Holdings went public in December 2021 just as markets turned south. Since its market debut, NU stock has fallen 60% . Regardless, the company’s future growth potential seems strong and worth considering.Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comRetail giant Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is essentially a bulletproof company. The warehouse club performs well in any economic environment. And although COST has been in business since 1976, it continues to grow its earnings and retail network at an impressive rate. Consider that in its fiscal first quarter that ended in November,  Costco’s net sales grew 8.1% year-over-year to $53.44 billion. Its U.S. comparable sales increased 9.3% versus the same period a year earlier.Additionally, analysts are forecasting that the company’s EPS will increase by an average annual rate of 10% for the next five years. Meanwhile, Costco has plans to open 24 new stores in 2023, including 15 new locations in the U.S.The continued growth and popularity of its membership model has made Costco the envy of the retail world and a great stock to own for the  long term. So far in 2023, COST stock has gained 8%.Suncor (SU)A sign for a Suncor Energy (SU) building.Source: Brett Holmes / Shutterstock.comIf there’s an energy company that can still cut its costs and boost its growth, it is likely Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU). The Canadian oil and gas producer just named former Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) executive Rich Kruger as its new president and CEO. Kruger’s appointment comes after Suncor was targeted last year by activist investor Elliott Management. The folks at Elliott Management have wasted no time overhauling Suncor’s management and its board of directors.Elliott Management has been pushing Suncor to boost its growth and unlock shareholder value through cost cutting and improving its balance sheet. To that end, Elliott has been pushing Suncor to sell its retail network of 1,500 Petro-Canada gas stations that’s estimated to be worth $11 billion. Helped by its internal changes and elevated oil prices, Suncor’s earnings have been on a tear in recent quarters.During the second quarter of last year, when crude oil prices were at their peak, Suncor’s net profit rose more than 400% to $3.99 billion from $868 million during the same period a year earlier. SU stock has risen 15.5% over the last 12 months.Palo Alto Networks (PANW)Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comFounded in 2005, cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is not a new company. But it is growing, taking market share, and outperforming like a start-up. The company’s latest earnings report was spectacular and pushed the stock up 10% in a single trading session. So far in 2023, PANW stock has jumped 35%. The surge came after the firm reported earnings per share of $1.05 versus analysts’ average estimate of 78 cents.Palo Alto Networks has now posted three consecutive quarters of profitability after more than a decade of red ink. The company achieved profitability ahead of schedule, has issued bullish forward guidance, and continues to use acquisitions to boost its growth.In the final months of 2022, Palo Alto Networks acquired start-up Cider Security, which focuses on software supply chain and application security. Over the last five years, the company has spent more than $3 billion on acquisitions as it seeks to boost its growth.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

Tech firms generally reinvest their profits back into the business and seek growth rather than returning capital to shareholders through dividends. That said, many tech companies pay dividends. These dividends attract investors who like the steady income dividends represent.Investing in dividend-paying tech stocks provides the benefits of regular income and potential capital appreciation. Tech stocks have been one of the fastest-growing sectors over the past few decades. Although the past year has been tough on the sector, most investors expect it to rebound long term. The dividends these shares include provide income while the sector normalizes.TickerCompanyPriceIBMIBM$131.71CSCOCisco$49.69TXNTexas Instruments$170.76MSFTMicrosoft$252.67AAPLApple$148.48ORCLOracle$86.20QCOMQualcomm$123.70InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock represents a technology company often cited for its dividend. The company offers a range of hardware, software, and services. IBM is particularly well-known as a leader in enterprise computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The company boasts a diverse customer base that includes governments, businesses, and individuals and operates globally.IBM might be a controversial pick to lead this list, as the stock has shown weak returns over the past decade. In fact, $1,000 invested in its shares would only have grown to $1,024 today(1). But that return does not include IBM’s dividend, which has not been reduced since 1994. That dividend currently yields 4.9%, which is an impressive rate across all stocks, particularly so within the tech sector.IBM has real growth prospects moving forward. The company is a leader in artificial intelligence (AI). There’s every chance that the company’s recent performance could change due to AI.Story continuesCisco (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock is another well-known tech name with a substantial dividend. The company provides networking hardware, software, and services. Cisco sells products and services, including routers, switches, security systems, and cloud services. Cisco’s shares have appreciated in 2023 after falling from $55 to $47 throughout 2022.Cisco shares currently trade near $50, with analyst consensus suggesting they should appreciate roughly 10% over the next 12-18 months based on the target price. Cisco recently delivered strong results with 7% sales growth topping expectations. In turn, management increased guidance for the full year. The positive news is a bright spot within tech, as many firms are bracing for negative earnings news.Cisco’s revenues increased 7% to $13.59 billion in the quarter, and the company expects current fiscal-year growth to be between 9% and 10.5% year-over-year. Those results and expectations prove that tech growth is far from over. Cisco’s dividend has not been reduced since 2011 and recent strong results indicate that will continue to be the case.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a semiconductor design and manufacturing company serving multiple industries. Its products include digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and power management solutions, among others. The company’s latest dividend equaled $1.24, yielding 2.82% for its holders.Texas Instruments reported earnings in late January with earnings per share of $2.13. That EPS was well above the $1.98 consensus Wall Street was expecting. So, from that perspective, Texas Instruments did well. Despite beating expectations, revenues still decreased by 3% on a year-over-year basis and fell 11% sequentially.There were several bright spots in the report aside from the higher-than-anticipated EPS. Texas Instruments reported $5.9 billion in free cash flow for the year on $20.03 billion in sales. It also returned $7.9 billion to shareholders, showing its commitment to income investors. Further, automotive demand increased, a potential point of strength moving forward.Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft and Activision Blizzard logo on smartphone screen close-upSource: FellowNeko / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is one of the most well-known tech shares. The company has also been paying dividends to its shareholders for nearly two decades. The company has a strong balance sheet and consistent cash flows, which allows it to offer a reliable and growing dividend. The company has a track record of increasing its dividend payout and has done so every quarter since its inception in 2003.In 2022, Microsoft paid its shareholders $2.54 in dividends per share. While that equates to a relatively low yield of 1%, it’s exceptionally sustainable, judging from the dividend’s 0.28 payout ratio. That stable dividend has grown at a rate of 9.7% over the past five years, which is another positive sign overall.Sales at Microsoft grew by a relatively low 2% in the most recent quarter. Increasing costs and decreasing operating income led to a net income of $16.4 billion during the period, down 12%. But rapid cloud revenue growth and a resurgent LinkedIn were strong points for the firm. A rebound seems highly likely for MSFT, and growth is a near certainty for one of the strongest firms in the world.Apple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.Source: Moab Republic / ShutterstockApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has grown at an astronomical 26.75% annually over the past decade. Growth at such a prolific rate is usually a consequence of reinvesting everything back into the company. Thus, investors might not expect that Apple has been steadily rewarding investors with a dividend during that period. However, it has.The company reinstituted its dividend in 2012 and hasn’t reduced it since. It is also worth noting that Apple paid a dividend from 1987 until 1995 worth 1/10th of a cent. That dividend is now 23 cents per share and has grown by 8.2% over the past five years.Like Microsoft, investing in Apple is a bet that flagging tech giants will rebound and reward current investors handsomely. Apple’s Q1 revenues fell 5%, which has signaled that demand may be shrinking as consumers buckle down in the currently volatile economy. As consumers appear less likely to shell out large sums for iPhones, the company is leaning on services where revenues hit an all-time high of $20.8 billion.Oracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.comOracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock represents a multinational technology company that provides database and enterprise software products and services along with cloud services. The company is known for its range of software solutions for business, supply chain, and human resources management. Oracle is also investing heavily in cloud services, focusing on helping customers and enterprises move their workloads to the cloud.In regards to dividends, Oracle has paid a dividend that has gone unreduced since its inception in 2009. It currently yields 1.46% and has grown 14% over the past five years.Wall Street expects mid-term growth from Oracle and has assigned its a consensus $95 stock price target. ORLC shares currently trade for $87.Oracle’s revenues increased by 18% in 2022, suggesting that long-term growth shouldn’t be a problem. Net income did decrease, however, falling by 12% during the period. Oracle is also a significant force in the cloud and is spending heavily to lure customers away from bigger tech companies in the space.Qualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquartersSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Qualcomm is another semiconductor stock that includes a dividend. The company has benefited from the growth of smartphones and 5G technology. It is a noted supplier of Apple, so as Apple shifts toward in-house chip production, investors have grown skeptical of Qualcomm’s prospects.The company’s most recent earnings do little to assuage those concerns, with revenues that declined by 12% to $9.46 billion. However, those results were in line with management’s expectations.However, there is reason to believe in Qualcomm moving forward. Apple is unlikely to move away from Qualcomm as a supplier until late 2024 at the earliest. Apple’s efforts to develop in-house chip production have not gone to plan, as the company was hoping to bring production in-house this year. That leaves the door open for Qualcomm while it continues to grow in other areas. In particular, IoT and automotive, where revenues increased by 7% and 58% YoY in the latest quarter.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Medtronic The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At MedtronicThe Executive VP &amp; Chief Human Resources Officer, Carol Surface, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$632k worth of shares at a price of US$105 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$83.49). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Carol Surface was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Medtronic insiders own 0.09% of the company, currently worth about US$100m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Medtronic Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Medtronic insiders selling.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds. Investors are regaining confidence in the stock market as the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 4.92% year-to-date return. Moreover, global inflation is likely to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023,  as reported by International Monetary Fund in January. The report also mentioned that 84% of countries are expected to experience lower headline inflation this year as compared to 2022. Considering this positive outlook of the market, investors show an inclination toward stocks that would help them achieve stable regular income. In this regard, dividend-focused companies with strong dividend growth track records remain popular among investors.Dividend growers have historically outperformed their peers, becoming top choices for investors. According to a report by Merrill Edge, an American financial services company, dividend stocks can help to alleviate portfolio losses when stock prices fall. The report further highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — stocks that have raised their dividend for 25 years or more — delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market. In addition to this, dividend stocks reflected a volatility of 13.22%, in contrast with a 14.22% volatility for the S&amp;P 500.Analysts expect that dividend stocks will be able to maintain their performance in 2023 as well. According to UBS, dividends per share in the S&amp;P 500 will grow by 1% this year, even with a potential 11% decline in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The financial services company also estimated that dividends per share could grow by 20% in the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids a recession.Story continuesMcDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some of the most important companies that have raised their dividends for a significant period of time. Moreover, these companies have strong cash flow generation that promises further dividend growth.

However, the value of these stakes grew to $32.2 billion this quarter, from $27.1 billion a quarter earlier.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational healthcare company that develops medical devices. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.29%, as of February 24.

The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 in February and maintained a Hold rating on the shares, highlighting the company's solid recent quarterly earnings.Artisan Partners mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American multinational beverage corporation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is next on our list of top dividend stocks among hedge funds.

The collective value of these stakes is over $28.8 billion. With 400 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company, based in Illinois.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11.

(NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Lowe's Companies, Inc.

It maintains a 50-year streak of consistent dividend growth.In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some other popular dividend stocks favored by investors.As of the close of Q4 2022, 70 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), worth over $4.4 billion collectively.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:15 Best Oil Stocks to Buy10 Small Cap SaaS Stocks Hedge Funds are Piling Into13 Most Profitable Food StocksDisclosure.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the energy sector, its previous performance, and outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Invest In. The energy sector in the US remained stable in 2022 due to high prices and tight supplies. The sector ended the year with record gains, soaring 58% as of December 30, compared with a roughly 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500. According to Dow Jones Market Data, this was the first time ever for the energy sector to emerge as a solo winner of the S&amp;P 500 calendar year. Moreover, it was the benchmark’s only sector that did not decline during the year.One of the main factors that contributed to the solid performance of the energy sector last year was the rising oil and gas prices. Analysts are expecting the trend to continue this year as well. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for OANDA in New York, talked to Fox Business about the energy industry’s outlook for 2023. He asserted that many geo-political tensions could still keep the oil and gas prices elevated this year. He further mentioned that though fluctuating market conditions could not reveal a clear picture, the energy sector is still in a good shape amid a slow global economy.The outperformance of the energy industry is driving investors toward the sector as energy companies have steadily raised their dividends over the last 12 months, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report also mentioned that these payouts would still hold an effect even if the economy enters a recession. In addition to this, investors also tend to focus on companies that have strong free cash flow generation. According to a report by Fidelity, free cash flow yields in the energy industry were at their all-time high relative to the broader market at the end of 2022.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?Duke Austin: Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta CFO, to provide a review of our financial results and full year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter and full year results, which were built off an industry-leading operational and financial platform that delivered another year of solid, safe execution and profitable growth. Additionally, total backlog of $24.1 billion at year-end was a record, and that does not include several notable recent project awards.Driven by the dedication and operational excellence of our world-class employees and the culture of collaboration throughout Quanta, we believe our '22 -- 2022 results also demonstrate the benefit of our diversified portfolio of solutions, our repeatable and sustainable model and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence and total cost solutions for our clients and ultimately, the consumer. Our portfolio of companies, diversity of service lines, geographic coverage, outstanding field leadership and deep, long-standing and collaborative relationships with our clients have allowed us to successfully navigate through the challenges presented by a global pandemic, and manage ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and supply chain constraints, while still delivering five consecutive years of record adjusted EBITDA and six consecutive years of record earnings per share.We accomplished a great deal in 2022 through the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives and our past success positions us well for the future. Our innovative approach to our infrastructure solutions, our portfolio of services and our passion for working collaboratively with our clients to support their success, positions us to be a critical partner in enabling the energy transition for years to come. Here are some of our accomplishments in 2022. We continue to successfully advance our front-end solution strategy, both organically and through acquisitions and strategic investments. Our focus is on strengthening our design, engineering, permitting, environmental, logistics and program management capabilities. This strategy allows us to expand our customers and provide them with greater certainty around cost, time to market and quality, which ultimately benefits consumers.It also enhances our risk management capabilities and increases our total addressable market. Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment revenues achieved record levels, maintain margins and increase market share despite some work delays caused by ongoing supply chain challenges. We further expanded our emergency response capabilities and supported our customers' efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by several severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize significant resources to support our customers in times of need is unmatched in our industry. LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO, which is managing Puerto Rico's more than 18,000-mile electric transmission and distribution system, continue to improve its customer service, response times, customer communication and workforce safety as well as overall system reliability.Additionally, LUMA restored power to more than 90% of its customers in less than two weeks following Hurricane Fiona, which was much faster than previous storm responses by the prior grid operator and was comparable to, if not better, than restoration times following major hurricanes in the mainland United States. Though many years of challenges and work remain, we continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta and the people of Puerto Rico and remain committed to supporting LUMA's mission to provide reliable electricity while building a modern and sustainable transmission and distribution system. We continue to grow our communication services business and increased revenues by approximately 30%. Contributing to the growth was further development of our wireless infrastructure solutions, which expand our opportunities to capitalize on 5G network deployment and ongoing enhancement of 4G wireless networks.We continue to make meaningful progress on growing our portfolio of services within each of our operating companies to further enhance our operating results. For example, we are leveraging our gas utility assets to perform certain aspects of underground electric power and telecom-related work. We believe the resource expansion and operating leverage we gained through these initiatives is significant opportunity for Quanta to reinforce our self-perform capabilities, improve operating efficiency and profitability and demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. Quanta's Capacity Model was recognized by the National Safety Council as a finalist for its prestigious Green Cross for Safety Award, which recognizes outstanding projects in organizations working to support the National Safety Council's mission to save lives and prevent injuries from workplace to any place.The Capacity Model is revolutionary because it only creates a work environment that focuses on preventing an incident but also builds the capacity to fell safely. We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and our confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continue to growth opportunities through the repurchase of approximately $128 million of our common stock and a 17% increase of our dividend while also increasing our liquidity. And finally, we continue to increase our efforts and dedicate resources towards implementing sustainable business practices throughout the organization. We made significant progress in our 2021 Sustainability Report, which discusses the company's accomplishments during that year and marks a key milestone for Quanta as we published our first consolidated sustainability metrics, including our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.We also highlighted and discussed the important positive impact Quanta has on society and enabling the energy transition and technological development. Demand is robust for our solutions that support our customers, efforts to modernize and harden the grid and prepare it for the impact of increased electric vehicle penetration. This activity drove our Electric Power segment results and backlog strength during 2022, primarily due to significant multiyear master service agreements and gains through our service line expansion with utilities. Further, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of utilities undergrounding transmission and distribution lines to protect them from the effects of severe weather events and wildfires. We see this activity increasing in the Western United States and high-fire threat areas, but these initiatives are active in other areas of the country.Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coast lines and electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation. Many of these initiatives are part of a large-scale multiyear system modernization and hardening programs. Our utility and renewable developer customers who accounted for the majority of our 2022 revenues are leaders in the effort to reduce carbon emissions, increased electrification and lead the energy transition with aggressive plans to expand and modernize the power grid and grow their renewable generation portfolios. Achieving these goals will require substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and renewable generation facilities to produce and transport clean power to ensure grid reliability due to the growth of intermittent power added to the system.For example, in December of last year, we announced Quanta's selection by Xcel Energy as its prime constructor to manage all construction activities for Colorado's Power Pathway high-voltage electric transmission project in Colorado. The approximately 610-mile high-voltage electric transmission line project is designed to increase the reliabilities of the state's power grid and enable future renewable energy development in Colorado including approximately 5,500 megawatts of new wind, solar and other resources that Xcel Energy plans to add through 2030. While the supply chain and regulatory hurdles created challenges for the renewable industry during 2022, there is significant demand for our power grid and renewable generation solutions. Number of solar projects that were delayed in 2022 are beginning to move forward in '23.Regulatory hurdles are easing and the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA which is considered by many to be the nation's most ambitious legislative action ever taken on climate is expected to have meaningful positive effect on a number of our end markets, which would be additive to our strategy for at least the next decade. Our underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment consistently performed at a high level through the year. Revenues grew strongly and margins significantly improved, after navigating through tough operating conditions caused by the global pandemic over the prior two years. Importantly, we continue to invest in our people and strategies during those challenging times and emerge as a stronger and better company, which is reflected in our solid 2022 results.Pipeline, Gas, EnergyPhoto by Quinten de Graaf on UnsplashWe expect to continue our focus on growing our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services businesses consistent with our strategy over the last five years, which are executing well and driven by regulatory spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Looking to the coming years, we continue to believe Quanta has any meaningful opportunities with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets toward greener business opportunities. Further, the IRA includes incentives to support certain energy transition technologies to further encourage a broader set of current and potential traditional energy and industrial customers to accelerate their pursuit of opportunities around these technologies.In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2023 guidance, which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our portfolio approach to this and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute our strong and strengthening competitive position in the marketplace. Further, our ongoing investment in and commitment to workforce training continues to positively impact our performance and allow us to capitalize on future opportunities. Our expectations caught for another year of meaningful growth in record revenues, improved margins and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and earnings per share. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve record levels of backlog in 2023.Jayshree will provide additional detail about our guidance in her commentary. Quanta's management team recently had the privilege of ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to commemorate our 25-year anniversary of trading on the prestigious exchange. Standing on that balcony and reflecting on what we have built over the last 25 years and where we are heading in the future was and I couldn't be prouder. Quanta's infrastructure solutions are at the tip of the spear of the energy transition in North America. At our Investor Day last year, we laid out a five-year financial goals we expect to achieve through 2026, which provided an organic growth strategy to generate a 10% adjusted earnings per share CAGR and when considering the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities, a platform with opportunity to deliver more than a 15% CAGR in adjusted earnings per share.With the strong results we delivered last year, our outlook for 2023 and the momentum we see building for the coming years, we are increasingly confident in our ability to meet or exceed those goals we laid out. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of our fourth quarter and full year results and 2023 expectations.Jayshree?Jayshree Desai: Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record fourth quarter revenues of $4.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $163 million or $1.10 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record for the fourth quarter at $1.68. Overall, the fourth quarter closed out another year of exceptional operational performance by Quanta. Our electric segment benefited from outstanding execution and higher revenues across the segment. Additionally, our underground segment performed well in the fourth quarter, led by increased volumes and operating income from our base business operations. Our renewables segment, however, was negatively impacted by unanticipated project delays, which were primarily attributable to the changes in the solar market regulations that we discussed in the third quarter.These delays created cost absorption challenges, which pressured operating margins. Additionally, the segment's operating margin was negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to impairment charges on the software implementation project at an acquired company, which commenced prior to our acquisition, but was discontinued in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, in the aggregate, against the backdrop of supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures and a complex regulatory environment, our portfolio delivered against our targets for the fourth quarter and the year, and we remain well positioned for the anticipated growth ahead. Below the line, we recorded an unrealized loss of $15 million associated with our common equity interest in fixed wireless broadband technology provider, Starry Group Holdings, which reduced the carrying value of our investment to zero.Offsetting this unrealized loss was an unrealized gain of $26 million on the sale of an investment in a non-integral unconsolidated affiliate, of which $10 million was attributable to a non-controlling ownership interest. Further commentary comparing fourth quarter '22 to fourth quarter '21 for each segment can be found in the slides accompanying this call. Our total backlog was $24.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, a significant increase from third quarter '22 and another record level. The increases across each of our segments are attributable to multiple new project awards including the previously announced Colorado Power Pathway Project and extensions and increases in expected volumes under MSAs. Our 12-month backlog was also at a record level of $13.8 billion, which we believe is another indicator of the strength of our core markets and the steady growing demand for our solutions-based approach.For the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated free cash flow of $513 million, resulting in $767 million of free cash flow for the year. Contributing to our free cash flow was the collection of $101 million of insurance proceeds following a favorable arbitration ruling associated with our Peruvian subsidiary's terminated telecommunications project. Excluding those proceeds, our fourth quarter cash flow was still in line with our expectations and included planned outflows of approximately $45 million for change of control related payments associated with the Blattner acquisition, and $54 million of previously deferred payroll taxes in accordance with the CARES Act in 2020. DSO measured 75 days for the fourth quarter of 2022, which was a reduction of 6 days compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to favorable billing arrangements related to certain projects.Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project that we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work with the customer to address the contract asset balance. Resolution of certain of these amounts could extend into 2024 and currently represent 5 to 6 days of DSO at December 31, 2022. While we remain confident in our position, our DSO will be pressured by the project in the near term. We had total liquidity of $2.4 billion at year-end and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.1 as calculated under our credit agreement. As we mentioned in today's release, we continue to identify and make strategic investments in acquisitions. In January of 2023, we acquired three businesses for total combined consideration of approximately $588 million, approximately $465 million of which was paid in cash at the time of the acquisitions.Additionally, we repurchased approximately $128 million of our common stock during the year. Turning to our full year 2023 guidance. The growth across our end markets remains robust, and we believe the tailwinds driving our growth are long in duration and create multiyear visibility in our earnings potential. As the build-out of the infrastructure necessary for the energy transition accelerates, we believe the complementary capabilities of our operations will become even more valuable to our customers. While segment designations help investors better understand the work we're performing, we'll continue to emphasize the power of our aggregate portfolio of solutions and the earnings they generate. That said, the following remarks will speak to our expectations at a segment level for 2023.As it relates to the Electric Power segment, we expect 2023 revenues ranging between $10 billion and $10.1 billion. Our base business continues to lead the growth in the segment, driven primarily by North American utilities outsourcing the activities required to replace, rebuild and modernize existing infrastructure. Notably, our 2023 expectations included $250 million of emergency restoration services revenues compared to a little over $300 million in 2022. Also included within the segment are our communications operations, which we expect will generate around $900 million of revenue, in line with 2022 levels. We expect 2023 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to range between 10.7% and 11.3%, which includes contributions of between $43 million and $48 million of earnings from our integral unconsolidated affiliates, the largest portion of which relates to the LUMA joint venture in Puerto Rico.From a seasonality perspective, we expect revenues to be lowest in the first quarter with mid-single-digit growth from first quarter '22, then growing sequentially through the third quarter, followed by a seasonal decline in the fourth. We expect fourth quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, likely around 9%, then increasing into the second and third quarters and slightly declining in the fourth quarter. The Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment full year revenues are expected to range between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion, over 15% growth compared to 2022 as we believe the headwinds faced by the solar market in '22 should meaningfully improve in the second half of 2023. We think it's important to note that within our range of guidance for renewables, approximately $3 billion of our planned revenues are already in various stages of construction, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver full year revenues at these levels.We expect 2023 operating margins for the Renewable Energy segment to be around 8.5% for the year, slightly lower than the 9% level that we would normally expect. We've invested meaningfully in the project leadership, specialized equipment and administrative needs required to support the expected ramp in project activity in the second half of '23 and into '24. However, the cost of that investment weighs on margins, particularly in the first quarter. We expect margins for the first quarter to be the lowest for the year, likely between 4% and 5%, but should strengthen in each sequential quarter as volumes increase throughout the year. From a revenue seasonality perspective, we expect segment revenues to be between $850 million and $900 million in the first quarter, the lowest for the year, then growing sequentially into the third quarter and slightly declining in the fourth.As a reminder, it's possible that as we progress through the year and gain more visibility into the nature of the work we'll be performing, there could be movements outside these initial ranges for the electric and renewable segments, depending on the type of generation or activity support. With regard to the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, we are currently anticipating full year revenue range to range between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, a slight decline compared to 2022. This decline is due to lower volumes of larger pipeline projects, which contributed almost $900 million of revenue in 2022, but are expected to be around $450 million in 2023. Despite the revenue reduction, operating margins for the year are expected to range between 7.25% and 7.75% led by our base business activities in the segment.From a seasonality perspective, we expect segment revenues in the first quarter to be in line with first quarter '22 revenues, with operating margins around 5%. We then expect revenues and margins to improve in the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. As it stands today, we expect fourth quarter '23 revenues to be the lowest for the year. These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2023 annual consolidated revenues of $18.4 billion to $18.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. This represents another record level of adjusted EBITDA with expected full year adjusted EBITDA margins at the midpoint of over 10%. With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for 2023 to be between $4.67 and $5.17 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $6.75 and $7.25.Of note, we estimate our tax rate for the year will range between 26.25% and 26.75%. The first quarter rate, however, will be negligible, potentially zero due to favorable discrete tax dynamics associated with the increase between grant date value and the vesting date value of stock-related awards under our equity compensation plan. We currently expect 2023 free cash flow to range between $750 million and $1 billion with capital expenditures of around $400 million, which should give us the ability to be within our target leverage range of 1.5x to 2x by the end of 2023. We remain committed, however, to be -- we remain committed, however, to creating shareholder value with strategic acquisitions and opportunistic repurchase activity throughout the year while retaining our investment grade rating.Going into 2023, we have approximately $345 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. As a reminder, we've provided more guidance details in the outlook summary that was posted in connection with the earnings release and can be found on our IR website at quantaservices.com. The strength and versatility of our portfolio give us confidence in our ability to continue driving results against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. The infrastructure investment required to support North America's energy transition is still in its early stages and creates opportunity for Quanta to continue providing industry-leading comprehensive end-to-end solutions. Our relationships and the breadth of our solutions have proven to be critical in our ability to navigate the economic landscape of the last three years, and we are confident those attributes position us to continue along our expected double-digit growth trajectory.This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&amp;A.

(NYSE:NKE) Pays A US$0.34 Dividend In Just Four Days",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nyse-nke-pays-122224052.html,1677414144,STORY,['NKE'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase NIKE's shares on or after the 3rd of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.34 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.36 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, NIKE stock has a trailing yield of around 1.2% on the current share price of $118.04. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether NIKE has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for NIKE If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately NIKE's payout ratio is modest, at just 35% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether NIKE generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The company paid out 108% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.NIKE paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were NIKE to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see NIKE earnings per share are up 7.3% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a steady rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. NIKE has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayHas NIKE got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? NIKE delivered reasonable earnings per share growth in recent times, and paid out less than half its profits and 108% of its cash flow over the last year, which is a mediocre outcome. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.With that being said, if dividends aren't your biggest concern with NIKE, you should know about the other risks facing this business.

60,eda29e01-4b8a-3ad0-a41b-a214cd170957,WFC,2023-02-26,One Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) insider reduced their stake by 51% in the previous year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-wells-fargo-company-nyse-130024733.html,1677416424,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in Wells Fargo &amp; Company's (NYSE:WFC ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Kleber Santos, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$46.62, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Kleber Santos.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Wells Fargo better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Wells Fargo Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Wells Fargo insiders own about US$118m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Wells Fargo shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Wells Fargo insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Wells Fargo.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(TSE:TPX.B) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 17th of March to $0.553. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.7%. Check out our latest analysis for Molson Coors Canada Molson Coors Canada's Distributions May Be Difficult To SustainWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. While Molson Coors Canada is not profitable, it is paying out less than 75% of its free cash flow, which means that there is plenty left over for reinvestment into the business. In general, cash flows are more important than the more traditional measures of profit so we feel pretty comfortable with the dividend at this level.Assuming the trend of the last few years continues, EPS will grow by 9.0% over the next 12 months. While it is good to see income moving in the right direction, it still looks like the company won't achieve profitability. However, the positive cash flow ratio gives us some comfort about the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMolson Coors Canada's Dividend Has Lacked ConsistencyEven in its relatively short history, the company has reduced the dividend at least once. Due to this, we are a little bit cautious about the dividend consistency over a full economic cycle. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $1.46 total annually to $1.46. Dividend payments have shrunk at a rate of less than 1% per annum over this time frame. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. We are encouraged to see that Molson Coors Canada has grown earnings per share at 9.0% per year over the past five years. It's not great that the company is not turning a profit, but the decent growth in recent years is certainly a positive sign. If the company can become profitable soon, continuing on this trajectory would bode well for the future of the dividend.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Molson Coors Canada will make a great income stock. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Molson Coors Canada that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

If you want to see more high growth high margin stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Buy.High margin stocks have higher margins than average by a fair margin.Generally, maintaining substantially higher than average margins in the long term is difficult given competition.If there is a new opportunity given a new market or a new technological development, a company that captures that opportunity might have few competitors and high margins temporarily. When more firms join and there is more competition, however, margins can decline. With more competition, the firm might have to spend more on advertising, its costs could increase, or it might have to lower the price of its products, all of which could lead to narrower margins.While higher than average margins tend to decrease over time given competition, some companies have higher margins than average either for temporary reasons or for more competitive advantage reasons.Some companies have higher margins for temporary reasons.If oil prices rise considerably, for instance, some oil companies are going to have higher margins than companies in some other industries simply because oil prices have risen a lot. The same, of course, is also true. If oil prices decline, those companies could have lower margins.Some companies have higher margins given they have competitive advantages such as strong brands. Because companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have strong brands, they can charge more for their products than companies that make comparable products can. Because they have similar costs and higher price points, companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have higher margins.There are different types of margins such as gross margins, operating margins, and profit margins. Although all are important, profit margins are arguably the most important for many investors as EPS can lead to dividends or share buybacks if a company has excess capital and management decides to return the excess capital back to shareholders.Story continuesWhat is high, average, and low margin differs based on industry, time period, and also what type of margin it is. For the stocks listed in this article, we define companies with profit margins of over 15% as having high margin. The average profit margin can vary from time to time but is generally considered around 10% give or take several percentage points. Some might think 20% is high profit margin but everyone's definition is different.High GrowthHigh growth companies have different definitions for different people. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.The expected growth rate of a company can change depending on where the economy is in the economic cycle.In terms of where the economy is in the current economic cycle, it is uncertain. Unemployment is low and GDP is growing but the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates considerably and will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, the economy could slow considerably or even enter into a recession. If the economy slows too much, the broader market could go lower and earnings growth might underperform.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Real Estate, BuildingPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 11 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Buy, we selected 11 stocks with competitive advantages with profit margins higher than 15% and EPS Next 5 Year Ratio higher than 10% according to FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Since it is an estimate, the EPS Next 5 Year Ratio can change from time to time depending on economic developments, company specific developments, and analyst views.Given economic and corporate developments, profit margins will also change, sometimes substantially from quarter to quarter given many factors, including potentially one time factors, affect net income.

Intuitive Surgical aims to make surgery less invasive and improve patient outcomes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlong the way, the company has developed technologies such as the da Vinci Surgical System, allowing surgeons to perform complex procedures with greater precision and control. Nowadays, Intuitive is taking steps to combine the power of big data and AI to develop incredible tools that could revolutionize the medical world. One example is real-time guidance for surgeons or enhanced training modalities.At the moment, we are just getting started with the potential of surgical robots. According to Grand View Research, in 2022, the market size of these robots was $4.4 billion, and it is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18% from 2023 to 2030. All of this makes Intuitive Surgical a very attractive stock when it comes to AI stocks.Workday (WDAY)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution.

As of this writing, the stock has increased by about 10% for the year. There are a couple of reasons for this. Thus far, investors have favored deep-value stocks like energy producers over the once-popular growth stocks. As a result, companies that prioritized “growth at any cost” have not been so well received. One example is Workday which has historically found it challenging to make a profit.The bears also question Workday’s ability to navigate a difficult business environment, given its IPO in 2012, before any prolonged recession. There is an open question about whether they can maintain their extraordinary growth rate during a recession. However, no one can deny Workday is a success when it comes to growth. For 2022, Workday saw an impressive 19.01% rise in revenue, totaling $5.139 billion. For fiscal 2023, Workday’s subscription revenue guidance is between $5.555 billion to $5.557 billion, which indicates a 22% growth compared to last year.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Financial technology concept.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Quickly Is Analog Devices Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that Analog Devices has managed to grow EPS by 27% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of Analog Devices shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 28% to 34% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Analog Devices.Story continuesAre Analog Devices Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Analog Devices has a market capitalisation of US$93b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$308m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Analog Devices but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Analog Devices To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Analog Devices has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Analog Devices   you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Q4 revenue was $6.05 billion, up 2% sequentially, while down 21% year-on-year. Full year revenue was $27 billion, flat from the prior year. Starting with data center. Revenue was $3.62 billion was down 6% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue was $15 billion and up 41%. Hyperscale customer revenue posted strong sequential growth, though short of our expectations as some cloud service providers paused at the end of the year to recalibrate their build plans. Though we generally see tightening that reflects overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe this is a timing issue as the end market demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure is strong. Networking grew but a bit less than our expected on softer demand for general purpose CPU infrastructure.Story continuesThe total data center sequential revenue decline was driven by lower sales in China, which was largely in line with our expectations, reflecting COVID and other domestic issues. With cloud adoption continuing to grow, we are serving an expanding list of fast-growing cloud service providers, including Oracle and GPU specialized CSPs. Revenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of Data Center as a whole as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, CSP customers drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Adoption of our new flagship H100 data center GPU is strong. In just the second quarter of its ramp, H100 revenue was already much higher than that of A100, which declined sequentially.This is a testament of the exceptional performance on the H100, which is as much as 9x faster than the A100 for training and up 30x faster than (ph) transformer-based large language models. The transformer engine of H100 arrived just in time to serve the development and scale out of inference of large language models. AI adoption is at an inflection point. Open AI's ChatGPT has captured interest worldwide, allowing people to experience AI firsthand and showing what's possible with generative AI. These new types of neural network models can improve productivity in a wide range of tasks, whether generating text like marketing copy, summarizing documents like , creating images for ads or video games or answering customer questions. Generative AI applications will help almost every industry do more faster.Generative large language models with over 100 billion parameters are the most advanced neural networks in today's world. NVIDIA's expertise spans across the AI supercomputers, algorithms, data processing and training methods that can bring these capabilities to enterprise. We look forward to helping customers with generative AI opportunities. In addition to working with every major hyperscale cloud provider, we are engaged with many consumer Internet companies, enterprises and start-ups. The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in the data center that will accelerate through the year. During the quarter, we made notable announcements in the financial services sector, one of our largest industry verticals. We announced a partnership with Deutsche Bank to accelerate the use of AI and machine learning in financial services.Together, we are developing a range of applications, including virtual customer service agents, speech AI, fraud detection and bank process automation, leveraging NVIDIA's full computing stack, both on-premise and in the cloud, including NVIDIA AI enterprise software. We also announced that NVIDIA captured leading results for AI inference in a key financial services industry benchmark for applications such as asset price discovery. In networking, we see growing demand for our latest generation InfiniBand and HPC optimized Ethernet platforms fueled by AI. Generative AI foundation model sizes continue to grow at exponential rates, driving the need for high-performance networking to scale out multi-node accelerated workloads. Delivering unmatched performance, latency and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand is the clear choice for power-efficient cloud scale, generative AI.For smaller scale deployments, NVIDIA is bringing its full accelerated stack expertise and integrating it with the world's most advanced high-performance Ethernet fabrics. In the quarter, InfiniBand led our growth as our Quantum 2 40 gigabit per second platform is off to a great start, driven by demand across cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers. In Ethernet, our 40 gigabit per second Spectrum 4 networking platform is gaining momentum as customers transition to higher speeds, next-generation adapters and switches. We remain focused on expanding our software and services. We released version 3.0 of NVIDIA AI enterprise with support for more than 50 NVIDIA AI frameworks and pretrained model and new workflows for contact center intelligent virtual assistance, audio transcription and cybersecurity.NVIDIA, Graphics, ChipsPhoto by Resul Kaya on UnsplashUpcoming offerings include our NeMo and BioNeMo large language model services, which are currently in early access with customers. Now to Jensen to talk a bit more about our software and cloud business.Jensen Huang: Thanks, Colette. The cumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI's versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies. Yet, the AI supercomputer infrastructure, model algorithms, data processing and training techniques remain an insurmountable obstacle for most. Today, I want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer. We are partnering with major service -- cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA AI cloud services, offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world's largest clouds.NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds. Customers can engage NVIDIA AI cloud services at the AI supercomputer, acceleration library software or pretrained AI model layers. NVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer, and the blueprint of AI factories being built around the world. AI supercomputers are hard and time-consuming to build. Today, we are announcing the NVIDIA DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer, just open your browser. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is already available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure, Google GCP and others on the way.At the AI platform software layer, customers can access NVIDIA AI enterprise for training and deploying large language models or other AI workloads. And at the pretrained generative AI model layer, we will be offering NeMo and BioNeMo, customizable AI models, to enterprise customers who want to build proprietary generative AI models and services for their businesses. With our new business model, customers can engage NVIDIA's full scale of AI computing across their private to any public cloud. We will share more details about NVIDIA AI cloud services at our upcoming GTC so be sure to tune in. Now let me turn it back to Colette on gaming.Colette Kress: Thanks, Jensen. Gaming revenue of $1.83 billion was up 16% sequentially and down 46% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $9.07 billion is down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by the strong reception of our 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of channel inventory correction, which is largely behind us. And demand in the seasonally strong fourth quarter was solid in most regions. While China was somewhat impacted by disruptions related to COVID, we are encouraged by the early signs of recovery in that market. Gamers are responding enthusiastically to the new RTX4090, 4080, 4070 Ti desktop GPUs, with many retail and online outlets quickly selling out of stock.The flagship RTX 4090 has quickly shot up in popularity on Steam to claim the top spot for the AI architecture, reflecting gamers' desire for high-performance graphics. Earlier this month, the first phase of gaming laptops based on the Ada architecture reached retail shelves, delivering NVIDIA's largest-ever generational leap in performance and power efficiency. For the first time, we are bringing enthusiast-class GPU performance to laptops as slim as 14 inches, a fast-growing segment, previously limited to basic tasks and apps. In another first, we are bringing the 90 class GPUs, our most performing models, to laptops, thanks to the power efficiency of our fifth-generation Max-Q technology. All in, RTX 40 Series GPUs will power over (ph) gaming and creator laptops, setting up for a great back-to-schools season.There are now over 400 games and applications supporting NVIDIA's RTX technology for real-time ray tracing and AI-powered graphics. The AI architecture features DLSS 3, our third-generation AI-powered graphics, which massively boosts performance. With the most advanced games, Cyberpunk 2077, recently added DLSS 3 enabling a 3 to 4x boost in frame rate performance at 4K resolution. Our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continued to expand in multiple dimensions, users, titles and performance. It now has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries. Last month, it enabled RTX 4080 graphics horsepower in the new high-performance ultimate membership tier. Ultimate members can stream at up to 240 frames per second from a cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3.And just yesterday, we made an important announcement with Microsoft. We agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring to GeForce NOW Microsoft's lineup of Xbox PC games, which includes blockbusters like Minecraft, Halo and Flight Simulator. And upon the close of Microsoft's Activision acquisition, it will add titles like Call of Duty and Overwatch. Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $226 million was up 13% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $1.54 billion was down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by desktop workstations with strengths in the automotive and manufacturing industrial verticals. Year-on-year decline reflects the impact of the channel inventory correction, which we expect to end in the first half of the year.Interest in NVIDIA's Omniverse continues to build with almost 300,000 downloads so far, 185 connectors to third-party design applications. The latest released Omniverse has a number of features and enhancements, including support for 4K, real-time path tracing, Omniverse Search for AI-powered search through large untagged 3D databases, and Omniverse cloud containers for AWS. Let's move to automotive. Revenue was a record $294 million, up 17% from and up 135% from a year ago. Sequential growth was driven primarily by AI automotive solutions. New program ramps at both electric vehicle and traditional OEM customers helped drive this growth. Fiscal year revenue of $903 million was up 60%. At CES, we announced a strategic partnership with Foxconn to develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms.This partnership will provide scale for volume, manufacturing to meet growing demand for the NVIDIA Drive platform. Foxconn will use NVIDIA Drive, Hyperion compute and sensor architecture for its electric vehicles. Foxconn will be a Tier 1 manufacturer producing electronic control units based on NVIDIA Drive Orin for the global . We also reached an important milestone this quarter. The NVIDIA Drive operating system received safety certification from TÃV SÃD, one of the most experienced and rigorous assessment bodies in the automotive industry. With industry-leading performance and functional safety, our platform meets the higher standards required for autonomous transportation. Moving to the rest of the P&amp;L. GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%.Fiscal year GAAP gross margin was 56.9%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%. Year-on-year, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were up 21%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 23%, primarily due to the higher compensation and data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were flat, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We plan to keep them relatively flat at this level over the coming quarters. Full year GAAP operating expenses were up 50%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 31%. We returned $1.15 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q4, we had approximately %7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me look to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal '24.We expect sequential growth to be driven by each of our 4 major market platforms led by strong growth in data center and gaming. Revenue is expected to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.53 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $50 million, excluding gains and losses of nonaffiliated divestments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million for the first quarter and in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year 2024.Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on March 6 in San Francisco and the Cowen Healthcare Conference on March 7 in Boston. We will also host GTC virtually with Jensen's keynote kicking off on March 21. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our first quarter of fiscal year '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 24.

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report the GPC team capped off a record setting year with a strong fourth quarter highlighted by double-digit sales and earnings growth coupled with continued margin expansion. We're incredibly proud of the progress in our operations and thankful to our teammates across the globe for their ongoing commitment to excellence. With the support of strong industry fundamentals and resilience of our automotive and industrial businesses, our teams were focused on executing key initiatives to drive sales growth faster than the market, improved gross margin and enhance operational efficiencies. As a result, we delivered in several key areas in the fourth quarter and full year.Story continuesA few highlights in the fourth quarter would include total sales of $5.5 billion up 15%. And our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth. Segment margin of 9.5%, up 80 basis points from the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 up 15% from 2021 and our 10th consecutive quarter of double digit earnings growth. For the full year, our strong quarterly performance drove record total sales of $22.1 billion up 17% which follows a 14% increase in 2021. Segment margin of 9.4% up 60 basis points from 2021. Adjusted earnings per share of $8.34 up 21% from the prior year, and a new GPC record. And strong cash flow with cash from operations up 17% and free cash flow up 14% from 2021 levels. Reflecting on the record year which followed and outstanding 2021, we are confident that our transformation efforts, including the streamlining of our businesses to an automotive and industrial centric business, along with our ongoing strategic initiatives has been highly successful.Throughout 2022, our teams have navigated the dynamics of the macro economy and have continued to deliver market share gains while delivering positive momentum across our core businesses. We continue to make significant investments in talent and technology to maximize the impact of our key initiatives. As examples, we made solid progress to advance our pricing strategies and optimize our supply chain and network footprint. Our execution in the field has proven effective in driving poor improvement in gross margin and SG&amp;A as well as parts availability, all of which provide additional opportunities for us in the future. As we build on the competitive advantages of our size and scale, we continue to look for strategic M&amp;A opportunities to further boost our product and service offerings and expand our automotive and industrial footprint.As you will hear from Will, last year's acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, has been transformational for our industrial segment. KDG had a significant impact on our industrial performance in 2022. And as elevated our capabilities as a premier industrial solutions provider. Our global automotive teams were also active with acquisitions, including geographic expansion in Europe, with the addition of operations in both Spain and Portugal. For the year, we added 138 net new stores across our global footprint, with the U.S. and Europe leading the way. Looking ahead, we have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets, and M&amp;A remains an important element of our global growth strategy. As we turn our attention to 2023. While the macro environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our strategic plans to drive ongoing market share gains, with sustained sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow.Looking at the operating environment more broadly, our automotive business is benefiting from several tailwinds, including the geographic diversity of our markets. The increase in vehicle miles driven an aging vehicle fleet and limited new car inventory. These tailwinds are driving steady levels of demand in the aftermarket, with particular strength in the DIFM segment. In industrial, we continue to see solid demand trends with new and existing customer activity and reshoring threat trends, each presenting growth opportunities. We believe this strong performance in our industrial business reflects the diversity of our product and service offerings, as well as our end markets, which all performed well in the fourth quarter. In addition, as you'll hear from Will, our growing capabilities and industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and convenience, are proving to be differentiators for our business.Collectively, we believe these strong fundamentals, combined with a rock solid balance sheet, position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to continue to pursue strategic growth opportunities through both organic and inquisitive investment, while also returning capital to shareholders. So before I close, I'd like to remind our investor community that we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor day on Thursday, March 23, here at our headquarters in Atlanta. We will be sharing more about our strategic initiatives and provide an update to our long-term financial targets. We look forward to hosting this event next month and hope to see you all here in Atlanta. We have an exceptional 2022, which included celebrating our 95th year of operations.Our accomplishments as one GPC team are evident in this milestone year. And we are proud to lead a company with such a long and rich history that differentiates GPC across all of our marketplaces. But now I'll turn the call over to Will.Will Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I also would like to thank the global GPC team for an exceptional year in 2022, and the hard work to take care of our customers every day. Around the world, our teams are aligned on our strategic initiative pillars that include talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging tech. Investment and focus in these areas translate into a better customer experience, profitable growth, operational excellence and a differentiated team culture. There in 2022, all of our teams made significant initiative progress, and we look forward to sharing more details about our progress and outlook at our upcoming investor day in March. Turning our attention to the fourth quarter performance total sales for the global automotive segment were $3.4 billion, an increase of approximately $243 million or 7.6% versus the same period in 2021.Our sales growth was consistent through the quarter with a solid finish in December to close the year. On a comparable basis automotive sales growth for the quarter increased 8.2%. Our global automotive teams delivered mid-single digit to low digit comp growth across each of our operations. As Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and team execution. For fiscal year 2022, Global Automotive segment sales was $13.7 billion, an increase of 8.9% from 2021. Global automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $295 million and segment operating margin was 8.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the same period in 2021. For the year Global Automotive segment profit was $1.2 billion and segment operating margin was 8.7%, an increase of 10 basis points from 2021 and up 110 basis points from 2019.During the fourth quarter, our automotive business experienced mid to high single digit levels of inflation, relatively consistent with the levels we saw in the second and third quarters. We continue to be pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our category management strategic initiatives. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S. automotive sales grew approximately 10% during the fourth quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Sales were strong across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories, with batteries, motor oil, tools and equipment, heavy duty and brakes all posting strong growth in the quarter. The team navigated various extreme weather events in December and kept teammates safe while taking care of customers.Both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which had low single digit growth. Our commercial business saw sales growth across all customer segments, including notable strength with our fleet and government channel and mid-single digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare Network. Over the course of the year, we grew our NAPA AutoCare Network of professional repair centers to record 18,500 customers, an increase of 670 locations, and further expanded our competitive advantage as America's largest network of parts and care. We also continue our investment in the industry as we trained over 34,000 technicians in 2022 and actively support 900 technicians in our apprenticeship program. Other select accomplishments in 2022 include investments in talent, and enhancements to our data analytics and technology capabilities.These enhancements have improved our insights and are driving data driven decisions around strategic pricing and sourcing, which has nicely contributed to margin expansion performance. We've also improved our inventory visibility and are taking action to ensure the right part is in the right place at the right time. We will continue to invest in these capabilities as we move forward. For the full year our U.S. Automotive business grew sales by approximately 11% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. We're extremely pleased with the share gains and record results in 2022. In Canada sales grew approximately 14% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 12%. The results in Canada continue to reflect solid industry fundamentals, strong team execution and market share gains.Our field oriented data analytics to assess and prioritize market customer and network opportunities has delivered returns. In partnership with global teams, the Canadian business also made progress with next drive powered by NAPA, our leading offering that positions repair shops to service hybrid and electric vehicles. In a short period of time, the program has certified over 50 EV technicians, part specialists and service advisors, with plans to have 100 certified service centers and nearly 400 trained part specialists over the next few years. For the year, our Canadian business grew sales approximately 15% in local currency, with comparable sales growth of approximately 13%. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter, with total sales increasing approximately 22% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 10%.Auto, parts, IndustryPhoto by Rahul Bhogal on UnsplashFor the year our European team delivered sales growth of 19% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. The strong growth in Europe continues to be driven by solid execution and coordinated teamwork across Europe. As examples, during 2022 our European team won business with numerous key customer accounts and continue to gain market share with the rollout of our differentiated NAPA offering across the region. Sales of NAPA product in Europe reached nearly €300 million, an annual increase of over 50% from the prior year and now positively contribute to profitability. The impressive growth is a testament to the global strength of the NAPA brand. The next drive rollout is also strong in Europe with approximately 150 certified workshops across 7 countries.In addition, our European bolt-on acquisition efforts continue to create value and expand and add density to our market footprint. Despite a challenging environment, the performance over the last few years has been strong in Europe and the momentum has continued to start 2023. In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased approximately 10% in local currency from the same period in the prior year with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. For the year, our Australian team delivered sales growth of 12% and comparable sales growth of approximately 9%. Both commercial and retail sales continued to perform well with Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories division delivering profitable growth and share gains.The team continued its impressive performance in 2022 with a 3-year sales stack of more than 30%. Repco's 100-year anniversary in 2022 marked an amazing achievement for this team, and it was only fitting that the team delivered another outstanding year. Turning to the Global Industrial segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $478 million or 29.6%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter with average daily sales growth at or above 30% for all three months of the quarter. Comparable sales growth, which excludes the benefit of KDG, increased approximately 17% in the fourth quarter versus last year. This marks our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth.As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of KDG in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, going forward, KDG sales growth will be included in comparable sales growth. The strong sales growth at Motion during the quarter was broad-based with double-digit growth across nearly all product categories and major industries served with particular strength coming from industries such as automotive, oil and gas, food products and aggregate and cement. For the year, sales at Motion were $8.4 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 33.2%. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $230 million or 11% of sales, representing a 150 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement at Motion is a result of strong and disciplined sales growth and operating performance, including the KDG synergy realization.For the year, Global Industrial segment profit was approximately $887 million, and segment operating margin was a record 10.5%, an increase of 110 basis points from 2021 and up 240 basis points from 2019. In 2022, the Industrial segment now represents over 40% of GPC total profit, up 8 percentage points since 2021. For the fourth quarter inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low single-digit range consistent with the levels we've seen throughout the year. The strong financial performance at Motion is a direct result of their customer and sales intensity, focused strategic initiatives and operating rigor. During the year, we enhanced our selling capabilities by further leveraging data and technology and continue to expand our value-added solutions offering for our customers.These solutions include products and services in categories like automation, conveyance, fluid power and repair. These categories now collectively represent approximately $1 billion in annual revenue promotion. In addition, our strategic initiatives around pricing, category management and supply chain are driving increased productivity and profitability, which is reflected in the strong margin expansion delivered in 2022. As we execute on our organic global growth initiatives, we continue to complement them with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. During the fourth quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies.We also continue to make progress in integrating our strategic acquisition of KDG with Motion. When we announced this acquisition in January of 2022, we communicated a plan for approximately $50 million in annual run rate synergies to be achieved over a 3-year period. We're pleased to report that thanks to the incredible teamwork for many, Motion realized over $30 million in synergies in just the first year with more expected in 2023 and 2024. Our acquisition pipeline is active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value. In summary, our team delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and record year for Genuine Parts Company. All our business units and geographies exceeded internal expectations, driven by supportive industry fundamentals and the focused execution of our key strategic initiatives.We're excited to build on our momentum, and we look forward to another great year in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.Bert Nappier: Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very proud of our teams and our outstanding performance, and I'm pleased to share the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year results. My comments this morning focused primarily on quarterly and full year adjusted results, which exclude nonrecurring items that I'll cover in more detail shortly. Total GPC sales were up 15% or $720 million to $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase reflects an 11.1% improvement in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation and an 8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 4.2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency, which was essentially in line with our assumption for the quarter.Sales for the full year were $22.1 billion, up 17.1% from 2021. As we continue to invest in organic and acquisitive growth initiatives for both of our segments, it was encouraging to see our core business combined with acquisitions, including KDG, which added more than $1 billion in revenues for 2022 drive strong sales throughout the year. Our gross margin expanded approximately 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 35.7%, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our pricing and sourcing initiatives that Will mentioned. These initiatives, along with others, contributed approximately 160 basis points of core gross margin improvement. These gains were partially offset by a few key factors: first, moderating year-over-year supplier incentives pressured gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; second, a shift in the mix of our sales based on the strength of our industrial business impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; finally, foreign currency and inflation impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points.With a strong fourth quarter, gross margin for the full year was 35.1%, slightly above our expectations and essentially in line with the prior year. Our performance on gross margin reflects an excellent job by our team, executing our strategies given the very dynamic market challenges. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the fourth quarter, excluding adjustments, were approximately $1.6 billion, up 16.6% from 2021 and a 28.7% of sales compared to 28.3% of sales in the prior year. Our expenses were up in the quarter, primarily due to inflation-driven increases in freight costs and overall investments in IT initiatives across our business units. For the year, total expenses were $6.2 billion, up 16.2% at a 27.9% of sales, a 20 basis point improvement from 2021.Despite ongoing cost pressures in the fourth quarter, we continue to drive leverage on strong core sales growth across our businesses and execute on our initiatives to produce operational efficiencies. Segment profit in the fourth quarter was $526 million, up 25%, and our segment profit margin was 9.5%, an impressive 80 basis point increase from the same period in 2021. For the full year, segment profit was $2.1 billion, up 25% on a 17% sales increase. Our segment profit margin was 9.4%, a 60 basis point improvement from the prior year and up 160 basis points from 2019, which we believe demonstrates our transformation to an even stronger company and our ability to consistently perform through dynamic economic conditions. As outlined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter results include three adjustments.The first item relates to a $29 million adjustment to remeasure our product liability reserve. Secondly, we incurred approximately $13 million of costs related to the acquisition and integration of KDG. The third item relates to an $11 million loss on the divestiture of our remaining minority interest investment in S.P. Richards, which was finalized in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our non-recurring items include these fourth quarter adjustments as well as the 12-month impact of costs related to KDG and a gain on the sale of certain real estate recorded in the second quarter. Our fourth quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share in nonrecurring items I just discussed, was $292 million or $2.05 per diluted share.This compares to adjusted net income of $256 million or $1.79 per diluted share in 2021, an increase of 15%. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $8.34 per diluted share, an increase of 21% from 2021. Reported net income was $1.2 billion or $8.31 per diluted share. The continued execution of our initiatives allowed us to deliver back-to-back double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2022 and 2021. With strong earnings growth and improved working capital, we generated $222 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year, a 17% increase from 2021. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up 14% from 2021, and we closed the fourth quarter and year with $2.2 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times and highlights our financial strength and flexibility.Our strong performance has allowed us to stay focused on four key priorities for capital allocation, including the reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&amp;A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the year, we invested $340 million in capital expenditures, including $96 million in the fourth quarter, primarily in technology and other projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity. We also invested $3 billion investment in KDG and returned $719 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $496 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $223 million in cash used to repurchase 1.6 million shares.Our continued strong cash flow generation provides us the ability to manage our capital allocation through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.80 to $8.95, which represents an increase of 6% to 7% from adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2022. Our outlook for earnings growth is driven by our expectations for continuous sales growth and another year of margin expansion. We expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. As we look at the business segments, we are guiding to the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with a 4% to 6% increase in comparable sales.We would add that our outlook for Industrial assumes a much stronger first half relative to the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Turning to a few other items of interest. We will continue to drive growth through the reinvestment in our business and M&amp;A. We currently expect CapEx to be in the range of $375 million to $400 million in 2023, reflecting incremental opportunities in technology and supply chain, among others. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets, and we'll continue to seek additional bolt-on acquisitions wherever they create value for us. In 2023, we will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.80 per share annual dividend for 2023, representing our 67th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.This represents a 6% increase from the $3.58 per share paid in 2022 and is above our 20-year average increase of 5.8%. Our total shareholder return performance of approximately 27% in 2022 placed GPC in the top 10% of the S&amp;P 500. Taken together, we delivered sales growth of 17% and adjusted EPS growth of 21%, so a tremendous year in 2022. Our teams worked hard for these achievements, and we enter 2023 with strong momentum and are well positioned to continue to take share and deliver through an uncertain macro environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the year. In closing, as both Paul and Will have mentioned, we look forward to hosting our Investor Day on March 23. We are excited to provide further insights on key growth initiatives, and long-term financial targets and are confident you will find the day informative and productive.We'd love to see you here in Atlanta. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.See also 11 Most Profitable Chinese Stocks and 15 Most Profitable New Stocks Today.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the energy sector, its previous performance, and outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Invest In. The energy sector in the US remained stable in 2022 due to high prices and tight supplies. The sector ended the year with record gains, soaring 58% as of December 30, compared with a roughly 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500. According to Dow Jones Market Data, this was the first time ever for the energy sector to emerge as a solo winner of the S&amp;P 500 calendar year. Moreover, it was the benchmark’s only sector that did not decline during the year.One of the main factors that contributed to the solid performance of the energy sector last year was the rising oil and gas prices. Analysts are expecting the trend to continue this year as well. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for OANDA in New York, talked to Fox Business about the energy industry’s outlook for 2023. He asserted that many geo-political tensions could still keep the oil and gas prices elevated this year. He further mentioned that though fluctuating market conditions could not reveal a clear picture, the energy sector is still in a good shape amid a slow global economy.The outperformance of the energy industry is driving investors toward the sector as energy companies have steadily raised their dividends over the last 12 months, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report also mentioned that these payouts would still hold an effect even if the economy enters a recession. In addition to this, investors also tend to focus on companies that have strong free cash flow generation. According to a report by Fidelity, free cash flow yields in the energy industry were at their all-time high relative to the broader market at the end of 2022. Moreover, many energy companies have significantly reduced their debts over the past two years and are now returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:OKE) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 70% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-nyse-oke-favoured-144345207.html,1677336225,STORY,['OKE'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in ONEOK implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockTo get a sense of who is truly in control of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 70% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of ONEOK. See our latest analysis for ONEOK ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ONEOK?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.ONEOK already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see ONEOK's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. ONEOK is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 11% and 7.3% of the stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of ONEOKThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of ONEOK, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$201m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand ONEOK better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - ONEOK has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit concerning)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

80,9c6e9414-54ae-3a21-a54c-ba9b89b865cd,MTB,2023-02-26,Here's What We Like About M&T Bank's (NYSE:MTB) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-m-t-banks-nyse-123545138.html,1677414945,STORY,['MTB-PH'],"[It looks like M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase M&amp;T Bank's shares on or after the 3rd of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.80 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that M&amp;T Bank has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current share price of $156.13. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether M&amp;T Bank's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see M&amp;T Bank paying out a modest 41% of its earnings.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see M&amp;T Bank earnings per share are up 5.1% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, M&amp;T Bank has increased its dividend at approximately 5.5% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayHas M&amp;T Bank got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. M&amp;T Bank ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example - M&amp;T Bank has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds. Investors are regaining confidence in the stock market as the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 4.92% year-to-date return. Moreover, global inflation is likely to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023,  as reported by International Monetary Fund in January. The report also mentioned that 84% of countries are expected to experience lower headline inflation this year as compared to 2022. Considering this positive outlook of the market, investors show an inclination toward stocks that would help them achieve stable regular income. In this regard, dividend-focused companies with strong dividend growth track records remain popular among investors.Dividend growers have historically outperformed their peers, becoming top choices for investors. According to a report by Merrill Edge, an American financial services company, dividend stocks can help to alleviate portfolio losses when stock prices fall. The report further highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — stocks that have raised their dividend for 25 years or more — delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market. In addition to this, dividend stocks reflected a volatility of 13.22%, in contrast with a 14.22% volatility for the S&amp;P 500.Analysts expect that dividend stocks will be able to maintain their performance in 2023 as well. According to UBS, dividends per share in the S&amp;P 500 will grow by 1% this year, even with a potential 11% decline in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The financial services company also estimated that dividends per share could grow by 20% in the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids a recession.Story continuesMcDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some of the most important companies that have raised their dividends for a significant period of time. Moreover, these companies have strong cash flow generation that promises further dividend growth. In view of these arguments, we will discuss the dividend aristocrats that are popular among hedge funds.S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund PopularityTechnology share chartOur Methodology:Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have increased their dividends consistently over the past 25 consecutive years. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 15 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund Popularity15. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57A California-based energy company, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) specializes in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company posted revenue of $56.4 billion, which showed a 17.3% growth from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company paid nearly $11 billion to shareholders in dividends.On January 25, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) declared a 6.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.51 per share. This marked the company's 36th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of February 24, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.77%.

(NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL).In January, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) authorized the repurchase of the company's common stock worth $75 billion. Given this, Truist raised its price target on the stock in February to $179 and maintained a Hold rating on the shares.At the end of December 2022, 57 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), down from 66 in the previous quarter. However, the value of these stakes grew to $32.2 billion this quarter, from $27.1 billion a quarter earlier.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational healthcare company that develops medical devices. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.29%, as of February 24. It maintains a 45-year streak of consistent dividend growth.Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds as 58 elite funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q4 2022, up from 55 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 in February and maintained a Hold rating on the shares, highlighting the company's solid recent quarterly earnings.Artisan Partners mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American multinational beverage corporation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is next on our list of top dividend stocks among hedge funds. It offers a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, having raised it by 4.5% on February 16. This marked the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth.

The collective value of these stakes is over $28.8 billion. With 400 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company, based in Illinois. In January, Barclays raised its price target on the stock to $125 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's medical device growth.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds, currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a renewable energy company, based in Florida, US. On February 17, the company declared a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.4675 per share. This increase took the company's dividend growth streak to 27 years.

(NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) specializes in the production of painting and coating material.

Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Lowe's Companies, Inc.

It maintains a 50-year streak of consistent dividend growth.In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some other popular dividend stocks favored by investors.As of the close of Q4 2022, 70 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), worth over $4.4 billion collectively.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:15 Best Oil Stocks to Buy10 Small Cap SaaS Stocks Hedge Funds are Piling Into13 Most Profitable Food StocksDisclosure.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the energy sector, its previous performance, and outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Invest In. The energy sector in the US remained stable in 2022 due to high prices and tight supplies. The sector ended the year with record gains, soaring 58% as of December 30, compared with a roughly 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500. According to Dow Jones Market Data, this was the first time ever for the energy sector to emerge as a solo winner of the S&amp;P 500 calendar year. Moreover, it was the benchmark’s only sector that did not decline during the year.One of the main factors that contributed to the solid performance of the energy sector last year was the rising oil and gas prices. Analysts are expecting the trend to continue this year as well. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for OANDA in New York, talked to Fox Business about the energy industry’s outlook for 2023. He asserted that many geo-political tensions could still keep the oil and gas prices elevated this year. He further mentioned that though fluctuating market conditions could not reveal a clear picture, the energy sector is still in a good shape amid a slow global economy.The outperformance of the energy industry is driving investors toward the sector as energy companies have steadily raised their dividends over the last 12 months, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report also mentioned that these payouts would still hold an effect even if the economy enters a recession. In addition to this, investors also tend to focus on companies that have strong free cash flow generation. According to a report by Fidelity, free cash flow yields in the energy industry were at their all-time high relative to the broader market at the end of 2022. Moreover, many energy companies have significantly reduced their debts over the past two years and are now returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), NextEra Energy, Inc.

By dictating its terms, W.P. Carey CEO Jason Fox said that the company may negotiate 19.9-year terms for new deals. This increases the visibility of cash flow and locks in the cap rates. Both factors give investors the confidence that dividends will remain at 5% and could rise in the coming years.People want to push back on inflation-linked increases. However, W.P. Carey has strong negotiating leverage.

As technologies become more advanced, AI and machine learning protocols can help radically improve productivity. In addition, they can cut down on errors, leading to greater efficiencies and safer operations.From the economic angle, AI stocks present an extraordinarily compelling case. According to Grand View Research, the global AI market size reached a valuation of $136.55 billion in 2022. Experts there project that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. At the end of the forecasted period, sector revenue should come in at $1.81 trillion.Nevertheless, with so much competition in the space, it’s difficult to know which AI stocks to target. Like any promising industry, some enterprises may do very well. Others may end up being duds. While it’s no guarantee of success, betting alongside Wall Street experts could improve your odds. Each of the AI stocks below features at least a moderate buy consensus rating. As well, they all enjoy double-digit forecasted gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsORCLOracle$86.32MSFTMicrosoft$251.51NOWServiceNow$439.84SSentinelOne$15.78GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$91.80CRWDCrowdStrike$117.63AMZNAmazon$95.75Oracle (ORCL)Illustration of hand pointing finger about to touch virtual ""AI"" graphicSource: shutterstock.com/Den RiseA computer technology specialist, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) sells database software and technology, cloud-engineered systems, and enterprise software products. Through its AI and machine learning (ML) infrastructures, developers and data scientists can build custom applications and operational architectures. Over the trailing year, ORCL gained over 16% of equity value.Presently, the tech firm offers a compelling deal for investors seeking a fundamentally cheap player among established enterprises. The market prices ORCL at a forward multiple of 15.41 times. As a discount to earnings, Oracle ranks better than 72.28% of the software industry. Additionally, the company benefits from a strong three-year revenue growth rate (12.9%) and a top-notch net margin (19.09%). Both stats rate higher than their respective median values.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street gives its nod of approval for Oracle, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $97.63, implying over 13% upside potential. Thus, ORCL represents one of the AI stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)Close-up of letters ""AI"" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocksSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK VOne of the top tech firms, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested heavily in the AI space. Mainly, the company backs OpenAI, the enterprise responsible for the popular chatbot ChatGPT. Recently, Microsoft announced that it integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. More synergies may be on the way, offering considerable excitement among AI stocks.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), MSFT rates as modestly undervalued. Operationally, the case for MSFT as one of the AI stocks to buy becomes patently evident. Its three-year revenue growth rate of 17.4% outpaces 72.37% of the competition. Further, its net margin of over 33% beats out 96.7% of the software sector.At the moment, Wall Street analysts peg MSFT as a strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $291.70, implying over 15% upside potential. As a small bonus, Microsoft also carries a modest forward yield of 1.08%.ServiceNow (NOW)Graphic of front profile of artificial face in pinkish-red hue with binary code and symbols surrounding it, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocksSource: shutterstock.com/local_doctorA software specialist, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) develops a cloud computing platform to help companies manage digital workflows for enterprise operations. Further, the company offers Now Intelligence, a platform that makes predictions and automates repetitive tasks for enhanced productivity. Since the January opener, NOW gained a remarkable 12%.To be fair, NOW lost 21.5% of equity value in the trailing year. However, that might make NOW an intriguing bargain. According to Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations, NOW represents a significantly undervalued investment.Objectively, ServiceNow enjoys significant operational strengths. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 26.6%, ranking higher than 82.61% of its peers. Also, its net margin pings at 4.49%, above 60.73% of the industry. Not to be ignored, ServiceNow’s balance sheet offers something of interest. Its Altman Z-Score hit 7.21, reflecting a very low bankruptcy risk. Finally, the company represents one of the AI stocks that Wall Street loves with its consensus strong buy assessment. Plus, analysts’ price target stands at $514.70, implying over 19% upside potential.SentinelOne (S)Financial technology concept. Stock chart. Investment. Fintech. artificial intelligence stocks under $10Source: metamorworks / Shutterstock.comA cybersecurity firm, SentinelOne (NYSE:S) cynically benefits from an expanding market. With cyber-crimes rising in scope and scale – while imposing devastating costs to enterprises – having digital protection has never been more important. Further, SentinelOne uses machine learning for monitoring personal computers, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and cloud workloads.To be fair, SentinelOne represents more of an aspirational trade. For instance, while it features strong gross margins, both its operating and net margins rate well into negative territory. Objectively, shares trade at a trailing multiple of 11.67, which is extremely overvalued. Presently, the industry median is only 2.49.However, the cybersecurity specialist features a strong balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio stands at 25.31 times, outpacing nearly 73% of the competition. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 4.42, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. As for the subject of this article, S definitely represents one of the AI stocks that Wall Street loves. It features a moderate buy consensus view and a price target that implies a 28% upside potential.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)BZFD stock. blue graphic of person's face made of binary code and microchip lines.Source: shutterstock.com/PeshkovaWhile tech juggernaut Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) may have taken a beating last year, here’s the good news: it runs in the market as a relatively discounted trade today. As for its AI cred, the whole enterprise eats and sleeps AI and machine learning. From providing greater utility and better recommendations with its Google ecosystem to promoting self-driving cars, Alphabet does it all.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, Alphabet ranks as a significantly undervalued investment. Objectively, the company enjoys significant operational strengths. Despite its well-established business, Alphabet still offers significant growth. Over the past three years, revenue jumped higher to the tune of 22.9%, outpacing nearly 74% of its peers.On the bottom line, Alphabet’s net margin stands at 21.2%, beating out over 83% of its rivals. As well, it benefits from balance sheet stability. Specifically, its Altman Z-Score pings at 9.14, reflecting very low bankruptcy risk. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg GOOG as a consensus strong buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $124.60, implying over 35% upside potential.CrowdStrike (CRWD)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution. BBAI stockSource: ShutterstockAnother cybersecurity-related example of AI stocks to buy, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cloud workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence and cyberattack response services. According to its website, CrowdStrike harnesses world-class AI and machine learning to detect and prevent modern threats with the speed and scale of the cloud. Since the January opener, CRWD gained nearly 9% of its equity value.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, CrowdStrike is significantly undervalued. Financially, the greatest strengths center on its operational stats. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 63.6%, outpacing 95% of the competition. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period hit 26.1%, beating out over 71% of peers. To be fair, its net margin currently sits below breakeven. However, the company enjoys a decent balance sheet. Its Altman Z-Score is 5.53, sitting in the safe zone regarding bankruptcy risk. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg CRWD as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $160.26, implying almost 43% upside potential.Amazon (AMZN)MSFTSource: ShutterstockAfter getting torn to shreds last year, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) might rank among AI stocks to buy. However, it’s risky as I’ll explain below. Earning its reputation as an e-commerce juggernaut, Amazon over the years entered into the AI space. Per its website, the company’s AWS cloud platform offers the broadest and deepest set of AI and machine learning services.While AMZN gained over 10% since the January opener, in the trailing year, it’s down 37%. However, this dynamic presents risks and rewards. On the former side, Gurufocus.com warns its readers that AMZN represents a possible value trap.However, on the flip side, Amazon still ranks among the growth machines. Its three-year sales growth rate stands at 21.9%, beating out over 84% of the competition. Further, after losing three quarters worth of negative free cash flow, this metric went strongly positive in the fourth quarter. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg AMZN as a strong buy, warts and all. Plus, their average price target stands at $137.05, implying nearly 45% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Tech firms generally reinvest their profits back into the business and seek growth rather than returning capital to shareholders through dividends. That said, many tech companies pay dividends. These dividends attract investors who like the steady income dividends represent.Investing in dividend-paying tech stocks provides the benefits of regular income and potential capital appreciation. Tech stocks have been one of the fastest-growing sectors over the past few decades. Although the past year has been tough on the sector, most investors expect it to rebound long term. The dividends these shares include provide income while the sector normalizes.TickerCompanyPriceIBMIBM$131.71CSCOCisco$49.69TXNTexas Instruments$170.76MSFTMicrosoft$252.67AAPLApple$148.48ORCLOracle$86.20QCOMQualcomm$123.70InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock represents a technology company often cited for its dividend. The company offers a range of hardware, software, and services. IBM is particularly well-known as a leader in enterprise computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The company boasts a diverse customer base that includes governments, businesses, and individuals and operates globally.IBM might be a controversial pick to lead this list, as the stock has shown weak returns over the past decade. In fact, $1,000 invested in its shares would only have grown to $1,024 today(1). But that return does not include IBM’s dividend, which has not been reduced since 1994. That dividend currently yields 4.9%, which is an impressive rate across all stocks, particularly so within the tech sector.IBM has real growth prospects moving forward. The company is a leader in artificial intelligence (AI). There’s every chance that the company’s recent performance could change due to AI.Story continuesCisco (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock is another well-known tech name with a substantial dividend. The company provides networking hardware, software, and services. Cisco sells products and services, including routers, switches, security systems, and cloud services. Cisco’s shares have appreciated in 2023 after falling from $55 to $47 throughout 2022.Cisco shares currently trade near $50, with analyst consensus suggesting they should appreciate roughly 10% over the next 12-18 months based on the target price. Cisco recently delivered strong results with 7% sales growth topping expectations. In turn, management increased guidance for the full year. The positive news is a bright spot within tech, as many firms are bracing for negative earnings news.Cisco’s revenues increased 7% to $13.59 billion in the quarter, and the company expects current fiscal-year growth to be between 9% and 10.5% year-over-year. Those results and expectations prove that tech growth is far from over. Cisco’s dividend has not been reduced since 2011 and recent strong results indicate that will continue to be the case.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a semiconductor design and manufacturing company serving multiple industries. Its products include digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and power management solutions, among others. The company’s latest dividend equaled $1.24, yielding 2.82% for its holders.Texas Instruments reported earnings in late January with earnings per share of $2.13. That EPS was well above the $1.98 consensus Wall Street was expecting. So, from that perspective, Texas Instruments did well. Despite beating expectations, revenues still decreased by 3% on a year-over-year basis and fell 11% sequentially.There were several bright spots in the report aside from the higher-than-anticipated EPS. Texas Instruments reported $5.9 billion in free cash flow for the year on $20.03 billion in sales. It also returned $7.9 billion to shareholders, showing its commitment to income investors. Further, automotive demand increased, a potential point of strength moving forward.Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft and Activision Blizzard logo on smartphone screen close-upSource: FellowNeko / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is one of the most well-known tech shares. The company has also been paying dividends to its shareholders for nearly two decades. The company has a strong balance sheet and consistent cash flows, which allows it to offer a reliable and growing dividend. The company has a track record of increasing its dividend payout and has done so every quarter since its inception in 2003.In 2022, Microsoft paid its shareholders $2.54 in dividends per share. While that equates to a relatively low yield of 1%, it’s exceptionally sustainable, judging from the dividend’s 0.28 payout ratio. That stable dividend has grown at a rate of 9.7% over the past five years, which is another positive sign overall.Sales at Microsoft grew by a relatively low 2% in the most recent quarter. Increasing costs and decreasing operating income led to a net income of $16.4 billion during the period, down 12%. But rapid cloud revenue growth and a resurgent LinkedIn were strong points for the firm. A rebound seems highly likely for MSFT, and growth is a near certainty for one of the strongest firms in the world.Apple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.Source: Moab Republic / ShutterstockApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has grown at an astronomical 26.75% annually over the past decade. Growth at such a prolific rate is usually a consequence of reinvesting everything back into the company. Thus, investors might not expect that Apple has been steadily rewarding investors with a dividend during that period. However, it has.The company reinstituted its dividend in 2012 and hasn’t reduced it since. It is also worth noting that Apple paid a dividend from 1987 until 1995 worth 1/10th of a cent. That dividend is now 23 cents per share and has grown by 8.2% over the past five years.Like Microsoft, investing in Apple is a bet that flagging tech giants will rebound and reward current investors handsomely. Apple’s Q1 revenues fell 5%, which has signaled that demand may be shrinking as consumers buckle down in the currently volatile economy. As consumers appear less likely to shell out large sums for iPhones, the company is leaning on services where revenues hit an all-time high of $20.8 billion.Oracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.comOracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock represents a multinational technology company that provides database and enterprise software products and services along with cloud services. The company is known for its range of software solutions for business, supply chain, and human resources management. Oracle is also investing heavily in cloud services, focusing on helping customers and enterprises move their workloads to the cloud.In regards to dividends, Oracle has paid a dividend that has gone unreduced since its inception in 2009. It currently yields 1.46% and has grown 14% over the past five years.Wall Street expects mid-term growth from Oracle and has assigned its a consensus $95 stock price target. ORLC shares currently trade for $87.Oracle’s revenues increased by 18% in 2022, suggesting that long-term growth shouldn’t be a problem. Net income did decrease, however, falling by 12% during the period. Oracle is also a significant force in the cloud and is spending heavily to lure customers away from bigger tech companies in the space.Qualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquartersSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Qualcomm is another semiconductor stock that includes a dividend. The company has benefited from the growth of smartphones and 5G technology. It is a noted supplier of Apple, so as Apple shifts toward in-house chip production, investors have grown skeptical of Qualcomm’s prospects.The company’s most recent earnings do little to assuage those concerns, with revenues that declined by 12% to $9.46 billion. However, those results were in line with management’s expectations.However, there is reason to believe in Qualcomm moving forward. Apple is unlikely to move away from Qualcomm as a supplier until late 2024 at the earliest. Apple’s efforts to develop in-house chip production have not gone to plan, as the company was hoping to bring production in-house this year. That leaves the door open for Qualcomm while it continues to grow in other areas. In particular, IoT and automotive, where revenues increased by 7% and 58% YoY in the latest quarter.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:FIS). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$77.81 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$61.41. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Fidelity National Information Services' current trading price of US$64.90 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Fidelity National Information Services’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services Is Fidelity National Information Services Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Fidelity National Information Services is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $82.78, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Fidelity National Information Services’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from Fidelity National Information Services?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Fidelity National Information Services, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting top-line growth of 8.3% in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since FIS is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FIS for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy FIS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you'd like to know more about Fidelity National Information Services as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

If you want to see more high growth high margin stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Buy.High margin stocks have higher margins than average by a fair margin.Generally, maintaining substantially higher than average margins in the long term is difficult given competition.If there is a new opportunity given a new market or a new technological development, a company that captures that opportunity might have few competitors and high margins temporarily. When more firms join and there is more competition, however, margins can decline. With more competition, the firm might have to spend more on advertising, its costs could increase, or it might have to lower the price of its products, all of which could lead to narrower margins.While higher than average margins tend to decrease over time given competition, some companies have higher margins than average either for temporary reasons or for more competitive advantage reasons.Some companies have higher margins for temporary reasons.If oil prices rise considerably, for instance, some oil companies are going to have higher margins than companies in some other industries simply because oil prices have risen a lot. The same, of course, is also true. If oil prices decline, those companies could have lower margins.Some companies have higher margins given they have competitive advantages such as strong brands. Because companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have strong brands, they can charge more for their products than companies that make comparable products can. Because they have similar costs and higher price points, companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have higher margins.There are different types of margins such as gross margins, operating margins, and profit margins. Although all are important, profit margins are arguably the most important for many investors as EPS can lead to dividends or share buybacks if a company has excess capital and management decides to return the excess capital back to shareholders.Story continuesWhat is high, average, and low margin differs based on industry, time period, and also what type of margin it is. For the stocks listed in this article, we define companies with profit margins of over 15% as having high margin. The average profit margin can vary from time to time but is generally considered around 10% give or take several percentage points. Some might think 20% is high profit margin but everyone's definition is different.High GrowthHigh growth companies have different definitions for different people. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.The expected growth rate of a company can change depending on where the economy is in the economic cycle.In terms of where the economy is in the current economic cycle, it is uncertain. Unemployment is low and GDP is growing but the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates considerably and will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, the economy could slow considerably or even enter into a recession. If the economy slows too much, the broader market could go lower and earnings growth might underperform.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Real Estate, BuildingPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 11 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Buy, we selected 11 stocks with competitive advantages with profit margins higher than 15% and EPS Next 5 Year Ratio higher than 10% according to FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Since it is an estimate, the EPS Next 5 Year Ratio can change from time to time depending on economic developments, company specific developments, and analyst views.Given economic and corporate developments, profit margins will also change, sometimes substantially from quarter to quarter given many factors, including potentially one time factors, affect net income.

Moreover, global inflation is likely to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023,  as reported by International Monetary Fund in January.

Considering this positive outlook of the market, investors show an inclination toward stocks that would help them achieve stable regular income. In this regard, dividend-focused companies with strong dividend growth track records remain popular among investors.Dividend growers have historically outperformed their peers, becoming top choices for investors. According to a report by Merrill Edge, an American financial services company, dividend stocks can help to alleviate portfolio losses when stock prices fall. The report further highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — stocks that have raised their dividend for 25 years or more — delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market. In addition to this, dividend stocks reflected a volatility of 13.22%, in contrast with a 14.22% volatility for the S&amp;P 500.Analysts expect that dividend stocks will be able to maintain their performance in 2023 as well.

However, the value of these stakes grew to $32.2 billion this quarter, from $27.1 billion a quarter earlier.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX).

Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational healthcare company that develops medical devices. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.29%, as of February 24. It maintains a 45-year streak of consistent dividend growth.Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds as 58 elite funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q4 2022, up from 55 in the previous quarter.

Here is what the firm has to say:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American multinational beverage corporation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is next on our list of top dividend stocks among hedge funds.

With 400 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company, based in Illinois. In January, Barclays raised its price target on the stock to $125 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's medical device growth.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds, currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a renewable energy company, based in Florida, US.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

(NASDAQ:PEP), worth over $4.4 billion collectively.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:15 Best Oil Stocks to Buy10 Small Cap SaaS Stocks Hedge Funds are Piling Into13 Most Profitable Food StocksDisclosure.

95,917d6b79-7d51-32aa-800c-4c90afaee56c,AXP,2023-02-26,Highlights from Berkshire Hathaway's annual report and Warren Buffett's letter,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/highlights-berkshire-hathaways-annual-report-132831045.html,1677331711,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'AXP']","[By Daniel ShvartsmanInvesting.com -- Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) (NYSE:BRKb), the Warren Buffett-led insurance and industrial conglomerate, reported record operating earnings in 2022 even as its net income line showed deep losses due to the bear market on Wall Street last year.Berkshire Hathaway’s operating earnings, which is Buffett’s preferred figure to measure the company’s growth as it is adjusted to remove net capital gains or losses during the year, was $30.79B, 12.2% above 2021’s figure. GAAP net income came in as a loss of $22.8B. In his annual letter to shareholders that came out Saturday, Buffett reiterated his preference to focus on operating earnings, saying that capital gains’ “quarter-by-quarter gyrations, regularly and mindlessly headlined by media, totally misinform investors.”Indeed, Berkshire Hathaway’s book value also dropped in 2022, with the drop in Berkshire’s equity securities’ value amounting to more than the book value drop.Berkshire Hathaway’s annual report, Buffett’s annual letter, and Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in May are all hotly followed as indicators of the state of the economy, both given Buffett’s accumulated insight into the state of the economy – with his partner and Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger – and Berkshire Hathaway’s conglomerate nature, which offers read-throughs to the wider economy.Here are some highlights from Buffett’s letter and the report:In defense of capitalism, the U.S., and Berkshire’s corporate citizenshipBuffett’s letter was short on comments about his portfolio, the post-Buffett future of Berkshire Hathaway, or whether the market is more fairly valued after saying ‘little excites us’ a year ago.Instead, he seemed to make a philosophical and political argument. Buffett made clear the value of share buybacks, noting that Berkshire Hathaway reduced the share count 1.2% from the 2021 annual report to the 2022 annual report (buying back $7.85 billion in shares in 2022) to the benefit of shareholders. But he also stated that, “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive),” pushing back on criticism but also perhaps the calls for increased taxes on share buybacks.Story continuesBuffett also spent a section of the letter pointing out that Berkshire paid $32 billion in corporate taxes in the decade ending 2021, amounting to .1% of all federal taxes collected in that period, as a reminder that Berkshire is doing its part. This, combined with his praise of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders who tend to donate their wealth to charity, amounted to defense of Berkshire’s position in the U.S. social fabric.He coupled that with his continued defense of America, however, saying, “I have yet to see a time when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America. And I doubt very much that any reader of this letter will have a different experience in the future.”A turning point for GEICO?Berkshire’s insurance businesses ended up posting a $90 million loss for the year, but Q4 marked a gain of $234 million. GEICO has been the main cause of the loss as compared to past years, struggling with pricing amidst increased claims severity (in part related to used car price inflation).The auto insurer still lost $440M in Q4, but this was a narrowing compared to Q3. The report cited a reduction in underwriting expenses related to less advertising, an 8.9% drop in policies in force for the year, and an 11.3% increase in average premium pricing for the year. This suggests GEICO is competing less for less-profitable business and adjusting to the increased severity. Throw in any moderation for used car inflation – claims severities were up 14-16% for collision and 21-22% for property damage – and GEICO may have a stronger 2023.Berkshire at least thinks so, saying it expects an underwriting profit for the year from the unit.Inflation Vs. RecessionBerkshire’s various businesses struggled with cost inflation and lessening volumes while also benefiting from price inflation. The question is whether those dynamics continue, or whether a recession or conversely a soft landing plays out.Berkshire’s railroad segment grew revenues 11.9% but operating earnings drop 2.4% and net earnings drop .7% due to this prices up but costs up and volumes down dynamic. The energy and utilities business grew earnings by 9.3%, and the manufacturing segment grew earnings 12.5%. But in regard to the latter, the firm wrote that, “demand began to weaken in the second half of the year at certain of our businesses.”The importance of long-term investingWhile Buffett didn’t comment much on Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio positions, he talked about the secret sauce to their investment strategy: long-term thinking, and focus.Buffett cited Berkshire’s positions in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), where the buying was mostly done in 1994 and 1995 for $1.3 billion each, and which now return dividends to Berkshire of a combined $1 billion (a 38.5% yield on cost). Pleasing, but “far from spectacular”, Buffett wrote. The key is the capital appreciation, as he noted that each position amounts to 5% of Berkshire’s current net worth, at $25 billion (Coke) and $22 billion (Amex) respectively.Buffett’s conclusion: “The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.”This might explain why the firm's most recent form 13F filing didn't contain many fireworks: not everything happens in a given quarter.Catch up on historic statistics about Berkshire Hathaway.Related ArticlesHighlights from Berkshire Hathaway's annual report and Warren Buffett's letterWarren Buffett, in annual letter, stays upbeat and preaches patienceHighlights from Berkshire Hathaway's annual report and Warren Buffett's letter]"

(NASDAQ:NTAP) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.50 per share on the 26th of April. This means the annual payment is 3.1% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for NetApp NetApp's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, NetApp's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 48.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could reach 76%, which is definitely on the higher side.historic-dividendNetApp Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.60, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that NetApp has grown earnings per share at 151% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.We Really Like NetApp's DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, NetApp has 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

I'll now turn the call over to George.George Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In Q3, we executed well on the elements under our control in the face of a weakening IT spending environment and continued cloud cost optimization. Disciplined operational management yielded operating margin and EPS that exceeded expectations, despite revenue coming in at the low end of our guidance. We are delivering on our commitments and responding to the dynamic environment. We adjusted our cost structure, introduced a portfolio of capacity-flash arrays to support cost sensitive customers, and continue to work with our customers to help them optimize their cloud spending. On today's call, I will discuss our Q3 results in the context of the current environment and our plans to sharpen our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our long-term position.We continued to see increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and some deals pushing out. We are feeling this most acutely in large enterprise and the Americas tech and service provider sectors. Customers are looking to stretch their budget dollars, sweating assets, shifting spend to hybrid flash and capacity flash arrays from higher-cost performance flash arrays and, as our cloud partners have described, optimizing cloud spending. We saw signs of a softening environment early in fiscal year 23 and took swift action to control costs, with increased scrutiny of program spending, a hiring slowdown in Q2, and a hiring freeze in Q3. At the start of Q4, we implemented a workforce reduction of approximately 8%.Decisions that impact our employees are always difficult. I take great pride in fostering the NetApp culture and am committed to using this difficult action to refocus our team, guided by the values and mission of the Company. Our hybrid flash and QLC-based all-flash arrays continue to perform well, benefiting from customers' price sensitivity in this challenging macro. The shift from high-performance all-flash arrays to lower cost solutions, coupled with the lower spending environment, especially among large enterprise, and U.S. tech and service provider customers who are large consumers of flash, created headwinds to our product and all-flash array revenues. In Q3, our all-flash array business decreased 12% from Q3 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion.Public Cloud ARR of $605 million did not meet our expectations, driven by a shortfall in cloud storage as a result of the same factors we experienced last quarter. Spending optimization and the winding down of project-based workloads like chip design, EDA, and HPC were headwinds again in Q3. We have a sizable base of public cloud customers, with a number of large customers who have grown rapidly over the past year and are now optimizing. Their cost optimizations mask the growth of other customers. We continue to add new customers and churn has remained consistently low. Overall, the CloudOps portfolio performed to plan. Cloud Insights has stabilized, and Spot continues to grow nicely, benefiting from the cost optimization trend. Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate decreased to 120% but is still within healthy industry norms.We are confident that we remain well positioned to take advantage of the secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We are aligned to customers' top priorities and have demonstrated success in controlling the elements within our control. Building on that solid foundation, we are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results while strengthening our position for when the spending environment rebounds. We have three areas of focus: First, we will remain prudent stewards of the business and will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control. Second, we are reinvigorating efforts across the Company in support of our storage business. Third, we are building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business.Starting with the first area of focus, remaining prudent stewards of the business and managing the elements within our control. We will maintain our focus on cost controls so that expenses do not grow ahead of revenue. We will achieve this by maintaining our scrutiny on program spending and hiring, as well as focusing our investments on the products that represent the biggest opportunity. We've made difficult decisions to reduce investment in products with smaller revenue potential like Astra Data Store and SolidFire. The results of this focus are visible in our ability to maintain our free cash flow, operating margin, and EPS guidance despite lower revenue. On to the second focus area, reinvigorating our storage business. As we moved rapidly to embrace cloud, we lost some momentum in our Hybrid Cloud business.We are taking decisive action to strengthen our position and performance by better addressing the areas of market growth, delivering more customer value, and realigning our go-to-market activities to better address this opportunity. We were slow to fully embrace the customer desire for lower-cost, capacity-oriented all-flash systems. At the start of Q4, we rectified that situation with the introduction of the AFF C-Series, the most comprehensive, industry-leading portfolio of QLC-based all-flash arrays that addresses a wide range of workloads and price points. These products will help customers manage through a cost sensitive environment while, at the same time, supporting their pursuit of sustainability targets. Initial response has been very positive, and we are already quoting deals for customers.The AFF C-Series will drive AFA revenue and support product gross margin as customers rotate from lower margin hybrid flash to all-flash systems. In addition to expanding our product portfolio, we've introduced a number of innovations to improve the customer experience and bring predictability to their investment process. In Q3, we released BlueXP, a unified control plane that helps decrease resource waste, complexity, and the risk of managing diverse environments. As a part of our sustainability commitment, we're previewing a new dashboard in BlueXP to help customers understand their data center carbon footprint across environments. Early in Q4, we introduced NetApp Advance, a best-in-class portfolio of programs and guarantees, which is already helping us win new customers and drive revenue.Finance, Business, OfficePhoto by Joshua Mayo on UnsplashWe are rebalancing our sales and marketing efforts to better address the significant storage market opportunity, including aligning compensation plans to drive sales of our reinvigorated storage portfolio. We believe that these actions will enable us to drive product revenue growth and regain share in the all-flash array market. Finally, our third area of focus, building a more focused approach to cloud. While we are reinvigorating our storage business, we have no intention of taking our foot off the pedal in Public Cloud. It represents a huge growth opportunity for us with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the business. Additionally, our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated, with a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors, and create customer preference for NetApp.We have sharpened the focus in our CloudOps portfolio and have taken actions that could have future revenue and ARR implications. We believe that our CloudOps services will continue to deliver stable, steady growth over the long term. Our customer success team has made good progress in driving utilization of our CloudOps services, but we need to do more with our cloud storage and data services. Additionally, we recognize that we have not been using our go-to-market resources to their best effect here. In addition to refocusing our sales team on the reinvigorated storage portfolio, we are identifying ways to most effectively align our sales resources to the buying centers and consumption models for all our solutions. Our cloud storage business is predominately consumption-based and largely driven by our hyperscaler partners.These factors, coupled with the current cloud cost-optimization environment have impacted our ability to forecast ARR. However, as we grow the business, the impact from a subset of customers will be mitigated, smoothing its growth and improving predictability. I want to underscore my confidence in this opportunity. The migration of enterprise applications, like SAP and VMware, to the cloud, as well as cloud-native applications, like artificial intelligence, create a massive market in which we can grow. We believe strongly that Public Cloud services can be a multibillion-dollar ARR business for us. However, achieving that target will take longer than we initially planned due to the industry-wide slowdown in cloud spending and our recent performance.In closing, we have seen tangible success from our efforts to manage the elements within our control in a challenging environment. Despite our lowered revenue outlook, we have preserved free cash flow and EPS expectations. In the first three fiscal quarters of this year, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders and reduced share count by 4%. We are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our position for the long-term. We are taking these steps now, so that, as we begin FY24, we are in a new, more focused operating model to attack the opportunity ahead, drive growth, and deliver shareholder value. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to give my thanks to the NetApp team for their operational discipline and rapid response to set us up for better results.I have seen first-hand how hard they are working to navigate the challenging environment and I really appreciate their efforts.Mike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to reiterate the key themes for today's discussion that George highlighted. Number one, despite the temporary headwinds to revenue, our disciplined operational management yielded op margin and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Number two, the macro backdrop and demand environment continue to be major headwinds. The weakening IT spending environment was most pronounced in our large enterprise and U.S. technology and service provider customers and materially impacted our all-flash revenue in Q3, while significant cloud optimization across all three major hyperscalers continued to weigh heavily on ARR growth.Although the U.S. dollar weakened slightly during Q3, FX continues to be a material headwind to our financial results on a year-over-year basis. Number three, as we navigate through this fluid demand environment, we remain laser focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. Towards this end, we took swift action in Q3 to control costs through increased program spending scrutiny and a hiring freeze. And at the start of Q4, we implemented a reduction in force of approximately 8%. In addition to adjusting our own cost structure, we also introduced C-Series, a portfolio of QLC capacity-flash arrays to support cost sensitive datacenter customers, and we continued to work with our cloud customers to help optimize their spending.And number four, as a result of our disciplined cost management, we are reiterating our full-year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50. We are also confident in our free cash flow target of $1.1 billion, adjusting for the restructuring and one-time cash tax payment in Q4. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal 23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Now to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Q3 billings were $1.57 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 340 basis-point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been down 7% and 2% year-over-year, respectively.Even with the challenging Q3, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall revenue growth profile of NetApp. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.38 billion was down 9% year-over-year. Product revenue of $682 million decreased 19% year-over-year, as customers took a decidedly cautious approach to capital spending. Total Q3 recurring support revenue of $616 million increased 5% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q3 at $605 million, up 29% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $150 million, up 36% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. As highlighted by our three major hyperscaler partners, customers continue to optimize their cloud spend as organizations are exercising caution, given the macroeconomic uncertainty.While the timing of the recovery remains unclear, we are confident the secular trends of AI, machine learning, IoT and high-performance computing, along with the migration of enterprise apps like VMware &amp; SAP, will drive long-term growth in cloud storage consumption. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $766 million was up 10% year-over-year, constituting 50% of total revenue. We ended Q3 with $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q3 marks the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67% in Q3, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 67% in Q3. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 46.5%, including a 2-point year-over-year headwind from FX.As noted, our large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers have continued to reduce CapEx spend as they right-size their spending envelops. These customers are the most forward leaning technology adopters and the biggest consumers of all-flash systems in the economy, and their pause in CapEx spending has had a material impact on our total revenue, all-flash mix and product margins. And while the supply chain component premiums and NAND pricing notably improved in Q3, we had to work through higher-cost inventory during the quarter. We expect the improving supply chain and NAND pricing to be a tailwind to product margin in Q4 and fiscal 24. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%.Public Cloud gross margin of 69% was accretive to the corporate average for the ninth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. While revenue came in at the low-end of guidance, Q3 highlighted our operational discipline and cost controls, with operating margin of 24%, including 2-points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.37 came in above the high-end of guidance and included $0.14 of year-over-year FX headwind. Cash flow from operations was $377 million and free cash flow was $319 million. Inventory turns increased to 12 in Q3, up from 9 in Q2, as supply chain challenges eased in the quarter, enabling us to take down inventory by nearly $70 million sequentially.During Q3, we repurchased $200 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $308 million to shareholders, representing 97% of free cash flow. Share count of 219 million was down 4% year-over-year. We closed Q3 with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, up $108 million sequentially. Now to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen continued softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. We now expect fiscal '23 revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year, which includes 3 to 4 percentage points of FX headwind. In fiscal 23, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins.While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time, particularly when you factor in our new C-Series portfolio, which will largely displace lower margin hybrid spinning disk systems in our product mix. Given our disciplined cost controls, we are raising our fiscal 23 operating margin guidance. We now expect op margin to range between 23% and 24%, which includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind. Last quarter, we committed to protecting both, EPS and free cash flow during this uncertain macro environment. Today, we are reiterating our full-year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50, which includes $0.54 of currency impacts. We also continue to expect to generate $1.1 billion in free cash flow, excluding one-time items.From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal '23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Now on to Q4 guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.475 billion and $1.625 billion which, at the midpoint, implies an 8% decrease year-over-year, or a 6% decrease in constant currency. In this macro environment, we expect customers to continue to optimize their cloud spend at our three major hyperscaler partners. As a result, we expect cloud revenue and ARR to be approximately flat sequentially in Q4. Please note, as we head into fiscal 24, we plan to anchor our cloud segment guidance on revenue dollars, instead of ARR. To be clear, we will continue to disclose cloud ARR as a key metric as we go through the year.We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67%. As we head into Q4, we are forecasting a material reduction in component premiums, decreasing NAND costs, and engineering product efficiencies. As such, we are confident that product margins will rise in Q4. These trends also position us nicely heading into fiscal 24 to drive leverage through our business model, particularly as customers begin to reengage on all-flash capacity buildouts and customers mix shift away from hybrid spinning disk systems to new QLC all-flash solutions. While the exact timing is unclear, large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers are the largest consumers of data and storage in the global economy and our all-flash ONTAP systems are structurally linked to their data growth cross cycle.In Q4, we expect operating margin to range between 23% and 24%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be approximately 21%. We are forecasting earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.30 and $1.40 per share. Assumed in our Q4 guidance is net interest income of $7.5 million and a share count of approximately 218 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such an uncertain economic environment. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&amp;A.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on Occidental Petroleum's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:45% = US$13b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.45 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 45% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Occidental Petroleum has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 31% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Despite this, Occidental Petroleum's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 13% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is OXY fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Occidental Petroleum Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Occidental Petroleum's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 3.1% (implying that the company keeps97% of its income) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth and this should be reflected in its growth number, but that's not the case.In addition, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 21% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 19%) over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Occidental Petroleum certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. In addition, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that the company's earnings are expected to continue to shrink.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Boston Scientific, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.071 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$32b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Boston Scientific has an ROCE of 7.1%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 10.0%. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Boston Scientific compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Boston Scientific.How Are Returns Trending?Unfortunately, the trend isn't great with ROCE falling from 12% five years ago, while capital employed has grown 114%. However, some of the increase in capital employed could be attributed to the recent capital raising that's been completed prior to their latest reporting period, so keep that in mind when looking at the ROCE decrease. The funds raised likely haven't been put to work yet so it's worth watching what happens in the future with Boston Scientific's earnings and if they change as a result from the capital raise.Story continuesOn a related note, Boston Scientific has decreased its current liabilities to 12% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.In Conclusion...In summary, Boston Scientific is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has gained an impressive 76% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Boston Scientific does come with some risks though, we found 4 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those can't be ignored...For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.  View our latest analysis for Capital One Financial  The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Capital One FinancialOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Neal Blinde, for US$921k worth of shares, at about US$115 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$110. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). In addition, Mr Blinde still retained a considerable portion of his total holdings. Notably Neal Blinde was also the biggest buyer, having purchased US$3.7k worth of shares.In total, Capital One Financial insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Capital One Financial Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Capital One Financial shares. In total, insider Neal Blinde sold US$921k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Capital One Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Capital One Financial insiders own 1.2% of the company, currently worth about US$507m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Capital One Financial Insiders?An insider sold Capital One Financial shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. When we did our research, we found  4 warning signs for Capital One Financial  (1 can't be ignored!) that we believe deserve your full attention.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The “Oracle of Omaha” railed against deficits and those politicians that slam stock buybacks for the sake of doing so. Buffett played up the need for people to save money and invest for the long-term, two classic Buffett approaches to life. And also in classic Buffett form, the billionaire investor added a dose of life wisdom: “Find a very smart high-grade partner – preferably slightly older than you – and then listen very carefully to what he says,” Buffett said, in a shout to long-time friend and business partner Charlie Munger. What Buffett didn’t mention: (1) Succession; (2) Views on the current stock market’s levels or valuations; (3) FTX’s blowup.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Warren Buffett's annual shareholder letter is out. Here are three top takeaways from the Yahoo Finance team. First up, a call to action to all humans start saving money-- Buffett says this. It is those dedicated savers that are forefront in my mind as I write this letter.He adds, Charlie and I are not stock pickers. We are business pickers, telling people to save money. And maybe they're listening. The US savings rate is now at a one year high, at about 4.7%. I think Buffett wants to see it even higher.Takeaway number two, investing school is in session again-- no surprise here in the Warren Buffett annual shareholder letter, Buffett noting this, saying, quote, ""the lesson for investors, the weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom over time. It takes just a few winners to work wonders."" And yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s, as well, Warren Buffett 92 years old, his longtime partner Charlie Munger 99 years old; Warren Buffett saying, if you want to be a successful investor, invest for the long term-- no surprise. That's typical Warren Buffett being Warren Buffett.Takeaway number three here, a message or messages to all politicians here, Warren Buffett taking some jabs at folks in DC, noting this. Berkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation. But this attribute is far from perfect. Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences-- interesting take there from Buffett.Buffett also says-- really tries to, I think, champion stock repurchases, saying repurchases, those that tell people that repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country are particularly beneficial to CEOs, you're listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue-- so Warren Buffett taking some swings at politicians. What we did not hear in this letter, no succession plan. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger will be at that May 5th to May 6th annual shareholder meeting in Omaha-- Brian Sozzi, out.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds. Investors are regaining confidence in the stock market as the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 4.92% year-to-date return. Moreover, global inflation is likely to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023,  as reported by International Monetary Fund in January. The report also mentioned that 84% of countries are expected to experience lower headline inflation this year as compared to 2022. Considering this positive outlook of the market, investors show an inclination toward stocks that would help them achieve stable regular income. In this regard, dividend-focused companies with strong dividend growth track records remain popular among investors.Dividend growers have historically outperformed their peers, becoming top choices for investors. According to a report by Merrill Edge, an American financial services company, dividend stocks can help to alleviate portfolio losses when stock prices fall. The report further highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — stocks that have raised their dividend for 25 years or more — delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market. In addition to this, dividend stocks reflected a volatility of 13.22%, in contrast with a 14.22% volatility for the S&amp;P 500.Analysts expect that dividend stocks will be able to maintain their performance in 2023 as well. According to UBS, dividends per share in the S&amp;P 500 will grow by 1% this year, even with a potential 11% decline in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The financial services company also estimated that dividends per share could grow by 20% in the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids a recession.Story continuesMcDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some of the most important companies that have raised their dividends for a significant period of time. Moreover, these companies have strong cash flow generation that promises further dividend growth. In view of these arguments, we will discuss the dividend aristocrats that are popular among hedge funds.S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund PopularityTechnology share chartOur Methodology:Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have increased their dividends consistently over the past 25 consecutive years. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 15 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022.

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business.

With 400 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company, based in Illinois.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11.

NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Lowe's Companies, Inc.

(NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some other popular dividend stocks favored by investors.As of the close of Q4 2022, 70 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), worth over $4.4 billion collectively.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:15 Best Oil Stocks to Buy10 Small Cap SaaS Stocks Hedge Funds are Piling Into13 Most Profitable Food StocksDisclosure.

He noted the dividend had grown to $704 million by last year, up from $75 million the first year, writing, “Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All [Vice Chairman Charlie Munger] and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow.”The legendary investor also defended stock buybacks. Last year, the U.S. government imposed a 1% tax on them—a late addition to the Inflation Reduction Act—and Biden has signaled support for raising it.“When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive),” he wrote.His firm has been among the largest U.S. repurchasers in recent years, buying back almost $8 billion of its own shares in 2022, $27 billion in 2021, and about $25 billion in 2020.“There are many Berkshire centimillionaires and, yes, billionaires who have never studied our financial figures,” he wrote. “They simply know that Charlie and I—along with our families and close friends—continue to have very significant investments in Berkshire, and they trust us to treat their money as we do our own.”Buffett also took aim at the financial trickery that managers often perform to beat analysts’ expectations.“Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily be manipulated by managers who wish to do so,” he warned. “Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticated by CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well.”Story continuesHe called the activity “disgusting,” adding, “It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire to deceive is required. ‘Bold imaginative accounting,’ as a CEO once described his deception to me, has become one of the shames of capitalism.”Berkshire Hathaway has ranked among the most most-admired companies in the U.S. for decades. Running such a firm appears to be correlated with the longevity of CEOs, and Buffett has been in that role for more than half a century.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash?

We owe the country no less: America’s dynamism has made a huge contribution to whatever success Berkshire has achieved — a contribution Berkshire will always need. We count on the American Tailwind and, though it has been becalmed from time to time, its propelling force has always returned.""Elsewhere in his letter, Buffett criticized those critical of share buybacks, slammed Wall Street's obsession with earnings ""beats,"" and outlined how the spirit of Berkshire will live on after he and vice chairman Charlie Munger are gone.Here are seven top takeaways from Buffett's annual letter.'At Berkshire, there will be no finish line.'At Berkshire Hathaway's 2021 annual meeting, Buffett told shareholders what many had long suspected — Greg Abel, currently CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, will succeed Buffett as CEO.Though Buffett and Munger, who turned 99 on Jan. 1, continue to show the spirit and enthusiasm of men much younger than them, life for Berkshire Hathaway after Warren and Charlie remains a key focus for investors.In his latest annual letter, Buffett offered shareholders a brief history of Berkshire's corporate story, which began with the ill-fated purchase of textile manufacturer Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 and continues today with a collection of businesses and investments that earned $30.8 billion in operating profits in 2022.""Berkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified businesses,"" Buffett wrote. Buffett noted that in 2021, there were 128 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that earned more than $3 billion in profits — and Berkshire was the largest shareholder in 8 of these businesses: American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Chevron (CVX), Coca-Cola (KO), HP Inc. (HPQ), Moody’s (MCO), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Paramount Global (PARA).Story continuesA cutout photo of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett welcomes investors and guests as they shop for deals during the first in-person annual meeting since 2019 of Berkshire Hathaway Inc in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. April 29, 2022. REUTERS/Scott MorganAdding in Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiaries BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Buffett wrote: ""All told, our 10 controlled and non-controlled behemoths leave Berkshire more broadly aligned with the country's economic future than is the case at any other U.S. company.""""As for the future, Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and U.S. Treasury bills along with a wide array of businesses,"" Buffett wrote. ""We will also avoid behavior that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses. Our CEO will always be the Chief Risk Officer – a task it is irresponsible to delegate. Additionally, our future CEOs will have a significant part of their net worth in Berkshire shares, bought with their own money. And yes, our shareholders will continue to save and prosper by retaining earnings.""At Berkshire, there will be no finish line.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.On buybacks, 'the math isn't complicated'In 2022, Berkshire Hathaway repurchased 1.2% of its outstanding shares, a move Buffett told shareholders ""directly increased your interest in our unique collection of businesses.""Buffett also noted buybacks at AmEx and Apple (AAPL) — Berkshire's largest position at the end of last year — increased the company's ownership in each firm.""The math isn’t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up,"" Buffett wrote. ""Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices.""In recent months, as ever, share repurchases have remained a hot button political issue, with a new 1% tax on share buybacks taking effect in January and President Joe Biden floating a 4% tax on this activity in his State of the Union address earlier this year.Actions and criticisms for which Buffett had no kind words.""When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive),"" Buffett wrote.President Joe Biden delivers the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol, Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2023, in Washington, as Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Calif., listen. Jacquelyn Martin/Pool via REUTERSDividends and Berkshire's 'secret sauce'Investors have pored over Buffett's writings for decades looking for ways to imitate his investment process and generate the kinds of returns Berkshire shareholders have enjoyed for three generations.Writing about Berkshire's ""secret sauce"" in this year's letter, Buffett pointed to a simple variable: time.Citing Berkshire's longstanding investments in Coca-Cola and American Express, Buffett noted that positions in both companies completed nearly 30 years ago earned Berkshire dividends in 2022 worth more than $1 billion.""These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular,"" he wrote. ""But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago.""Berkshire's initial stake in both companies cost the company $1.3 billion.""The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom,"" Buffett wrote. ""Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.'Bold imaginative accounting' as 'one of the shames of capitalism'For Wall Street analysts and the business media alike, quarterly earnings are the most calendar markers for following any company.But these four-times-per-year looks at a business — and the snap judgements investors can often make as a result — do not offer the kind of long-term perspective Buffett sees forming the framework of successful investing.And moreover, the current focus on whether a company's results beat expectations or not turn into a game that is just that — a game.In 2022, Berkshire Hathaway reported operating earnings of $30.8 billion. Its GAAP earnings, which are required to take into account fluctuations in the value of its stock portfolio, showed Berkshire lost $22.8 billion last year.Buffett called these GAAP losses ""100% misleading,"" noting that in future years he expects the results will be positive though the message stays the same: ""Their quarter-by-quarter gyrations, regularly and mindlessly headlined by media, totally misinform investors.""Even the ""operating earnings"" Buffett prefers to look at, however, fall short of offering investors the kind of clean view of a company's results investors must make for themselves.""Finally, an important warning: Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily be manipulated by managers who wish to do so,"" Buffett wrote. ""Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticated by CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well. Beating 'expectations' is heralded as a managerial triumph.""That activity is disgusting. It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire to deceive is required. 'Bold imaginative accounting,' as a CEO once described his deception to me, has become one of the shames of capitalism.""Taxes, the deficit, and 'consequences'In this year's annual letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted the taxes paid by Berkshire to the U.S. government over the years — and the taxes Berkshire expects to pay in the future.From 2012-2021, Buffett said Berkshire paid some $32 billion in taxes, which he noted is almost exactly 0.1% of all tax payments taken in by the Treasury Department over that time.""At Berkshire we hope and expect to pay much more in taxes during the next decade,"" Buffett wrote. ""We owe the country no less: America’s dynamism has made a huge contribution to whatever success Berkshire has achieved — a contribution Berkshire will always need.""Buffett also noted over that period, the U.S. government took in about $32 trillion in tax receipts while spending closer to $44 trillion.And though Buffett wrote he and Munger ""plead ignorance"" on the matter of the country's fiscal imbalances, Buffett warned: ""Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences.""Munger's wisdomThough they've been business partners for over 40 years, Buffett remains a fan of Charlie Munger's witticisms like so many of the rest of us.In this year's annual letter, Buffett used a full page to pull out Munger one-liners from a recent podcast:""All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I'll never go there. And a related thought: Early on, write your desired obituary — and then behave accordingly.""""You can learn a lot from dead people. Read of the deceased you admire and detest.""""There is no such thing as a 100% sure thing when investing.""Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett (left) and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are seen at the annual Berkshire shareholder shopping day in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., May 3, 2019. REUTERS/Scott MorganAlways sellingAs always, Buffett took the final section of this year's letter to both invite shareholders to Omaha, Nebraska, for the annual shareholder meeting — and to shamelessly plug some of Berkshire's portfolio companies that spend the weekend hawking wares to shareholders eager to spend their money where they've invested it.""Charlie and I are shameless,"" Buffett wrote. ""Last year, at our first shareholder get-together in three years, we greeted you with our usual commercial hustle.""Nearly 7,000 transactions were completed at the See's Candies booth at the Berkshire annual meeting last year, good for a pace of 10 sales per minute.Buffett wrote See's is ""selling products that haven’t been materially altered in 101 years.

109,66c31746-12eb-3a9e-98cf-ef7d018e8c14,VMC,2023-02-26,Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) Will Pay A US$0.43 Dividend In Four Days,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vulcan-materials-company-nyse-vmc-122422718.html,1677414262,STORY,['VMC'],"[Readers hoping to buy Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. In other words, investors can purchase Vulcan Materials' shares before the 3rd of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 20th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.43 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.60 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Vulcan Materials has a trailing yield of approximately 0.9% on its current stock price of $183.64. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Vulcan Materials can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Vulcan Materials paying out a modest 36% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 40% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That explains why we're not overly excited about Vulcan Materials's flat earnings over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Vulcan Materials has delivered 45% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Vulcan Materials? Earnings per share have been flat, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend gets cut. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.In light of that, while Vulcan Materials has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Vulcan Materials and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the energy sector, its previous performance, and outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Invest In. The energy sector in the US remained stable in 2022 due to high prices and tight supplies. The sector ended the year with record gains, soaring 58% as of December 30, compared with a roughly 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500. According to Dow Jones Market Data, this was the first time ever for the energy sector to emerge as a solo winner of the S&amp;P 500 calendar year. Moreover, it was the benchmark’s only sector that did not decline during the year.One of the main factors that contributed to the solid performance of the energy sector last year was the rising oil and gas prices. Analysts are expecting the trend to continue this year as well. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for OANDA in New York, talked to Fox Business about the energy industry’s outlook for 2023. He asserted that many geo-political tensions could still keep the oil and gas prices elevated this year. He further mentioned that though fluctuating market conditions could not reveal a clear picture, the energy sector is still in a good shape amid a slow global economy.The outperformance of the energy industry is driving investors toward the sector as energy companies have steadily raised their dividends over the last 12 months, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report also mentioned that these payouts would still hold an effect even if the economy enters a recession. In addition to this, investors also tend to focus on companies that have strong free cash flow generation. According to a report by Fidelity, free cash flow yields in the energy industry were at their all-time high relative to the broader market at the end of 2022. Moreover, many energy companies have significantly reduced their debts over the past two years and are now returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), NextEra Energy, Inc.

And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.Story continuesNick Zarcone: Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and full year 2022, and then Rick will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2023 outlook before I come back with a few closing remarks. This month, we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of our company's founding in February 1998. What started with a few salvage facilities in the U.S. has grown to a Fortune 300 business with operations in 28 countries and over 45,000 employees, providing a wide array of aftermarket and recycled parts used to repair, maintain and accessorize vehicles. Our operations are leaders in their respective markets and are well positioned to continue their success in the future.Getting to this point has been the result of the dedication of our past and present teams. And I want to express my sincere appreciation for all of these efforts. I am excited to see what this team can deliver in the future, as the LKQ team is never satisfied, never rests on its laurels and has always pushing to be the best. When LKQ was founded, ESG was not the hot topic that it is today. But ESG has always been a vital part of our strategy. Through our recycling operations, we are enabling the circular economy in doing our part to reduce waste. I am proud of our contributions to date and I can assure you that our emphasis on sustainability will continue to be an integral part of our mission. Our success in ESG is being recognized by external parties.On December 05, 2022, MSCI upgraded LKQ to their highest ESG rating of AAA, placing LKQ in the top 5% of all companies that they rate globally. And on January 31 of this year, LKQ was included in Sustainalytics' 2023 Top-Rated ESG Companies list. The fourth quarter of 2022 closed a year where the resilience of our businesses shine through a myriad of uncontrollable headwinds, ranging from economic softness, inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, energy cost spikes and a war in Europe. From an operating perspective, the fourth quarter was a very strong set of results, and I could not be more proud of our team. The continuation of exceptional organic revenue growth and strong margins in our North American wholesale segment, when combined with solid organic revenue growth and the highest fourth quarter EBITDA margins in the history of our European segment, offset the impact of the continued headwinds experienced in our Specialty and Self Service segments.The January revenue trends are similar to the levels generated in the fourth quarter. While the operations were collectively right on target with the guidance that we provided back in October, the annual tax provision was higher than anticipated, which drove a full year catch up in the fourth quarter and resulted in quarterly EPS at the low end of the guidance range. Rick will provide more detail on the tax provision in a few minutes. Now on to the strong quarterly results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $3 billion, a decrease of 5.8% as compared to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by FX translation and the divestiture of PGW. Parts and services organic revenue increased 4.5% on a reported basis and 5.9% on a per day basis.The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures decreased revenue by 3.1% and foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by 6.1%, for a total parts and services revenue decrease of 4.8%. Other revenue fell 20.1%, primarily due to weaker commodity prices relative to the same period in 2021. Net income in the fourth quarter was $193 million as compared to $235 million for the same period in 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.72 as compared to $0.81 for the same period last year, a decrease of 11%. During the quarter, we had an unfavorable $0.15 year-over-year impact related to the higher-than-anticipated tax rates. The tax rate was also higher than anticipated during our third quarter call, which generated an unfavorable $0.05 effect on adjusted diluted EPS relative to our guidance.On an adjusted basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $209 million as compared to $254 million for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 17.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.78 as compared to $0.87 for the same period of last year, a decrease of 10.3%. Net income for the full year of 2022 was $1.14 billion as compared to $1.09 billion for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2022 was $4.11 as compared to $3.66 for the same period of 2021, an increase of 12.3%. Please note that 2022 results include the gain on sale of PGW. On an adjusted basis, net income for the full year of 2022 was $1.1 billion. That's compared to $1.2 billion for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 9.4%.Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year was $3.85 as compared to $3.96 for the same period of last year, a decrease of 2.8%. Adjusted earnings exclude the gain of the PGW sale but include the impact of the higher tax rate. Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 12, organic revenue for parts and services in the fourth quarter for our North American segment increased 10.3% on a reported basis and 12% on a per day basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to perform well in North America especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision liability related auto claims were down (ph) year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Looking back at our performance through the financial crisis, from 2008 to 2010, our North American business grew organically at an average of 7.5%, which drove the alternative part usage rate, or APU rate, above its historical annual growth rates.As we enter 2023 and face the reality of a global recession, our alternative parts offerings clearly become more attractive during these challenging economic periods. We are also encouraged by the trend in parts per repair, which reached an all-time high in 2022. Important to note is that our sweet spot has expanded and today stands at model years four to 15 years of age. All these items combined positions North America well for continued organic growth in 2023. The upward trend in our aftermarket sales volumes and the ongoing improvement in our fill rates continued in the fourth quarter with fill rates reaching their highest percentage levels in 2022, and today stands at close to the pre-pandemic level of 93%. Importantly, as the supply chain recovered and fill rates increased, the entire industry realized a 220-basis point improvement in the aftermarket percentage of APU, taking share back from the OEs as we progress throughout the year.The supply chain has stabilized and our inventory is generally where we want it to be. The main issue we are confronting today are continued delays at some of the railheads due to congestion. As many of you know, on December 7 of last year, State Farm announced that they are rolling out expanded non-OEM collision repair parts to use in most of the United States. We are excited the State Farm is embracing the aftermarket value proposition that the industry offers, which will ultimately benefit the end consumer. We continue to actually analyze this opportunity and we are well positioned to compete for our fair share of this opportunity and have built our inventory appropriately to do so. Our salvage inventory is also healthy and we saw some relief on our cost per vehicle during the quarter.The salvage business had solid organic growth, largely driven by price, but as we entered December, we witnessed an upward trend in our salvage volumes. Total loss rates increased a bit in the fourth quarter, which were largely seasonal. And as you can see, it had no impact on our organic growth. These slightly higher loss rates played a role in our ability to source the right level of inventory at auction at attractive prices. As we have stated before, fluctuations in loss rates are largely net neutral events for LKQ. Moving on to our European segment. Europe organic revenue growth of parts and services in the quarter increased 4.6% on a reported basis and 5.8% on a per day basis, which represents the best fourth quarter per day organic revenue growth since 2016.I'd also like to highlight that Europe's segment EBITDA margin was the highest fourth quarter level since entering the European market in 2011. On a full year basis, Europe's performance is another year of double-digit segment EBITDA margins, which is consistent with our 1 LKQ Europe initiative and strategy. Rick will cover more margin details in his prepared remarks. Throughout the quarter, our European team was laser-focused on the cost structure, including rationalizing headcount to create a more nimble and agile team and focusing our team on a narrow and actionable list of key projects. These projects represent the highest return opportunities that the team can execute in the near term, further cementing the long-term resiliency and market leadership of our European segment.On February 1, LKQ Europe announced that it expanded its European salvage network with the acquisition of Dutch-based Rhenoy Group. Founded in 1991, Rhenoy is a leading supplier of remanufactured engines and recycled OEM car parts. Rhenoy operates a salvage dismantling facility in the Netherlands and remanufacturing plants in both the Netherlands and Poland. As you know, the roots of our company lie in the dismantling of salvage vehicles to recycle OEM parts. As part of our European strategic plan, we intend to capitalize on that history and knowledge, coupled with our remanufacturing capabilities, to grow our salvage network across our European footprint. And with this tuck-in acquisition, we take one small incremental step towards that objective.I want to congratulate our STAHLGRUBER team on their 100th anniversary and commend them for building a resilient and market-leading business that continues to demonstrate an ability to adapt to the ever-changing independent aftermarket. A century since founding brothers Otto and Willy Gruber started the business. Today, the STAHLGRUBER business continues its history of embracing change, which positions them well to capture further opportunity as the car park shifts towards EVs and other forms of mobility. We can't wait to see the next -- what the next 100 years brings for STAHLGRUBER. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the fourth quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 10.6%. Throughout 2022, Specialty was up against tough 2021 comparisons in the midst of decreased demand for certain key RV parts and a slower-than-expected recovery in U.S. light vehicle sales.Looking at the Specialty segment on a multi-year basis, since 2019, Specialty has generated approximately a 4% compound annual growth rate for organic revenue, outperforming the industry growth of SEMA and RV-related products. A few Specialty operational highlights would include that Specialty continued to realize the full benefits of the SeaWide synergies, which exceeded our expectations in dollars and operational execution. And Specialty won O'Reilly's 2022 (ph) Supply Line award for the third year in a row. Now onto our Self Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self Service segment increased 4.8% in the fourth quarter. Self Service was again challenged by commodity pricing as seen in the material decline of other revenue which impacted our expectations for the quarter.On the corporate development front, the fourth quarter was fairly quiet. While we did not complete any material transactions during the quarter, our corporate development team is actively assessing various opportunities that exist across our operating segments. As the global economies continue to soften, that may lead to multiple compression and we are well positioned to execute on synergistic acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. Outside of Q4 corporate development efforts, I am pleased to announce that this past January, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with Korea Zinc Company Limited, a world-class general non-ferrous metal smelting company. Under the memorandum of understanding, we will work towards a potential large scale joint venture related to the recycling of lithium-ion EV batteries in the United States.This is again evidence that we will continue to strategically position the company to adapt to and seize the longer-term opportunities that exist in the ever-changing car park. Turning to ESG. During the fourth quarter, we continued to build out our ESG program by focusing on our people efforts and various social initiatives. Here are a few worth noting. Every colleague employed by LKQ ELIT Ukraine for at least six months received a one-time hardship payment to support pain for energy and the general increase in the cost of living owing to the Russian invasion. Our U.K. and German operations also implemented one-time hardship payments to support our employees in those markets given the state of the overall European economy. We initiated a voluntary daily pay benefit in the United States that allows our employees to access a portion of their earned pay on demand.Auto, Industry, TechnologyPhoto by Obi - @pixel7propix on UnsplashThe company implemented this benefit with the financial wellness of our people in mind. And we launched our first employee inclusion group, the LKQ Veterans Network, a program that embraces our proud community of employee veterans and veteran allies who support and encourage each other to share experiences, veteran recruitment, career development, outward engagement, professional growth and retention. In 2022, our North American salvage operations continued our leadership as the largest recycler of vehicles by processing over 753,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of approximately 3.6 million gallons of fuel, 2.2 million gallons of waste oil, 2 million tires, 700,000 batteries and approximately 955,000 tons of scrap metal.The end result of these efforts resulted in nearly 13 million recycled and repurposed parts being sold into the collision and mechanical repair shop industry that otherwise would have ended up in landfills. Let's turn to the inflationary environment, again a key item of interest for most listeners on this call. As I discussed this time last year, we expected inflation to be a headwind throughout 2022 and that expectation became a harsh reality all year across each of our segments. Fortunately, we are beginning to see some moderation with inflation in the U.S., and recently we witnessed the rate of inflation drop for the last three months in a row across the Eurozone. Eurozone inflation stood at approximately 8.5% in January, down from October, where it was almost 11%.Despite this drop, many of our key operating markets continue to face high inflation rates with certain countries running in the high-single to low-double digits. In the U.S., the labor markets continue to be strained and unpredictable in the midst of higher interest rates and mounting fears of a recession. Daily we read about high profile layoffs, yet new claims for unemployment benefits remain at a historic low. As of late, wage inflation is beginning to slow and certain areas of our business are seeing reductions in turnover. But these reductions are not material and we are far from out of the woods, but it is validation that our retention and employee engagement programs are gaining traction. Our engagement efforts aren't simply an HR mandate.They are programs that stretch across all levels of the organization and are a key component of our culture. Our global engagement score of 74 is significantly above the average for companies of our size. Studies have shown that employees who are engaged are 14% more productive and that companies with engaged employees are 23% more profitable than those with disengaged employees. So, from a business perspective, positive employee engagement is critical, but importantly, it's the right thing to do for our most important asset, our people. Lastly, before I turn the discussion over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2023, I am pleased to announce that on February 21, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share of common stock payable on March 30, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 16, 2023.Rick Galloway: Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I go into details of the fourth quarter, I'd like to reflect on what LKQ accomplished in the last year. We entered 2022 with a strong position based on the success of our operational excellence initiatives and solid balance sheet after reporting the highest profitability in the company's history in 2021. We expected there to be headwinds in 2022 from the areas Nick mentioned. As you can see on the bridge, on Slide 5, these headwinds did set us back, but the LKQ team drove operational improvements to produce roughly $0.40 of operating increases relative to 2021. We also sustained the positive momentum around cash flow generation, with free cash flow of just over $1 billion in 2022, and healthy conversion ratio of 60% of EBITDA.Our work on free cash flow in recent years supported some noteworthy accomplishments in the last year: LKQ achieved investment-grade ratings from all three major rating agencies; returned $284 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends and increased the quarterly amount by 10% in October; repurchased roughly 20 million shares of LKQ stock for just over $1 billion, which combined with the carryover benefit from 2021 purchases added $0.23 of EPS compared to 2021; and all while maintaining a net leverage ratio at less than 1.5 times EBITDA. In early January 2023, we replaced our prior credit facility, which included a $3.15 billion revolver, with a new unsecured facility, including a $500 million term loan and $2.0 billion revolver. Our confidence in the balance sheet and ability to generate robust cash flow factored into the decision to reduce the size of the facility.We were pleased to complete this new facility ahead of the prior facility becoming current and lock-in funding over the next five years at a competitive rate structure. Generating these successful outcomes despite challenging conditions is a credit to the entire LKQ team and I want to thank all of them for their contributions. Now turning to the fourth quarter results, starting with segment performance. Going to Slide 14, Wholesale North America continued its strong performance, posting a record fourth quarter segment EBITDA margin of 18.5%, a 330 basis point improvement over last year. We saw gross margin improvement of 150 basis points, driven by favorable mix and the sale of the lower margin PGW business as well as pricing and productivity initiatives.Overhead expenses were favorable by 180 basis points, primarily related to non-recurring expenses incurred in 2021. Strong organic revenue growth aided by the rebound and aftermarket parts volume offset inflationary cost increases and benefited operating leverage. As mentioned in prior quarters, we believe there will likely be some moderation in segment EBITDA margin in upcoming quarters as the benefits of the 2022 price increases fall away with the resultant EBITDA margin expected to be in the high 17%-s, low 18% range for 2023. Europe also delivered its highest-ever fourth quarter margin at 10.0%, up 110 basis points from the prior year period. As seen on Slide 15, gross margin improved by 10 basis points as we worked to offset inflation with pricing and procurement initiatives.Overhead expenses decreased by 70 basis points with an emphasis on cost structure and improved leverage due to the 5.8% per day organic revenue growth. Inflation related to personnel, freight and fuel costs remains a critical concern across the European markets. The team is actively addressing the pressures through productivity initiatives. Europe produced a segment EBITDA margin 10.2% for the full year, the second consecutive year of double-digit margins. I want to commend the Europe team for achieving this result despite the onset of the war on the Ukraine and significant macroeconomic headwinds. And we are optimistic about incremental margin expansion of 20 basis points to 30 basis points in 2023. Moving to Slide 16. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 6.2% declined 130 basis points compared to the prior year, coming from a decrease in overhead expense leverage, driven by an organic revenue decline of 9.1% per day as they anniversary a tough comp from the prior year when the business delivered a 6% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter on top of the 17% growth in Q4 2020.Inflationary pressures also pushed overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue higher, including personnel, freight and fuel expenses. The overhead expense increase were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and benefits from operating expense synergies, largely generated from the SeaWide acquisition. As you can see on Slide 17, Self Service profitability improved sequentially from the low point in Q3, but remained on the low end of our historical range of 5.2% for the fourth quarter and below our expectations. Metals prices continued to have a negative effect on results with unfavorable lag effect and reduced operating leverage caused by the lower metals revenue dollars. When we broke out Self Service as a separate segment in Q1 2022, we highlighted that this business would have cycles, mostly driven by commodity price volatility.We are working through a down cycle now and the team is focused on buying the right quantity of cars at the best price to drive margin dollars higher. With the uncontrollable commodity dynamic in this business, we will emphasize generating margin dollars and free cash flow rather than targeting a specific margin percentage. Now on to the consolidated results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.72 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.78, which was a $0.09 reduction relative to Q4 last year. As previously mentioned, our operational performance showed year-over-year improvement and was in line with our expectations. However, this solid operational performance was more than offset by unfavorable year-over-year effects of $0.04 from volatility in metals prices and $0.03 from the foreign currency exchange effects caused by the stronger dollar.Additionally, we had a negative effect of $0.03 from higher interest rates as benchmark rates were markedly higher in Q4 2022. As Nick mentioned, taxes were the most significant unfavorable variance for the quarter, reflecting a $0.15 year-over-year impact and a $0.05 negative variance relative to the guidance provided back in October. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we recognized almost $0.10 in tax provision benefits from discrete items and the reduction in our full year effective rate. We experienced the opposite effect in Q4 2022, as we recorded a negative provision effect of approximately $0.05 from increasing our full year effective rate and unfavorable discrete items. The effective rate increase primarily related to this shifts -- to shifts in the geographic distribution of income.We mitigated about $0.07 of the decline with our lower share count, resulting from our share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $11 million in restructuring expenses, the majority of which relate to a new program we kicked off late in the year. We initiated the 2022 global restructuring program and recognition of the ongoing macroeconomic concerns heading into 2023. All of the segments have submitted plans to improve operational efficiencies by streamlining functions, closing underperforming locations and halting non-essential projects. The total cost of the 2022 program are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million to be incurred over the next few years. Projected cost savings of $20 million related to the program are included in our 2023 guidance, and we expect annual run rate benefits of approximately $30 million by 2025.Shifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $166 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.28 billion, the third consecutive year we have exceeded $1 billion. With the supply chain issues abating, we made good progress in rebuilding our inventory levels in Wholesale North America and Europe. As shown on Slide 35, we increased our inventory values in these segments. Though note that the dollar increase doesn't directly equate to a quantity change given the higher input costs. We are comfortable with our current inventory holdings and are pleased with improvements in aftermarket fill rates. We will continue to evaluate our inventory holdings and may increase our balances in 2023, but not to the extent seen in 2022.The supply chain finance program contributed to an increase in days payable outstanding in Europe in 2022. With the signing of the new credit facility, certain restrictions around the program were eliminated and we view further program expansion to be an opportunity in the next few years. For the year, the cash conversion is 60% conversion of the EBITDA to free cash flow, in line with our targeted range of 55% to 60% We finished at the high end of the range in our guidance, partially due to the lower-than-projected capital expenditures. For the year, capital expenditures were 1.7% of revenue, which is below our targeted 2.0% to 2.25% range. We have experienced delays in receiving capital assets, such as trucks, as a result of supply chain delays.As a result, some of our 2022 orders will be delivered in 2023 and reflected in capital expenditures in the 2023 financials. As of December 31, we had total debt of $2.7 billion with a total leverage ratio of 1.5 times EBITDA, which is comfortably inside our target range of below 2 times. Please note that going forward, I will reference total leverage statistics rather than net leverage as the new credit facility changed the metric to total leverage. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 4% for the quarter due to the market rate hikes in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.8 billion in variable rate debt, so 100 basis point rise in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by $18 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for $152 million and paid a quarterly dividend totaling $74 million.I will conclude our thoughts on projected 2023 results as shown on Slide 6 through 8. Our guidance is based on current market conditions and recent trends and assumes that scrap and precious metals prices hold near December prices and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.08 and the pound sterling at $1.22. We expect organic parts and service revenue growth of between 6% and 8%. Please note that we have one fewer selling day in 2023 and have included associated with the expansion of aftermarket parts volume resulting from State Farm writing claims on CAPA certified parts in three product lines: headlights, taillights and bumper covers.We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20, with a midpoint of $4.05. This is an increase of $0.20 or 5% at the midpoint relative to the 2022 actual figure. Looking at Slide 7 in the presentation, you can see how we get from the 2022 actual EPS to our 2023 guidance. Operating performance is expected to generate growth of $0.24 relative to the 2022 results, mostly related to Wholesale North America from volume growth and Europe due to margin improvement. We do expect a continuation of challenging conditions for Specialty from softening demand for RV-related products and Self Service related to commodity prices and input cost inflation. Share count benefits are projected to add $0.10 to the full year 2023 EPS over and above the share count benefit associated with the deployment of our PGW proceeds.Note that there are no share repurchases assumed for 2023 in this figure. This amount reflects the carryover benefit from 2022 purchases. So, we're expecting very solid improvement on the operations side in 2023, which will drive year-over-year growth despite some non-operational challenges. The exchange rate benefit is nominal and is offset by softening in metals prices. The PGW divestiture creates a $0.02 headwind, reflecting the net reduction caused by lost profits, partly offset by the share count benefit generated from the redeployment of proceeds into share repurchases. Interest is projected to be a significant cost increase with our weighted average borrowing rate on variable rate debt having already risen from close to 1% in 2022 to about 4% by year-end.We anticipate an additional $0.13 in interest expense in 2023 on a year-over-year basis due to higher average market rates. We have included an effective tax rate of 26.3% in the 2023 guidance, roughly in line with the final 2022 rate. We expect to deliver approximately $975 million of free cash flow for the year, achieving 55% EBITDA conversion to free cash flow despite a few key headwinds. As seen on Slide 8, we expect to produce incremental cash flows relative to 2022 from operations, including increased profitability and trade working capital improvements to counteract the following uses of cash. First, as mentioned previously, we underspent on capital expenditures in 2022, including equipment delays, and expect to see an increase of approximately $78 million relative to the prior year.Second, the higher interest rates will require increased cash payments for interest expense, which we are currently projected at roughly $50 million. Third and final, we anticipate increased tax payments of $60 million due to profitability increases and the timing of payments. Thanks for your time this morning. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.Nick Zarcone: Thank you, Rick, for that financial overview. In closing, 2022 was another banner year for our company and again validated the strength of our strategy, our business model and, most importantly, our people. Let me restate our key strategic pillars, which continue to be central to our culture and objectives as we've entered the new year. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn gives us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future.With these pillars in place, coupled with our industry-leading teams, we are well positioned to both face the challenges the new year presents and to continue to deliver positive year-over-year operating results for our shareholders. As always, I want to thank the over 45,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our mission forward regardless of the challenges. Time and time again, our teams have shown that these challenges are opportunities for growth, both for themselves and for the overall organization. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.See also 10 High Growth Micro-cap Stocks to Buy and 10 Best Stocks to Buy For the Next 3 Months.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
112,364e1fd8-36bc-3931-89b1-55e6fc09670c,EL,2023-02-26,Estée Lauder Companies' (NYSE:EL) five-year total shareholder returns outpace the underlying earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-nyse-120038973.html,1677412838,STORY,['EL'],"[The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) shareholders have seen the share price descend 10% over the month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 73% in that time. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 19% decline over the last twelve months.Although Estée Lauder Companies has shed US$3.6b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Estée Lauder Companies managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.4% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 12% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 58.07.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Estée Lauder Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Estée Lauder Companies, it has a TSR of 80% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Estée Lauder Companies shareholders are down 19% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 10%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

If you want to see more high growth high margin stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Buy.High margin stocks have higher margins than average by a fair margin.Generally, maintaining substantially higher than average margins in the long term is difficult given competition.If there is a new opportunity given a new market or a new technological development, a company that captures that opportunity might have few competitors and high margins temporarily. When more firms join and there is more competition, however, margins can decline. With more competition, the firm might have to spend more on advertising, its costs could increase, or it might have to lower the price of its products, all of which could lead to narrower margins.While higher than average margins tend to decrease over time given competition, some companies have higher margins than average either for temporary reasons or for more competitive advantage reasons.Some companies have higher margins for temporary reasons.If oil prices rise considerably, for instance, some oil companies are going to have higher margins than companies in some other industries simply because oil prices have risen a lot. The same, of course, is also true. If oil prices decline, those companies could have lower margins.Some companies have higher margins given they have competitive advantages such as strong brands. Because companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have strong brands, they can charge more for their products than companies that make comparable products can. Because they have similar costs and higher price points, companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have higher margins.There are different types of margins such as gross margins, operating margins, and profit margins. Although all are important, profit margins are arguably the most important for many investors as EPS can lead to dividends or share buybacks if a company has excess capital and management decides to return the excess capital back to shareholders.Story continuesWhat is high, average, and low margin differs based on industry, time period, and also what type of margin it is. For the stocks listed in this article, we define companies with profit margins of over 15% as having high margin. The average profit margin can vary from time to time but is generally considered around 10% give or take several percentage points. Some might think 20% is high profit margin but everyone's definition is different.High GrowthHigh growth companies have different definitions for different people. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.The expected growth rate of a company can change depending on where the economy is in the economic cycle.In terms of where the economy is in the current economic cycle, it is uncertain. Unemployment is low and GDP is growing but the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates considerably and will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, the economy could slow considerably or even enter into a recession. If the economy slows too much, the broader market could go lower and earnings growth might underperform.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Real Estate, BuildingPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 11 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Buy, we selected 11 stocks with competitive advantages with profit margins higher than 15% and EPS Next 5 Year Ratio higher than 10% according to FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Since it is an estimate, the EPS Next 5 Year Ratio can change from time to time depending on economic developments, company specific developments, and analyst views.Given economic and corporate developments, profit margins will also change, sometimes substantially from quarter to quarter given many factors, including potentially one time factors, affect net income.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG) share price has flown 100% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite. In the last week shares have slid back 2.4%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Principal Financial Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 58% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 26% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 4.49.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Principal Financial Group has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Principal Financial Group's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Principal Financial Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 123%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Principal Financial Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats: Top 5 Among Hedge Funds. Investors are regaining confidence in the stock market as the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 4.92% year-to-date return. Moreover, global inflation is likely to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023,  as reported by International Monetary Fund in January. The report also mentioned that 84% of countries are expected to experience lower headline inflation this year as compared to 2022. Considering this positive outlook of the market, investors show an inclination toward stocks that would help them achieve stable regular income. In this regard, dividend-focused companies with strong dividend growth track records remain popular among investors.Dividend growers have historically outperformed their peers, becoming top choices for investors. According to a report by Merrill Edge, an American financial services company, dividend stocks can help to alleviate portfolio losses when stock prices fall. The report further highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — stocks that have raised their dividend for 25 years or more — delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market. In addition to this, dividend stocks reflected a volatility of 13.22%, in contrast with a 14.22% volatility for the S&amp;P 500.Analysts expect that dividend stocks will be able to maintain their performance in 2023 as well.

However, the value of these stakes grew to $32.2 billion this quarter, from $27.1 billion a quarter earlier.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX).

Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational healthcare company that develops medical devices.

The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 in February and maintained a Hold rating on the shares, highlighting the company's solid recent quarterly earnings.Artisan Partners mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American multinational beverage corporation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is next on our list of top dividend stocks among hedge funds.

With 400 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company, based in Illinois.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Lowe's Companies, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP), worth over $4.4 billion collectively.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”.

Moreover, global inflation is likely to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023,  as reported by International Monetary Fund in January. The report also mentioned that 84% of countries are expected to experience lower headline inflation this year as compared to 2022. Considering this positive outlook of the market, investors show an inclination toward stocks that would help them achieve stable regular income. In this regard, dividend-focused companies with strong dividend growth track records remain popular among investors.Dividend growers have historically outperformed their peers, becoming top choices for investors. According to a report by Merrill Edge, an American financial services company, dividend stocks can help to alleviate portfolio losses when stock prices fall. The report further highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — stocks that have raised their dividend for 25 years or more — delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return of the broader market. In addition to this, dividend stocks reflected a volatility of 13.22%, in contrast with a 14.22% volatility for the S&amp;P 500.Analysts expect that dividend stocks will be able to maintain their performance in 2023 as well. According to UBS, dividends per share in the S&amp;P 500 will grow by 1% this year, even with a potential 11% decline in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The financial services company also estimated that dividends per share could grow by 20% in the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids a recession.Story continuesMcDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some of the most important companies that have raised their dividends for a significant period of time. Moreover, these companies have strong cash flow generation that promises further dividend growth.

Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is an American multinational healthcare company that develops medical devices. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.29%, as of February 24.

The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $87 in February and maintained a Hold rating on the shares, highlighting the company's solid recent quarterly earnings.Artisan Partners mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58An American multinational beverage corporation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is next on our list of top dividend stocks among hedge funds.

The collective value of these stakes is over $28.8 billion. With 400 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company, based in Illinois. In January, Barclays raised its price target on the stock to $125 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's medical device growth.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), one of the top dividend stocks among hedge funds, currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share.

These stakes are collectively valued at over $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a renewable energy company, based in Florida, US.

(NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

120,fcb51d08-0714-3caa-8972-b8617c53a319,UNP,2023-02-26,Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after Union Pacific Corporation's (NYSE:UNP) latest 3.8% drop adds to a year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-adopt-severe-120054784.html,1677412854,STORY,['UNP'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Union Pacific's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 43% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockEvery investor in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 80% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 3.8% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 20% for shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Union Pacific, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Union Pacific. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Union Pacific?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Union Pacific already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Union Pacific's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Union Pacific. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.4% by the third-largest shareholder.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Union PacificWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Union Pacific Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$190m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.
