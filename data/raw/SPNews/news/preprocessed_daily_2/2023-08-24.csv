The announcement led to a 5% fall in Schwab shares on Tuesday but did not hurt investor appetite for its new bonds.Schwab's sale of $1 billion in three-year bonds and $1.35 billion in 11-year bonds - callable after 10 years - attracted investor orders worth three times the amount sought by the company.""The strong response shows bond investors, at least in the near term, have gotten over their worries about the credit fundamentals of top-tier regional banks after the banking crisis in March,"" said Richard Wolff, head of U.S. syndicate at Societe Generale.Dan Krieter, credit strategist at BMO Capital, said Schwab may be more insulated from the risk of significant deposit outflows since ""their deposit situation is not akin to traditional banks.""Schwab has been losing cheap deposits - unused cash lying in brokerage accounts - as customers moved that money to other banks or products paying higher interest rates.The company has previously made public statements this year that while client deposits may move, they are not leaving the firm.The company's picture is ""not very rosy but they are not doing as bad compared to some of their peers,"" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.""They were losing out deposits earlier this year - which seem to have stabilized now as they became more competitive - and we don't see any liquidity crisis with them at the moment,"" he said.Story continuesSchwab has had to rely on more expensive funding sources to supplement its cash flow, such as certificates of deposit (CD) or borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. This has hurt the company's profitability.Schwab's management expects deposits to increase by the end of the year, and said the company has already reached peak usage of high-cost funding.The improved outlook likely helped generate interest from fixed income investors, according to David Del Vecchio, co-head of U.S. investment grade corporate bonds at PGIM Fixed Income.Schwab's bond trade also drew attention as new investment grade bond supply this month has so far been lower than expected.""It's been very, very light with the calendar the past few weeks,"" said Natalie Trevithick, head of investment-grade credit at asset manager Payden &amp; Rygel in Los Angeles.Counting Schwab's $2.35 billion in bonds, investment-grade bond volume sits at just $3.45 billion for the week and $67.1 billion so far in August, according to Informa Global Markets data.

However, there’s a wide variety of those out there that reward their shareholders handsomely.And with technology’s blistering run in 2023, many are seeking exposure to the momentum.Three stocks – Broadcom AVGO, Texas Instruments TXN, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise HPE – all pay their shareholders and have grown their payouts over the last five years.For those seeking a passive income stream paired with technology exposure, let’s take a closer look at each.BroadcomBroadcom is a premier designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the revisions trend particularly notable for its current fiscal year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s shares currently yield a solid 2.2% annually, well above the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector average.

The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company’s shares aren’t valuation stretched, further reflected by the Style Score of “A” for value. HPE shares presently trade at a 7.9X forward earnings multiple (F1), nicely beneath the 10.7X five-year median and highs of 14.4X in 2022.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHPE shares presently yield a solid 2.9% annually paired with a payout ratio sitting at 62% of the company’s earnings. The company’s payout has grown by 1.6% annualized over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTexas InstrumentsTexas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. The company is the definition of a consistent earnings performer, exceeding consensus earnings and revenue expectations in ten consecutive quarters.TXN delivered an 8% EPS beat in its latest release and reported revenue 4% ahead of expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTXN shares would interest many income-focused investors, currently yielding nearly 3% annually. And the company has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, sporting a 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s worth noting that the company is expected to witness a growth slowdown, with Zacks Consensus Estimates for its current year indicating 21% lower earnings on 10% lower revenues.

Shares have added about 4.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Range Resources due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Range Resources Q2 Earnings Top on Lower Total CostsRange Resources reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 30 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents. However, the bottom line declined from the prior-year quarter’s level of $1.23.Total quarterly revenues of $586 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $584 million. The top line, however, declined from the prior-year quarter’s $1057 million.Better-than-expected quarterly results were driven by lower total costs and expenses. However, lower realizations of commodity prices partially offset the positives.Operational PerformanceThe company’s production averaged 2,080.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day (Mcfe/d) in the reported quarter, up 0.3% from the prior-year period’s level. The figure beat our estimated total production of 2070.4 Mcfe/d. Natural gas accounted for 68.3% of total production, while NGLs and oil contributed to the rest.Oil production declined 8% year over year, while NGL output increased 6%. Natural gas production decreased 2%.Its total price realization (excluding derivative settlements and before third-party transportation costs) averaged $2.47 Mcfe, down 66% year over year. Notably, price realization was even lower than our estimate of $2.91 Mcfe. Natural gas prices declined 75% on a year-over-year basis to $1.74 per Mcf. NGL prices declined 50%, while oil prices fell 36%.Costs &amp; ExpensesTotal costs and expenses declined to $592 million from $668.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Transportation, gathering, processing and compression costs, which form a major part of the total costs, came down to $268.2 million from $320.4 million in the prior-year period.Story continuesCapital Expenditure &amp; Balance SheetThe company’s drilling and completion expenditure amounted to $166 million in the reported quarter. An amount of $9 million was used in acreage and gathering facilities.It had a total debt of $1,772.6 million at the end of the quarter.OutlookFor 2023, Range Resources reiterated its total production of 2.12-2.16 billion cubic feet equivalent per day, with 30% attributed to liquid production.RRC projected a capital budget of $570-$615 million for the year. Direct operating expenses are estimated to be in the range of 11-13 cents per Mcfe, while exploration expenses are projected in the band of $22-$28 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -9.61% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Range Resources has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C.

Shares have lost about 2.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nucor due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Nucor's Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues LagNucor reported earnings of $5.81 per share for second-quarter 2023, down from earnings of $9.67 per share in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share, however, topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59.The company recorded net sales of $9,523.3 million, down around 19% year over year. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,733.8 million.The company benefited from higher realized prices. It also benefited from high margins for steel mills units and increased profitability for its direct reduced iron (DRI) facilities in the reported quarter.Operating FiguresTotal sales tons to outside customers for steel mills in the second quarter were 4,774,000 tons, a 5% decrease year over year. It fell short of our estimate of 4,925,000 tons.Average sales price for steel mills was $1,168 per ton, which fell 18% year over year but was up around 13% sequentially. It also beat our estimate of $1,088 per ton.Overall operating rates at the company's steel mills increased to 84% in the second quarter of 2023 compared with 79% in the first quarter of 2023 and decreased from 85% in the second quarter of 2022.Segment HighlightsEarnings of the company’s steel mills unit rose 67.5% on a sequential basis in the reported quarter on higher margins.Earnings in the steel products division were higher by 4.1% sequentially in the second quarter due to higher volumes.The raw materials segment’s earnings were up 138% sequentially on higher profitability from the company’s DRI facilities.Story continuesFinancial PositionCash and cash equivalents were $4,510.6 million at the end of the quarter, up 125% year over year. Long-term debt was $6,620.7 million, flat year over year.The company repurchased roughly 3.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $147.03 per share during the quarter.OutlookFor the third quarter of 2023, the company foresees a sequential decrease in earnings. This projected decline is primarily due to reduced profitability from the steel mills segment, with the most significant impact at the sheet mills.Additionally, the steel products segment is also expected to experience a moderation in earnings during the third quarter of 2023 on a sequential basis.Moreover, the raw materials segment is projected to witness a decrease in earnings for the third quarter of 2023 in comparison to the second quarter. This can be attributed to margin compression at the company's DRI facilities and scrap processing operations.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, Nucor has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

18,aecc9fd6-6fc0-3653-8052-1bfcfe236d79,TMO,2023-08-24,Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) shareholders have earned a 18% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-tmo-140017026.html,1692799217,STORY,['TMO'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) share price has soared 121% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. In the last week shares have slid back 1.4%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Thermo Fisher Scientific achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 17% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Thermo Fisher Scientific, it has a TSR of 124% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Thermo Fisher Scientific had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.8% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 6.0%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 18%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Thermo Fisher Scientific better, we need to consider many other factors.

An In-depth Valuation Analysis,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-holdings-modestly-undervalued-153613680.html,1692804973,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF) has experienced a daily loss of -3.19%, but over the past three months, the stock has gained 15.06%. The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at 12.08. Despite these fluctuations, is the stock modestly undervalued? This article conducts a detailed valuation analysis to answer this question. Read on to uncover the insights.Introduction to CF Industries HoldingsCF 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CFCF Industries is a leading producer and distributor of nitrogen fertilizers with seven nitrogen facilities in North America. It also holds joint venture interests in the United Kingdom and Trinidad and Tobago. CF primarily uses low-cost U.S. natural gas as its feedstock, positioning it as one of the lowest-cost nitrogen producers globally. The company is also investing in carbon-free blue and green ammonia, which can be used as an alternative fuel to hydrogen or as a means to transport hydrogen.CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) is currently trading at $74.3 per share, while its estimated fair value, also known as the GF Value, stands at $90.61. This discrepancy suggests that the stock might be undervalued.Is CF Industries Holdings Modestly Undervalued? An In-depth Valuation AnalysisUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary valuation method that calculates the intrinsic value of a stock. This calculation is based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to the GF Value, CF Industries Holdings appears to be modestly undervalued. The GF Value suggests that the stock's fair value is derived from historical multiples, the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns.Story continuesGiven that CF Industries Holdings is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Is CF Industries Holdings Modestly Undervalued? An In-depth Valuation AnalysisLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of CF Industries HoldingsInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. A great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company is looking at the cash-to-debt ratio. CF Industries Holdings has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.99, better than 58.19% of 232 companies in the Agriculture industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of CF Industries Holdings at 7 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Is CF Industries Holdings Modestly Undervalued? An In-depth Valuation AnalysisProfitability and Growth of CF Industries HoldingsInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. CF Industries Holdings has been profitable 9 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $8.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $12.08. Its operating margin is 41.09%, ranking better than 95.61% of 228 companies in the Agriculture industry. Overall, the profitability of CF Industries Holdings is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. If a company's business is growing, it usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. CF Industries Holdings's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 83.41% of 217 companies in the Agriculture industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 53.9%, ranking better than 83.98% of 206 companies in the Agriculture industry.ROIC vs WACC ComparisonAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, CF Industries Holdings's ROIC is 28.16, and its cost of capital is 10.01.Is CF Industries Holdings Modestly Undervalued? An In-depth Valuation AnalysisConclusionOverall, CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) stock appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 83.98% of 206 companies in the Agriculture industry.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:The overall earnings picture remains stable and resilient, with the outlook actually starting to improve over the last few months. The revisions trend has notably stabilized lately, with estimates for several key sectors increasing.This evolving earnings outlook remains inconsistent with the long-feared ‘earnings cliff’ narrative.For the 480 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, total earnings are down -8.5% from the same period last year on +0.8% higher revenues, with 79.4% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates.For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -2.0% on +0.5% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.4% on +3.2% higher revenues.The somewhat mixed showing from the traditional retailers in their Q2 earnings reports was primarily due to management execution and less a function of any significant moderation in consumer spending.We discussed Target TGT last week, which missed top-line and comp estimates but did better on margins and inventories. We noted that while management appeared satisfied with current inventory levels, investors will be justified in wondering whether Target has really addressed the issue if Q2’s weak sales and traffic trends will result in unsold inventory in the coming periods.Story continuesUnlike Walmart WMT, whose quarterly report showed all-around strength, Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Walmart stumbled last year following its Q1 report, as did Target, but it recovered quickly. In its Q2 report, Walmart benefited from broad market share gains and momentum in key growth initiatives.While Walmart has a much bigger grocery business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise, demand for which has moderated in the post-Covid period. That said, Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 96% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.2023 Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -2.0%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.The long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either.These growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management’s guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Free Report: Top EV Battery Stocks to Buy NowJust-released report reveals 5 stocks to profit as millions of EV batteries are made.

We noted that while management appeared satisfied with current inventory levels, investors will be justified in wondering whether Target has really addressed the issue if Q2’s weak sales and traffic trends will result in unsold inventory in the coming periods.Unlike Walmart WMT, whose quarterly report showed all-around strength, Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Story continuesWalmart stumbled last year following its Q1 report, as did Target, but it recovered quickly. In its Q2 report, Walmart benefited from broad market share gains and momentum in key growth initiatives.While Walmart has a much bigger grocery business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise, demand for which has moderated in the post-Covid period. That said, Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 96% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.2023 Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -2.0%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see from these quarterly earnings-growth expectations, the long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either, as you can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThese growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management’s guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.""A similar warning came this month from the world's largest retailer, Walmart.""Jobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers.

These programs could helpTransUnion's head of global research and consulting Charlie Wise tells Yahoo Finance that roughly 40 million consumers will face the ""payment shock"" when student debt relief ends.A man carries flowers and balloons during Los Angeles Mission College's 48th annual commencement ceremony on June 6, 2023. (Hans Gutknecht/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images via Getty Images)Consumers were already having trouble paying off credit card debt, as Macy's warned this week. Now, the return of student loan payments could make financial matters worse, with execs warning that the extra expense may lead consumers to pull back spending in other areas.Yahoo Finance takes a look at the consumer stocks with the most at risk.Retailers with most student loan payment exposureSome retailers appear more vulnerable to repayment shock than others heading into the crucial back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.Story continues""We are most cautious on brands with high exposure to student debt holders and inferior value perceptions amongst 18-34-year-olds, the most representative demographic of student debt holders,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients.The research team at TD Cowen highlighted Target (TGT) and Ulta (ULTA) as particularly vulnerable, due to their exposure to younger, low-income consumers with student loans.""The resumption of student loan repayments is one of many factors that we're watching really closely,"" Target CFO Michael Fiddelke told Yahoo Finance as the retailer slashed its full-year profit outlook.Other ""most-exposed"" stocks to younger, lower-income student borrowers, according to TD Cowen analysts, include Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), FIGS (FIGS), Foot Locker (FL), Burlington Stores (BURL), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote that US student debt borrowers will likely pull back spending on apparel overall since they ""prefer brands over private label and specialty retailers over discounters.""This is bad news for American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Carter's (CRI), Crocs (CROX), Canada Goose (GOOS), The Gap (GPS), Nordstrom (JWN), Nike (NKE), Steven Madden (SHOO), Under Armour (UAA), and Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. (VSCO), Sole said.Stores with a higher discretionary product mix also face higher risk, according to JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers.That includes Target and Ulta, Horvers noted, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Best Buy (BBY), followed by Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Costco (COST), and Walmart, with the primary difference driven by the former group's higher mix of discretionary product.On the flip side, auto parts stocks are less at risk ""given their lower-income exposure and low discretionary mix,"" Horvers wrote in a note to investors.Meanwhile, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) ""remains a question mark"" as its ""geo-weighted exposure to student loans ranks it high offset by its largely non-discretionary mix (85% grocery),"" Horvers added.Restaurants watch for sales weaknessWhen it comes to spending at restaurants, TD Cowen's Charles said he estimates up to ""a 2% annual headwind to restaurant industry spending as student loan payments resume.""The team at TD Cowen suggested Jack in the Box (JACK), Dutch Bros (BROS), and Sweetgreen (SG) may face headwinds. Investors should also tread lightly with tobacco and beverage brands, such as Altria Group (MO), British American Tobacco (BATS), and Monster Beverage (MNST).Even higher-end plays in the restaurant space aren't immune.Cava — where a salad bowl can set one back $14 — expressed caution on the consumer outlook in its latest earnings.CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance that student loan payments restarting was one of the ""multitude of factors"" up against consumers, along with higher gas prices, costly utility bills, and a ""hawkish Fed.""""So we're mindful of those pressures,"" Schulman said. ""We saw a resilient consumer in Q2, but we'd be remiss if we didn't take those considerations into account.""Of course, not all borrowers will have to pay right away.Those still in school remain ""in the regular forbearance period,"" TransUnion's Wise points out. ""But we think that about 26 million-27 million consumers will be facing the beginning or resumption of payments in the next couple of weeks.""There's another catch: The Department of Education is instituting a 12-month ""on-ramp"" for repayment from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024. Though interest will accrue during this period, financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments won't be considered delinquent or reported to credit bureaus and debt collectors.Cowen's Charles said in a note to clients this ""likely pushes any major impact to spending to late next year.""Are you an American with student loan debt or a company nervous about the return of student loan payments?

30,ea47b749-74b2-33a7-9a21-75056bb17ef3,WMT,2023-08-24,15 States with the Highest College Tuition and Fees,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-states-highest-college-tuition-173816739.html,1692812296,STORY,"['FDX', 'WMT']","[In this article, we look at 15 states with the highest college tuition and fees. You can skip our detailed analysis on educational statistics in the US, and head over directly to our article, 5 States With The Highest College Tuition and Fees.The Bureau of Labor Statistics in its findings established a direct link between an individual’s earnings and level of education attainment. Last year, those who had less than a high school diploma earned $682 a week, whereas individuals with some college or associate degree were making a little over $1,000. On the other hand, bachelor’s and master’s degree holders were earning $1,432 and $1,661, respectively, indicating that income tends to rise with more education.According to the US Census Bureau, in 2021, about 14.9% of the American population aged 25 and above had some college education but not a degree, whereas 10.5% held an associate degree. In terms of higher education, 23.5% had completed a bachelor’s degree, while 14.4% had a master’s or another advanced degree as their highest level of education.Making College Education More AccessibleSeveral corporations in the US are making education more accessible by offering tuition reimbursement programs for their employees, and in some instances their children as well. This includes Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which in 2021 announced to spend up to $1.2 billion on education and skills training for its workforce, including a program to pay 100% of the cost of education for hourly wage employees in the company, which would cover their tuition, fees, and books. Over 750,000 workers of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are eligible for this program.Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), another company offering education incentives for its employees is FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), where ground package handlers can claim up to $5,250 in tuition reimbursements. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) also maintains a partnership with Robert Morris University, which allows employees who have completed college education to get enrolled for a university degree at a discount. Under this initiative, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) workers can work and also attain higher education through online classes from anywhere they wish to.Story continuesThe Live Better U (LBU) education program was launched by Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in 2021 to cover 100% of the college education costs of its employees. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) plans on investing $1 billion over five years till 2026 on this initiative, which is likely to enable 1.5 million workers in the company to avail this incentive. Considering that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the largest retail companies in the world, and the biggest private employer in the US, the Live Better U program has the potential to also boost the education industry on a whole along with increasing the level of educational attainment of its workforce.Besides companies that offer reimbursement programs, it is worth mentioning the contribution of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Office 365 Education program in making education more affordable and accessible. Students and teachers at schools, colleges and universities can sign up for the program and avail free access to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s platforms such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and more. All of these tools are taught in educational institutions across the world and are widely used in the job market as well.Loan Repayment Assistance ProgramsHigh costs of education often force students to take loans to pay their tuition and fees. $29,000 is owed on average by each borrower who took out a student loan. All 50 states in the US offer some kind of a loan relief program that could be availed to pay off all or part of your loan balance, in exchange for working or providing services in professions the state requires you to.California, for instance, offers loan assistance up to $50,000 for full time healthcare workers who are willing to serve for at least two years in a federally designated shortage area with an underserved community. Kansas provides $15,000 in loan relief to students moving into the state’s Rural Opportunity Zones. While loan assistance programs and their requirements vary by state, it has been observed in a report by Forbes that professions like healthcare workers, dentists, veterinarians, and teachers qualify for these programs more than other occupations do.MethodologyWe have used the Annual Survey of Colleges released by The College Board in 2022 to rank states with the highest college tuition and fees in America. Average tuition and fees for in-district students enrolled in two-year college programs in public institutions of the US were considered. States are ranked in ascending order of average tuition and fees. Alaska is not part of our analysis, as results for the state were not included in the Annual Survey of Colleges.If interested, you can also take a look at states that have the most affordable college education in our recent article, 15 States With The Lowest College Tuition and Fees.15 States With the Highest College Tuition and FeesAntonio Guillem/Shutterstock.comLet’s now head over to the list of states with the highest college tuition and fees.15.

31,6c40ae82-d680-30ac-afb7-0794f98c7328,RJF,2023-08-24,Raymond James Survey: Investors’ Top Priorities for Safeguarding Generational Wealth,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-survey-investors-top-133100372.html,1692797460,STORY,['RJF'],"[ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Aug. 23, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Raymond James released the results of its recent survey of investors with half a million dollars or more in investible assets, revealing their priorities and concerns around transferring wealth to the next generation. Some estimates predict that up to $84 trillion in assets will exchange hands over the next 20 years – dubbed the Great Wealth Transfer – prior to which it’s essential to identify potential gaps and opportunities for investors to execute a successful transition, according to Joe Weaver, President of Raymond James Trust.Key findings:71% of respondents said proactive communication of wealth transfer plans would be important to them if they were receiving an inheritance, while 45% report being “extremely transparent” with their own heirs.91% of respondents said that tax efficiency is “extremely” or “somewhat” important, but 37% answered “no” or “not sure” when asked if their wealth transfer plan includes tax efficient strategies.54% of respondents agree that having a positive philanthropic impact is “extremely” or “somewhat” important to their intergenerational wealth transfer plan.84% of respondents who work with a financial advisor have a documented intergenerational wealth transfer plan in place, compared to 66% who do not work with an advisor.“The most important factor in executing a smooth transfer of wealth is having a documented plan in place and to regularly revisit that plan over the years to make sure it’s properly representing your current wishes,” said Weaver. “The most common reasons for a break down in a client’s plan are, first, the absence of preparation and taking the time to put appropriate documents in place. Second is not thoroughly communicating their intentions to those impacted.”Communication with HeirsMaintaining family harmony sits high on the list of priorities for investors, 87% of respondents said it’s important to them (60% “extremely”, 26% “somewhat”). This level of harmony is mainly achieved through proactive communication (7 in 10 say it’s important) and transparency. 89% indicated that, if they were inheritors, having clear and transparent expectations for who would receive what would be important.Story continuesHowever, understanding the value of communication is not the same as taking steps to start a conversation around wealth. More than half of American adults don’t talk about their finances and 23% would even rather talk about death, according to research from Empower.“For many, an ideal scenario would be to take a set dollar amount and divide it equally among heirs, but that’s rarely the case. With illiquid assets to consider such as property, collectibles, businesses, heirlooms and so on, the task of dividing assets equitably becomes more complex,” said Weaver. “This is where discord in the family can begin if a client’s intentions aren’t clearly communicated.”Investors with $500,000 or more in assets appear to be more comfortable discussing wealth than average, with 81% asserting that they have been at least “somewhat” transparent with heirs (45% say they have been “extremely” transparent). Consistent communication might start small with discussions about monthly budgets or annual donations and build on that foundation of financial values to help heirs feel empowered to address changing circumstances, continued Weaver.Tax Efficient Estate PlanningTaxes are another top-of-mind issue among those passing on wealth. 9 in 10 respondents said tax efficiency is a somewhat-to-extremely important part of their wealth transfer planning. However a significant number of investors (37%) either do not, or do not know whether they have an estate plan that includes tax-efficient strategies.Given the complexities of tax code and the regularity of rule changes, taxes may feel like a moving target to investors and require the help of a professional. But only 26% of those surveyed have consulted tax professionals as part of their planning. For wealthy grantors, more complex vehicles such as trusts, specialized insurance and structured giving may be necessary to maximize their legacy, according to Weaver.Imparting Charitable ValuesMore than half (54%) of respondents said having a positive philanthropic impact is an important part of passing their legacy successfully from one generation to the next. They aren’t alone in the sentiment, with many of the world’s wealthiest pledging to give away most of their significant wealth. While the majority of investors take a more moderate approach, 1 in 10 respondents plan to leave 25% or more of their wealth to charity.If they were receiving an inheritance, 60% of respondents said it would be important (24% “extremely,” 46% “somewhat”) to hear impactful stories that shaped their grantor’s values and personal character. This presents an opportunity for investors to share the beliefs and philanthropic vision behind an inheritance with their heirs.“It’s difficult to memorialize your values and wishes in a legal document, so one solution that’s becoming more prevalent is the inclusion of a legacy letter. A client can sit down and write about the lessons and stories that they want to be sure reach the next generation. Then the letter is either attached to the planning documents, or more often, read and recorded over video to be passed on,” said Weaver.Weaver also suggests that grantors may choose to create a personal or family mission statement or develop a philanthropy “board” amongst heirs to convey their goals. To maximize impact, they might explore less-common gifts like appreciated stock or life insurance and specialized vehicles like donor advised funds or charitable trusts.Guidance from a Team of ProfessionalsGiven the complex and personal nature of wealth transfer planning, professional guides are often enlisted to help. The three most frequently tapped professionals for survey respondents’ teams are financial advisors, estate planning attorneys and accountants. Some also include family members or even spiritual advisors in their planning.To set themselves up for success, investors should take a critical look at their professional team over the years and adjust based on changing needs, says Weaver. For example, planning to transfer assets beyond money such as art collections, luxury vehicles or rare collectibles often requires specialized knowledge.Respondents who work with a financial advisor in particular were more likely to have a documented wealth transfer plan in place (84%) compared to those who don’t work with an advisor (66%). Seeking guidance helped respondents address top concerns like taxes, with 68% of those working with an advisor reporting that they had tax-efficient strategies included in their wealth transfer plan, versus 50% of those who don’t work with an advisor.Overall, 93% of respondents working with financial advisors said they feel prepared (52% “extremely,” 41% “somewhat”) in regard to their wealth transfer planning. With preparation comes peace of mind, as 82% report that working with a financial advisor increased their confidence in their plans, and just over half (54%) say it increased their confidence significantly.“Financial advisors are in a unique position to guide the wealth transfer process, from recommending the appropriate professionals to walking a client through next steps,” said Weaver. “The advisor often has an established relationship with the client and their family and can lean on that experience to help build a custom communication plan that will work best for the family’s personal dynamics and expectations.”Survey MethodologyThis survey was conducted by Raymond James in partnership with Morning Consult between November 18 and November 24, 2022. Responses were collected online from a sample of 1,000 U.S. investors with $500,000 or more in investible assets. Results from the full survey have a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.About Raymond James Financial, Inc.Raymond James Financial, Inc.

The Fed raised rates in July after pausing in June. Futures traders expect another pause in September, but the outlook on whether another rate hike this year will happen is foggier. There's about a 35% probability of another quarter-point hike in November.What the Fed does longer term is also something investors will be listening for in Powell's speech. Some analysts have been projecting that rate cuts could come sometime next year, though others believe rates will have to stay higher for longer in order to achieve the inflation goals.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1.

One such stock that merits attention is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH). The stock, which is currently priced at 17.19, recorded a loss of 0.41% in a day and a 3-month increase of 18.45%. The stock's fair valuation is $59.59, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NCLH. Click here to check it out. NCLH 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NCLHThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap?Considering the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.2, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a hidden gem or a value trap? These indicators suggest that Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.A Snapshot of Norwegian Cruise Line HoldingsNorwegian Cruise Line is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths (at more than 60,000), operating 30 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. The company had redeployed its entire fleet as of May 2022. With seven passenger vessels on order among its brands through 2028 (representing 19,000 incremental berths), Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Norwegian sails to around 700 global destinations.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap?Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's historical data, 2021: -0.13; 2022: -0.33; 2023: -0.38, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 28.67; 2020: 21.68; 2021: 0.08; 2022: 5.74; 2023: 16.54; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-32%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap?The Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.ConclusionIn conclusion, despite its seemingly attractive valuation, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings presents significant investment risks. The company's declining revenues and earnings, coupled with its low Altman Z-score, suggest that it may be a potential value trap. Investors are advised to conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. To wit, the Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) share price has flown 152% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock!With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Gartner To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Gartner achieved compound earnings per share growth of 64% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 36% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Gartner has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Gartner's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Gartner shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 10% over the last year. However, that falls short of the 18% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Gartner is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...Story continuesIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Firefighters from throughout the region battled the blaze for 20 hours and hazardous chemicals were later detected in water around the facility. However, ""The volume of contaminated soil/groundwater wouldn't warrant National Priorities List (NPL) status,"" EPA spokesperson Kellen Ashford said in an email to the Des Moines Register on Tuesday, confirming a July 24 enforcement memo in which EPA Region 7 On-Scene Coordinator Eric Nold wrote that the charred factory is not ""proposed for"" the Superfund site list.Firefighters work to control a blaze at C6-Zero on Thursday, Dec. 8, 2022, in Marengo, Iowa. The plant breaks down asphalt shingles into fiberglass, gravel and oil.Ashford also said agency officials don't believe chemicals from the site will affect Marengo's drinking water wells.More: Months after C6-Zero explosion, fire, ill ex-employees wonder what they were exposed toThe Iowa Department of Natural Resources on April 25 asked the EPA to oversee the factory's cleanup after officials with C6-Zero missed state-enforced deadlines to remove contaminants from the area. The EPA can issue larger fines than the state to companies that fail to meet cleanup deadlines.Founded by entrepreneur Howard Brand, C6-Zero rented an old soybean crushing factory in Marengo in 2020 and installed a system it claimed would dissolve discarded asphalt shingles into oil, fiberglass and gravel. Former C6-Zero employees have expressed numerous concerns about how the plant operated before the explosion, and said the solvent the company used to melted the shingles made them sick.Story continuesThey also said company officials declined to tell them what chemicals they were working with, a potential violation of federal regulations that C6-Zero denied. The factory exploded when vapors from the chemicals sparked during a test run of the system in front of a group of investors.Months after the explosions, some employees told the Register they still felt sick, with frequent headaches. One worker said one of her kidneys stopped functioning properly.More: 'Vomiting on a daily basis': What workers say it was like inside C6-Zero before the explosionAccording to an EPA administrative settlement reached July 27, a cleanup contractor collected about 31,000 gallons of dark water with an oily sheen around the factory in the days after the blast. The contractor stored the liquid in tanks, and samples of the water showed ""elevated levels"" of some hazardous chemicals. Researchers previously linked some of the substances to cancer and kidney damage.In Iowa, 12 locations currently are on the EPA's National Priorities List, including the since-mitigated former site of the Dico wheel and pesticides factory off W. Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway in Des Moines, now slated for a pro soccer stadium.""Final assessments will help make the final determination if NPL status should be considered (in Marengo),"" Ashford said.EPA expects the site to be cleaned up by the end of the yearA pile of soil outside the burned C6-Zero plant in Marengo on Saturday, May 5, 2023.In a notice issued in late July, EPA officials gave C6-Zero a set of deadlines for the cleanup process. If the company does not meet those targets, the EPA can issue a series of fines that can reach $5,000 a day, depending on how far behind the company falls.Ashford said C6-Zero met its deadlines for the first two steps, producing a safety plan to protect workers and a disposal plan for the contaminated water and soil. But the EPA rejected the disposal plan, which Ashford said was ""incomplete."" C6-Zero had not filed an updated plan as of Tuesday.""EPA will prioritize the review of the disposal plan once the agency receives the document,"" Ashford said.Mark Corallo, a spokesperson for C6-Zero, downplayed the significance of the rejection.""C6-Zero has been collaborating with the EPA and our environmental firm on appropriate cleanup and disposal plans,"" Corallo told the Des Moines Register in an email. ""As you might expect with such a project, there is back and forth about proposals and plans and that is what has occurred between the agency and our environmental firm. Everything is on track and moving ahead.""More: How do you get rid of 85K gallons of tainted water, 15M pounds of soil from C6-Zero site?In his memo, Nold wrote that he expects C6-Zero to finish cleaning up the site by the end of the year. He added that the company's contractor began hauling wastewater to a disposal site near Harper, Kansas, in May but paused disposal ""pending additional funding"" from C6-Zero. Ashford added that the EPA doesn't expect the contractor to haul more liquid until the agency approves C6-Zero's disposal plan.C6-Zero also has submitted documents that the memo said show it can provide $3 million in financial assurance to the agency ― the expected cost of the cleanup ― and its compliance with a requirement that it provide proof of insurance that covers up to $1 million in general liability, with a $5 million umbrella policy, Ashford said. EPA officials are reviewing both submissions.According to the EPA's notice to C6-Zero, the federal regulators can take over the cleanup if they deem in necessary. The EPA could fine C6-Zero $250,000 if it does.In May, the Iowa Occupational Health and Safety Administration fined C6-Zero $96,000 for 11 violations of workplace standards. Spokespeople for Iowa OSHA did not respond to emails from the Register seeking comment Wednesday, but Corallo said the fine has been paid.EPA: 'Elevated levels' of several dangerous chemicals found in water collected on siteAccording to the EPA's memo, samples of water collected from the factory and stored in tanks after the explosion detected hazardous chemicals in concentrations above federal and state standards. Those chemicals include:Tetrachloroethylene (PCE), a dry-cleaning agent and metal degreasing solvent. PCE can cause cancer ""by all routes of exposure,"" according to the EPA. Long-term exposure can harm kidneys, the liver, and the central nervous and immune systems and blood.Cis 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE), which can affect the kidneys and liver.Lead, which can impact a host of the central nervous system and organs including the kidneys.Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are chemicals that occur naturally in coal, crude oil and gasoline and can cause anemia and liver damage. The EPA classifies them as possible carcinogens.In his memo, Nold wrote, ""Hazardous substances ... have been released to the environment, and there remains a threat of additional release due to the continued presence of hazardous substances stored in tanks and totes on the site.""Tyler Jett is an investigative reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Russia and Ukraine are among the world's biggest grain exporters.In his remarks, Putin also said Russia had more than 30 energy projects in African countries, adding that Russian fuel supplies would help African governments to contain price rises.""Over the past two years, exports to Africa of Russian crude oil, petroleum products and liquefied natural gas have increased by 2.6 times,"" he said.Putin added that the global transition to a greener, low carbon emissions economy would have to be ""gradual, balanced, carefully calibrated"", given projections for further growth in the world's population and energy demand.Russia is keen to build up the BRICS group - which currently comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - into a more influential bloc able to challenge Western domination of the global economy.At its three-day summit in Johannesburg this week, the BRICS leaders agreed toinvitesix more countries - Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - to join the bloc.In his remarks on Thursday, Putin took aim at former colonial Western powers and their espousal of what he called ""neo-liberalism"", which he said posed a threat to both traditional values in developing countries and to the emergence of a multi-polar world where no one country or bloc dominated.

Despite the rebound the index is still down more than 4% for August - its worst month since last September.Even before the Nvidia release after the bell on Wednesday, the S&amp;P500 had put in its best day since June - and futures were higher again ahead of Thursday's open. European and Asia bourses were higher, with even Shanghai ekeing out a small gain.But with markets now awaiting some fresh policy signals from Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell's speech on Friday at the annual Jackson Hole conference, the recoil in sky-high bond borrowing rates promises a firmer foundation for the broader markets rally.Ironically, the retreat in bond yields comes amid signs of cooling economic activity - but that comes with the significant relief that central banks may not have to squeeze any harder to get inflation back close to targets.Story continuesInfected partly by China's spluttering rebound, August global business surveys missed forecasts again and showed multiple contractions across sectors and countries in Europe.U.S. survey readings also undershot expectations - but, yet again, they showed overall activity still expanding in contrast to the reading across the Atlantic. The dollar touched its best levels in more than 10 weeks as European currencies swooned and held firm again on Thursday.Fears of an overheated jobs market also eased a touch. Benchmark data revisions for the year through March showed the red-hot U.S. labour market was not quite as blistering as originally reported - with official estimates of total payroll employment that month cut marginally by 306,000.New home sales data has something for everyone, with a surprising jump of more than 4% in July as house prices recorded a drop of almost 9% compared with a year earlier and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate topped 7.3% for the first time since 2000.All of which spins into Powell's speech - with markets watching closely whether the Fed boss will openly acknowledge a re-acceleration of U.S. demand this summer even after more than five percentage points of policy rate hikes in 18 months.Bond yields are in retreat in advance of the speech, helped by the easing economic data and a decent 20-year bond auction on Wednesday. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields remained below 4.2% and hit their lowest in more than a week, with two-year yields holding back below 5%.Helping the bond bounce and ongoing disinflation hopes has been a fresh pullback in energy prices, with crude oil prices hitting their lowest for the month and year-on-year declines in crude running back close to 20%.The energy picture was helped further in Europe after Woodside Energy reached an agreement with unions at Australia's largest liquefied natural gas project, potentially averting a disruption to supplies.

Benchmark data revisions for the year through March showed the red-hot U.S. labour market was not quite as blistering as originally reported - with official estimates of total payroll employment that month cut marginally by 306,000.New home sales data has something for everyone, with a surprising jump of more than 4% in July as house prices recorded a drop of almost 9% compared with a year earlier and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate topped 7.3% for the first time since 2000.All of which spins into Powell's speech - with markets watching closely whether the Fed boss will openly acknowledge a re-acceleration of U.S. demand this summer even after more than five percentage points of policy rate hikes in 18 months.Bond yields are in retreat in advance of the speech, helped by the easing economic data and a decent 20-year bond auction on Wednesday. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields remained below 4.2% and hit their lowest in more than a week, with two-year yields holding back below 5%.Helping the bond bounce and ongoing disinflation hopes has been a fresh pullback in energy prices, with crude oil prices hitting their lowest for the month and year-on-year declines in crude running back close to 20%.The energy picture was helped further in Europe after Woodside Energy reached an agreement with unions at Australia's largest liquefied natural gas project, potentially averting a disruption to supplies. The agreement led to a more than 11% decline in wholesale gas prices on Thursday, extending losses following a 15% drop in the previous session.Events to watch for on Thursday: * U.S. July durable goods orders, weekly jobless claims, Kansas City Fed August business surveys, Chicago Fed July business survey * Kansas City Fed hosts Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole * U.S. corporate earnings: Intuit, Ulta Beauty, Dollar Tree * U.S. Treasury auctions 30-year inflation-protected securities, 4-week bills(By Mike Dolan, Editing by Bernadette Baummike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

PUBGY, Omnicom Group Inc. OMC and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. IPG.Industry: Advertising and MarketingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2139614/3-advertising-marketing-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-woesThe rise in service activities, along with increased digital marketing services and the success of the work-from-home trend, is enabling the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry to counter the prevailing revenue softness.Customer-centric approaches to business, digital strategies and technology investments are helping Publicis Groupe S.A., Omnicom Group Inc. and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. to sail through the current testing times.About the IndustryThe Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry comprises companies that offer an extensive range of services, including advertising, branding, content marketing, digital/direct marketing, digital transformation, financial/corporate business-to-business advertising, graphic arts/digital imaging, healthcare marketing and communications, and in-store design services. Prominent players from the industry include Interpublic and Omnicom.The pandemic has changed the way industry players have conducted business and delivered services so far. Currently, the industry’s key focus is on channelizing money and efforts toward media formats and devices. To position themselves suitably in the post-pandemic era, service providers are increasing their efforts toward formulating strategic initiatives and identifying sources of demand.What's Shaping the Future of the Industry?Economic Recovery: The sector is a major beneficiary of the broader economy and service activities. According to the ""advance"" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.4% in the second quarter of 2023 compared with 2% growth in the first quarter. The Fed’s decision to pause interest rate hike in June after ten straight increases offered relief to the global economy.Story continuesEconomic activities in the non-manufacturing sector are in good shape. The Services PMI measured by the Institute for Supply Management has stayed above the 50% mark for the past seven months, indicating continued expansion.Reviving Demand: The industry is mature, with demand for services remaining stable over time. Revenues, income and cash flows are anticipated to gradually reach the pre-pandemic levels, aiding most industry players to pay out stable dividends.Digital Marketing Gathering Steam: Amid the pandemic, digital media consumption has shot up, with consumers spending more time on various media platforms and video-streaming services. Thus, agencies offering digital marketing services stand to gain, as these firms are better positioned to address the rapid change in customer preference.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term ProspectsThe Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry, housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216. This rank places it in the bottom 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term.

PUBGY, Omnicom Group Inc. OMC and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. IPG to sail through the current testing times.About the IndustryThe Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry comprises companies that offer an extensive range of services, including advertising, branding, content marketing, digital/direct marketing, digital transformation, financial/corporate business-to-business advertising, graphic arts/digital imaging, healthcare marketing and communications, and in-store design services. Prominent players from the industry include Interpublic and Omnicom. The pandemic has changed the way industry players have conducted business and delivered services so far. Currently, the industry’s key focus is on channelizing money and efforts toward media formats and devices. To position themselves suitably in the post-pandemic era, service providers are increasing their efforts toward formulating strategic initiatives and identifying sources of demand.What's Shaping the Future of the Industry?Economic Recovery: The sector is a major beneficiary of the broader economy and service activities. According to the ""advance"" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.4% in the second quarter of 2023 compared with 2% growth in the first quarter. Fed’s decision to pause interest rate hike in June after ten straight increases offered relief to the global economy. Economic activities in the non-manufacturing sector are in good shape. The Services PMI measured by the Institute for Supply Management has stayed above the 50% mark for the past seven months, indicating continued expansion.Story continuesReviving Demand: The industry is mature, with demand for services remaining stable over time. Revenues, income and cash flows are anticipated to gradually reach the pre-pandemic levels, aiding most industry players to pay out stable dividends.Digital Marketing Gathering Steam: Amid the pandemic, digital media consumption has shot up, with consumers spending more time on various media platforms and video-streaming services. Thus, agencies offering digital marketing services stand to gain, as these firms are better positioned to address the rapid change in customer preference.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term ProspectsThe Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry, housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216. This rank places it in the bottom 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, FirstEnergy is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while WEC Energy Group has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that FE likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than WEC has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.FE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.24, while WEC has a forward P/E of 18.46. We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2.21. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.21.Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P/B ratio of 1.88. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WEC has a P/B of 2.24.These metrics, and several others, help FE earn a Value grade of B, while WEC has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesFE is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that FE is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock is Yahoo Finance's number one trending ticker.""Nvidia served up a whopper,"" said Stifel analyst Brian Chin in a client note.That's about on the mark.Net sales surged 101% from the prior year to $13.51 billion. Earnings per share improved a staggering 429% year on year.Similar to its mind-blowing May outlook that rocked Wall Street, Nvidia served up another eye-popping forecast that is sending analyst estimates sharply higher.Nvidia's October quarter sales outlook of $16 billion was significantly above consensus forecasts for $12.6 billion. Chatter on the Street is that it was materially above elevated buy-side whisper numbers, too.""The world has something along the lines of about a trillion dollars' worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise and otherwise,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on the earnings call. ""And that trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time.""Here's what Wall Street is saying about Nvidia's latest quarter:Wedbush analyst Dan Ives: ""The Street was awaiting on pins and needles the quarter/guidance from Nvidia after the bell and the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered in homerun fashion. The entire tech sector and overall market was waiting for Nvidia with this being the purest and best barometer for AI demand and the results/guidance were a 'drop the mic' moment in our opinion that will have a ripple impact for the tech space for the rest of the year. As my collegue Matt Bryson and the rest of the Wedbush tech team has continued to discuss again and again over the last six months this is an unprecedented demand that we are seeing before our eyes in the AI Gold Rush. The October quarter guidance of $16 billion was well above $12.6 billion estimates and quickly rising whisper numbers on the Street and will be fuel in the engine to ignite a tech rally we see continuing into the rest of the year despite the recent pullback and Fed jitters (Jackson Hole meeting) in the air.”Story continuesCiti analyst Atif Malik: ""We believe management did a good job addressing the three key topics we highlighted: AI demand, supply, and China. Management sees “tremendous” broad-based AI demand across CSPs, consumer/internet, and enterprises with visibility extending into next year. Supply is expected to grow through the year into next year with some products like L40S GPU not requiring advanced packaging. China remained stable at 20-25% of data center sales as US led the data center growth. We hike our FY24/25/26 EPS by 42%/37%/23% and raise target price to $630 on consistent 35x P/E revised CY25 EPS of $18. Maintain Buy.”Nvidia logo displayed on a phone screen and microchip and are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on July 19, 2023. (PJakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)Baird analyst Tristan Gerra: ""The convergence of accelerated computing and generative AI is driving very significant growth for Nvidia's data center products. Strength is broad based, while Grace should add another significant growth layer starting next year and likely not fully priced in. Significant increases in CoWoS capacity give us confidence in a doubling of DC revenue for next year, while we expect strength in generative AI demand to be ongoing for many quarters. Data center densification trend will continue likely redirecting away from traditional DC spending. Reiterating Bullish Fresh Pick, Outperform-rated.""Stifel analyst Ruben Roy: ""Following another exceptional quarter, significantly stronger-than-expected outlook, and extended demand visibility, we upgrade our rating on NVDA shares to Buy. While we have long viewed NVDA as the primary beneficiary of the increasing investments being made on large language models/generative AI training clusters, we underestimated the opportunity related to the potential shift of $1 trillion of installed data center infrastructure from general purpose compute to accelerated compute architectures. As data center compute demand continues to expand, longer-term data center capacity growth is increasingly constrained by power limitations and the slowing of Moore's Law. The shift from x86 based CPU infrastructure to accelerated compute (NVDA primarily today) is underway, and NVDA's recent performance and outlook (100%+ y/y revenue growth over the next few quarters) illustrates that the pivot is gathering speed.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Americans who have been shopping for a home in 2023, despite limited inventory and high mortgage rates that remain in the 6-7% range, are flocking to areas that are more affordable relative to the rest of the country, less expensive than their nearby metro area, or provide better value, offering more space at a lower price.Located exclusively in the Midwest and the Northeast, each of this year's top 10 Hottest ZIP codes in America is attracting buyers with homes that are either priced at or below the U.S. median, or are larger in size than the U.S. average. Additionally, homes listed within the Hottest ZIPs received an average of 3.6 more views per listing than in the rest of the country, and sold one month faster than average in 2023.The 2023 Hottest ZIP Codes in America, in rank order, are:43230, Gahanna, Ohio06489, Southington, Conn.07450, Ridgewood, N.J.01810, Andover, Mass.18064, Nazareth, Pa.46322, Highland, Ind.48183, Trenton, Mich.06851, Norwalk, Conn.14534, Pittsford, N.Y.63021, Ballwin, Mo.""As many companies continue to call employees back to the office, we're seeing a surge in home shoppers who are seeking a desirable combination of cost and convenience within commuting distance of major metropolitan areas,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""In addition to affordable markets, this year's list also features some higher priced areas close to large urban cores, which will likely appeal to buyers who are concerned with finding the right mix of size and amenities within reach of a nearby city center.""Story continuesNo. 1 Hottest ZIP: Gahanna, Ohio This year's Hottest ZIP Code is Gahanna, Ohio (43230), which continues the legacy of Columbus, Ohio markets appearing on the Hottest ZIP codes list. The greater Columbus area offers home buyers the amenities and quality-of-life advantages of a larger town, but at a lower price. It's home to The Ohio State University, the Short North Arts District as well as a captivating food scene. Homes in this ZIP code were priced 12.7% below the national median in June – and with more than a quarter of its population aged 25-34, it's favorable for young renters and buyers alike.Suburban space, closer commutes draw home shoppersLooking more closely at this year's hottest ZIPs, No. 3 on the list, Ridgewood, N.J. (07450), is a high-priced suburb of New York City that offers an idyllic setting with typical listings that are more than double the size of those in the NYC metro and is just a one-hour commute from Manhattan. Shoppers are willing to pay up for these amenities, and homes in the area have  a price-per-square-foot that is 7.9% higher than the metro's average. Residents of this year's No. 4 ZIP on the list, Andover, Mass. (01810), a suburb of Boston, can commute to the city in under an hour, and the area also boasts larger homes priced 25% lower per square foot than Boston listings. The typical home in No. 9, Pittsford, N.Y. (14534), was 29.3% larger than the median-sized home in the surrounding Rochester metro, less than 30 minutes from the city center by car, and despite the premium to live in this desirable village, listing viewership was more than 30% higher than the surrounding metro. Finally, Ballwin, Mo. (63021), at No. 10 on the list, is similar to these Northeast locales in that listing prices in the area tend to be higher than the metro average, but homes for sale were upwards of 30% larger than the metro's median home size.Big-city dwellers are driving demand Six of this year's Hottest ZIP codes – generally those found near big-cities – drew the majority of their property views from within their metro area, suggesting that in many areas, buyers are looking to move around locally. Additionally, those areas seeing significant interest from other locations are typically seeing it come from big-city shoppers. Reflecting this trend, No. 1 ranked Gahanna, Ohio (43230) captured the largest share of out-of-metro viewership among the Midwest metros, drawing 13.1% of its viewership from the New York City area in the second quarter of 2023. In fact, New York City was the top out-of-market viewer for seven of the 10 hottest zips.Size matters: nearly all Hottest ZIPs feature more spaceIn seven out of 10 of this year's Hottest ZIP codes, the typical home is larger than the average home in the surrounding metro area. Among the more expensive locations on the list, the typical household size is also larger, indicating that home shoppers in places such as Ridgewood, N.J. (07450), Andover, Mass. (01810) and Pittsford, N.Y. (14534) may be shopping for more space to accommodate a larger family. This is particularly true in Ridgewood, N.J. (07450), the most expensive ZIP on this year's list, where the typical household is 19.7% larger than the U.S. average of two-and-a-half people per household.Homebuyers want affordability Recent near-record high mortgage rates and still-inflated listing prices continue to create affordability challenges for homebuyers, resulting in buyer demand in areas that boast affordability. Seven of the top 10 Hottest ZIP codes offer home prices that are similar or lower than the U.S. median listing price or the prices in their surrounding metropolitan area. Notably, the Midwest saw a post-pandemic boom, as traditionally popular metros became unaffordable and many home buyers looked for value in new locations. Four major Midwest markets on this year's list are close to city centers, including Columbus, Ohio (43230 No. 1 Gahanna), Chicago, Ill. (46322 No. 6 Highland, Indiana), Detroit, Mich. (48183 No. 7 Trenton, Michigan) and St. Louis, Mo. (63021 No. 10 Ballwin, Missouri). These markets offer homebuyers prices that are 24.7% lower than the U.S. median, as well as a strong local economy and employment rates below the national average.From hot to not: West, South left outOnly the Northeast and Midwest are represented in this year's ranking, the first time in the list's history that only two regions are included. The South and West regions are not represented among this year's rankings, leaving out regions of the country that have typically contributed several markets to the list. Back in 2017 the South and West accounted for more than half of the Hottest ZIPs, and in both 2018 and 2019, these regions accounted for at least half of the top 10. High prices in the West and high price growth during the pandemic in the South are likely contributing to the shift.Among the top 10, buyers need to be prepared and move fastDespite the overall housing market starting to cool, with the average home in the U.S. spending about 45 days on the market, homes in this year's Hottest ZIP codes spent just 10 to 25 days on the market and saw three times more visitors per property on Realtor.com® in June. With inventory falling 22.4% in these ZIP codes compared to a 7.1% increase nationally, those looking to buy in these markets are facing tough competition.""Shoppers in this year's Hottest ZIP codes should cope by being prepared – pre-approved and zeroed in on their budget and down payment – and really focused on must haves versus nice-to-haves so they can be ready to act quickly when they see the right home hit the market,"" said Realtor.com® Economic Research Analyst Hannah Jones. The high price of financing a home purchase this year and still-steep competition meant successful buyers in the hottest markets also came with exceptional qualifications, with an average credit score of 754, surpassing the U.S. average of 740. Additionally, they made higher than average down payments, reaching 17.2% compared to the national average of 12.3% in the first half of 2023.One way to stay ahead of the competition in America's hottest ZIPs is to set a price alert on Realtor.com®. Simply enter your search criteria and save the search to get real-time or daily notifications when homes matching your search criteria hit the market. Additionally, if you are searching for homes in other hot areas, be on the lookout for Realtor.com® Hot Market badges on neighborhoods and home listings for insights about how fast homes are selling and how many more views they get compared to others in the area and in the U.S.2023 Hottest ZIP Codes in America – Top 50 Housing MetricsRankZipCodeZip NameMetro AreaViewersperproperty vsUSMedianDays onMarketJune 2023MedianListing Price143230Gahanna, OhioColumbus, OH4.513$389,000206489Southington, ConnecticutHartford-East Hartford-Middletown, CT5.718$410,000307450Ridgewood, New JerseyNew York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA3.318$918,000401810Andover, MassachusettsBoston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH3.319$1,117,000518064Nazareth, PennsylvaniaAllentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ3.418$446,000646322Highland, IndianaChicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI2.919$289,000748183Trenton, MichiganDetroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI3.120$280,000806851Norwalk, ConnecticutBridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT2.923$749,000914534Pittsford, New YorkRochester, NY3.521$571,0001063021Ballwin, MissouriSt. Louis, MO-IL3.123$381,0001106790Torrington, ConnecticutTorrington, CT3.025$310,0001240241Louisville, KentuckyLouisville/Jefferson County, KY-IN2.522$412,0001329414Charleston, South CarolinaCharleston-North Charleston, SC2.422$559,0001429212Columbia, South CarolinaColumbia, SC2.826$340,0001545424Dayton, OhioDayton-Kettering, OH2.623$287,0001653005Brookfield, WisconsinMilwaukee-Waukesha, WI3.127$472,0001747905Lafayette, IndianaLafayette-West Lafayette, IN2.927$419,0001843537Maumee, OhioToledo, OH3.129$307,0001908080Sewell, New JerseyPhiladelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD2.926$390,0002002703Attleboro, MassachusettsProvidence-Warwick, RI-MA2.625$449,0002101085Westfield, MassachusettsSpringfield, MA3.128$392,0002201545Shrewsbury, MassachusettsWorcester, MA-CT2.725$727,0002306708Waterbury, ConnecticutNew Haven-Milford, CT2.021$301,0002493309Bakersfield, CaliforniaBakersfield, CA2.023$340,0002559102Billings, MontanaBillings, MT2.430$410,0002675072McKinney, TexasDallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX2.126$632,0002743028Howard, OhioMount Vernon, OH2.629$475,0002813760Endicott, New YorkBinghamton, NY2.529$273,0002944805Ashland, OhioAshland, OH2.429$217,0003048640Midland, MichiganMidland, MI3.532$285,0003144903Mansfield, OhioMansfield, OH2.630$185,0003265202Columbia, MissouriColumbia, MO1.923$310,0003337415Chattanooga, TennesseeChattanooga, TN-GA2.128$450,0003404074Scarborough, MainePortland-South Portland, ME2.933$700,0003565109Jefferson City, MissouriJefferson City, MO2.430$342,0003614850Ithaca, New YorkIthaca, NY2.530$585,0003744691Wooster, OhioWooster, OH2.532$247,0003808520Hightstown, New JerseyTrenton-Princeton, NJ1.825$491,0003945601Chillicothe, OhioChillicothe, OH2.934$270,0004080920Colorado Springs, ColoradoColorado Springs, CO1.825$533,0004165804Springfield, MissouriSpringfield, MO2.131$358,0004228277Charlotte, North CarolinaCharlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC2.030$623,0004344256Medina, OhioCleveland-Elyria, OH3.835$442,0004494550Livermore, CaliforniaSan Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, CA1.827$1,410,0004535226Birmingham, AlabamaBirmingham-Hoover, AL1.928$537,0004654703Eau Claire, WisconsinEau Claire, WI2.833$327,0004761107Rockford, IllinoisRockford, IL2.930$185,0004845042Middletown, OhioCincinnati, OH-KY-IN2.129$265,0004923454Virginia Beach, VirginiaVirginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC1.622$420,0005055125Saint Paul, MinnesotaMinneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI1.928$480,000 MethodologyRealtor.com®'s Hottest ZIP Code rankings are based on an algorithm that takes into account two aspects of the housing market: 1) market demand, as measured by unique viewers per property on Realtor.com®, and 2) the pace of the market as measured by the number of days a listing remains active on Realtor.com®.

(Nasdaq: ALGN), a leading global medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells the Invisalign® System of clear aligners, iTero™ intraoral scanners, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, today announced that on August 21, 2023, the Superior Court, State of California, County of Santa Clara issued an order granting Align’s petition to confirm and denying SmileDirectClub LLC (""SDC"") petition to vacate a $63 million arbitration award entered in favor of Align.By way of background, on August 27, 2020, Align initiated a confidential arbitration proceeding against SDC before the American Arbitration Association relating to a Supply Agreement (""Supply Agreement"") entered into between the parties in 2016. Align’s complaint alleged that SDC breached the Supply Agreement’s terms, causing damages to Align. On January 19, 2021, SDC filed a counterclaim alleging that Align breached the Supply Agreement and on May 3, 2022, SDC filed an additional counterclaim alleging that Align breached the Supply Agreement. We denied SDC's allegations in the counterclaims. The arbitration hearing on our claims and SDC’s first counterclaim was held on July 18-27, 2022, in Chicago, Illinois.On October 27, 2022, the arbitrator issued an interim award on our claims and SDC’s first counterclaim finding that SDC breached the Supply Agreement, and that we did not breach the Supply Agreement. The arbitrator awarded Align an interim award in the amount of $63 million, the maximum under the Supply Agreement’s liability cap.On March 6, 2023, Align filed a petition to confirm the arbitrator’s interim award in the Superior Court of Santa Clara County.The arbitration hearing on SDC’s second counterclaim was held on February 21-23, 2023, in Chicago, Illinois and on May 18, 2023, the arbitrator issued a final award on SDC’s second counterclaim, finding that Align did not breach the Supply Agreement. The final award subsumed the interim award on our claims and SDC’s first counterclaim and concluded the Supply Agreement arbitration proceedings.Story continuesOn May 30, 2023, Align filed a petition to confirm the final award in the Superior Court of the State of California, for the County of Santa Clara. On June 16, 2023, SDC filed a petition to vacate the final award before the same court. On August 3, 2023, the Superior Court held arguments on Align's petition to confirm and SDC’s petition to vacate the final award in Align’s favor. During the hearing, the Judge noted that the arbitrator ""appear[ed] to have paid careful attention to everything."" On August 21, 2023, the Superior Court confirmed the arbitration award in favor of Align and denied SDC’s petition to vacate.SDC may appeal, but in order to do so, SDC would be required to obtain a bond of 150% of the judgment or over $94 million. If SDC’s appeal fails, SDC would be obligated to pay Align the judgment plus interest, at the rate of 10% per annum (approximately $17,000 per day).Align anticipates recognizing the award amount in the period that we determine it is realizable.About Align Technology, Inc.Align Technology designs and manufactures the Invisalign® System, the most advanced clear aligner system in the world, iTero™ intraoral scanners and services, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software.

It may not have been easy to hold on to ALGN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Align Technology's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Align Technology's main business drivers.Align Technology, based in California, manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics, and dental records storage. The clear aligner system corrects malocclusion using nearly invisible and removable appliances that gently move the tooth to a desired final position.Align Technology presently has two operating segments, Clear Aligner (83.1% of total revenues in 2022), known as the Invisalign system and Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services (Systems and Services) (16.9% of total revenues in 2022), which include the iTero intra-oral scanners and OrthoCAD services. In 2022, the Clear Aligner segment registered a revenue decline of 5.4% from 2021, while the latter registered a revenue dip of 90.46.2% from 2021.Product Portfolio:Invisalign System – An exclusive method to treat malocclusion based on a series of doctor-prescribed, custom-manufactured, clear plastic removable orthodontic aligners. The Clear Aligner products are Invisalign Express, Lite and Go, Moderate and Invisalign Comprehensive packages.The Systems and Services segment consists of iTero intraoral scanning systems, which include a single hardware platform and restorative or orthodontic software options. Our services include subscription software, disposables, rentals, leases, pay-per-scan services, as well as exocad’s CAD/CAM software solutions that integrate workflows to dental labs and dental practices.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Align Technology, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in August 2013 would be worth $7,926.74, or a gain of 692.67%, as of August 23, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 164.80% and the price of gold increased 30.54% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for ALGN too.Align Technology is expanding its global presence to address the huge untapped demand in the malocclusion space. Annually, only 21 million people globally elect orthodontic treatment and a large portion of the patient base remains unattended. To address this untapped market, the company has taken several strategic initiatives, including digital marketing in alliance with influencers and digital platforms. Also, the company has launched its first subscription-based clear aligner program DSP worldwide. Within the Scanner business, the company is scaling up the production and distribution of iTero in several countries. Innovations and market expansion efforts are helping it offset the impact of inflation and supply disruptions. However, mounting expenses are putting pressure on the operating margin. Strong FX headwind impedes growth.The stock is up 5.87% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

72,c7386438-f0ed-327f-84a0-9f0069bb4c10,MRO,2023-08-24,Marathon Oil Corporation's (NYSE:MRO) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-oil-corporations-nyse-mro-101338600.html,1692872018,STORY,['MRO'],"[Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 10% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Marathon Oil's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Oil How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marathon Oil is:18% = US$2.0b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.18 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Marathon Oil's Earnings Growth And 18% ROEAt first glance, Marathon Oil seems to have a decent ROE. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 28%. Still, we can see that Marathon Oil has seen a remarkable net income growth of 38% over the past five years. Therefore, there could be other causes behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this certainly also provides some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Marathon Oil's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 28% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is MRO fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Marathon Oil Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Marathon Oil's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 6.2%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 94% of its profits. So it looks like Marathon Oil is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Additionally, Marathon Oil has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 14% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 13%) over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Marathon Oil's performance. Specifically, we like that it has been reinvesting a high portion of its profits at a moderate rate of return, resulting in earnings expansion. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The company late Wednesday gave a much stronger-than-expected forecast amid demand for its artificial intelligence chips and said it would buy back $25 billion in stock.All of the major S&amp;P 500 sectors were down on the day, however, and an index of semiconductors dropped 3.4%.Central bankers and other economic leaders gathered Thursday for an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Powell's highly anticipated speech on the economic outlook is due Friday.""As much as investors want to focus on Nvidia and want to focus on tech - and it's been a good year so far - this is still a market that is Fed obsessed.

Treasury yields edged higher.Investors also digested comments from Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, who in an interview on CNBC on Thursday said the Fed will need to keep rates restrictive for a while.Story continuesThe Fed has been raising rates since March 2022 in an effort to bring down inflation, and investors are looking for clarity on whether more rate increases are ahead and how long the Fed plans to hold rates high.Among the day's decliners, Dollar Tree shares dropped 12.9% after the retailer forecast annual profit largely below estimates.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.99 billion shares, compared with the 10.87 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.61-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 220 new lows.(Additional reporting by Amruta Khandekar, Shreyashi Sanyal and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Shinjini Ganguli and Deepa Babington)]"

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal, Josh Schafer, and Brooke DiPalma tackle how users are adapting their platforms on the networking site like other social media apps and its revenue generation for parent company Microsoft (MSFT).Video Transcript- This was interesting. There was a story out about how LinkedIn is cool again, especially as we're seeing this reckoning of sorts across social media across the board. We had the re-brand of Twitter to X, which did cause a lot of users to leave the platform.We had threads debut. A lot of subscribers off the start, but not as much engagement and it seems like during this upheaval in this space, people are looking at LinkedIn as a reliable social media platform that they could post their work accomplishments, update people on where they're at. I deleted Facebook about a year ago and I will say, LinkedIn has been my Facebook replacement.I'm on it multiple times a day.- Yeah.- I keep tabs on all my peeps.- I think LinkedIn, for me now, has become what Twitter was when Twitter was easier to actually just look at people you follow and if you use Twitter to get information. I think that's what LinkedIn is-- there's a lot of people that post interesting threads on LinkedIn.- Yeah.- I get news off LinkedIn.- And so I think--- Family updates.- Yeah.- I think a lot of people are starting to use LinkedIn that way. I mean, this one stat that was just fascinating to me, users shared 41% more content on the network this spring than in 2021.- Wow!- I mean, that's crazy.- LinkedIn's an old company. That level of growth is pretty impressive.- Right. And also too, I did want to note this stat, LinkedIn's revenue rose to $15 billion in Microsoft's most recent fiscal quarter. That's almost triple five years ago. So it really just goes to share-- goes to show, rather, the momentum that LinkedIn is showing.Story continuesAnd also too, this sounds sort of cheesy but LinkedIn has really been sort of a thought leadership place where influencers and executives are really sharing their best quotes, their best Monday mantras. And I follow Sara Blakely, she's CEO of Spanx. I also follow her a few target executives who really share good life hacks about how to go about your work life, your personal life and balance it all. And I just find myself like you, scrolling through it, looking for that advice.- And with that, there's also come the satire side of it too. There's one guy I follow, his name is Jack Raines. He does-- I think it's the young money Substack is what he does and he sort of does financial jokes to some extent, right? And he sort of makes fun of some of the stuff that we talk about here and things like that.And one of his posts last week that I absolutely loved, he was talking about how the weekend is now the time to work because you can get ahead. He's like, go out on Wednesday night and show up to work a little bit later, Thursday, because no one works on Saturday and Sunday so they can get ahead everyone. Sort of--But I feel like--- Making a joke on some of the founder advice and stuff you see, but it's funny, right? And once you start getting funny and educational, then you're having real social media and real--- Gamification.- Right, and like a real discourse on social--- And you can follow now. I'm sure he has a following, a subscriber.- Over 30,000 followers on LinkedIn, he has and--- I feel like--- And he's basically posting jokes. That's awesome.- He used to-- he probably would have posted on X, on Twitter, formerly, and so them sort of gaining this momentum from it and really exemplifying just day-to-day life as opposed to what, say our parents LinkedIn used to be where it's just strictly about work. I remember at college, it was a huge push because no one really wanted to jump on, but now I feel like there's young people who are really looking to build their portfolio on it.- Also tangible advice and tangible resources. There's LinkedIn people that are employed by the company that can help you with your resume, that can help you get certifications. I mean, you can actually gain things by using the platform consistently. So I think there's a lot of wins here for LinkedIn.- Yeah.- Absolutely.- I'm bullish on LinkedIn.]"

And unlike the autumn days it celebrates, there seems to be no chill in customer demand.Starbucks’ Pumpkin Spice Latte goes on sale Thursday in the U.S. and Canada, as it does each year when the nights start getting longer and the fall winds gather. It’s the coffee giant’s most popular seasonal beverage, with hundreds of millions sold since its launch in 2003. And it has produced a huge — and growing — industry of imitators flecked with cinnamon, nutmeg and clove.In the year ending July 29, U.S. sales of pumpkin-flavored products reached $802.5 million, according to Nielsen. That’s up 42% from the same period in 2019. There are pumpkin spice Oreos, protein drinks, craft beers, cereals and even Spam. A search of “pumpkin spice” on Walmart’s website brings up more than 1,000 products. A thousand products that smell or taste like, well, pumpkin pie.For better — and, some might say, for worse — the phenomenon has moved beyond coffee shops and groceries and into the larger world. Great Wolf Lodge is featuring a Pumpkin Spice Suite at five of its resorts this fall, decked out with potpourri, pumpkin throw pillows and bottomless pumpkin spice lattes.It has also spawned a vocal group of detractors — and become an easy target for parodies. Comedian John Oliver once called pumpkin spice lattes “the coffee that tastes like a candle.” There's a Facebook group called “I Hate Pumpkin Spice” and T-shirts with slogans like “Ain't no pumpkin spice in my mug.”The haters, though, appear to be in the minority. Last year, Starbucks said sales of its pumpkin spice drinks — including newer offerings like Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew — were up 17% in the July-September period. And in a 2022 study of 20,000 Twitter and Instagram posts mentioning pumpkin spice, just 8% were negative, according to researchers at Montclair State University in New Jersey.BEFORE THE LATTE: WHAT PUMPKIN SPICE WASStory continuesIt wasn’t always this way.Canned pumpkin and pie spices were relegated to the baking aisle when Starbucks began experimenting with an autumn drink that would replicate the success of the Peppermint Mocha, which took the winter holidays by storm in 2002. Customer surveys suggested chocolate or caramel drinks, but Starbucks noticed that pumpkin scored high for “uniqueness.” That would turn out to be prescient.In the spring of 2003, a team gathered in a lab in Starbucks’ Seattle headquarters, bringing fall decorations to set the mood. They sipped espresso between bites of pumpkin pie, figuring out which spices most complemented the coffee. After three months, they offered taste tests; pumpkin spice beat out chocolate and caramel drinks.Starbucks tested the Pumpkin Spice Latte in 100 stores in Washington, D.C., and Vancouver, British Columbia, that fall. The company quickly realized it had a winner and rolled it out across the United States and Canada the following fall. And in 2015, a watershed: The company added real pumpkin to the recipe.These days, Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte has its own handle on X — formerly known as Twitter — with 82,000 followers, and a Facebook fan group called the Leaf Rakers Society with 43,000 members. And it has fans like Jon McBrine, who drinks black iced coffee for most of the year but eagerly awaits the latte's return each fall.“I love the flavor and I love the subculture that has evolved from this huge marketing campaign,” says McBrine, a graphic designer and aspiring author who lives in the Dallas area.It’s hot through the end of October where he lives, so McBrine typically orders his with ice. But at least once a year, he gets a hot latte, savoring memories of the autumns of his childhood in Delaware.“It’s part of getting into the season,” he says. “It’s almost like a ritual, even if you’re just waiting in the drive-thru.”THE PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE AS SENSORY EXPERIENCEJason Fischer, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies human perception through sight, sound and smell, says odor and flavor have a more direct route than other senses to the area of the brain that processes memories.That’s due to evolution; humans needed to remember which foods were safe to eat. But it means smells and memories are closely linked.Still, he said, people’s sense of smell can be malleable. In experiments, subjects have taken a sniff of something and described it in many different ways. But when they’re shown a label for that smell — say, “pumpkin spice” — their perceptions shift and their descriptions become more similar.“Odors and sights go with certain places, like the aroma of pine and the crunching of needles beneath your feet,” he says. “They’re associated with a certain kind of experience. And then marketing taps into that, and it’s a cue for a product.”Pumpkin spice doesn’t conjure happy memories for everyone. Kari-Jane Roze, who lives in Fredericton, Canada, loves many things about autumn, including back-to-school routines, changing leaves and hockey. But she’s not a fan of pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread — and she has a particular dislike for pumpkin spice lattes.“The artificial flavor is disgusting,” says Roze, who works at New Brunswick Community College. “The only thing I do not like about fall is seeing everyone obsess over PSLs. Makes me want to shut off social media for a month.”She won’t have to deal with those ""PSLs"" for long. The limited-time nature of the product is another thing that keeps customers hooked, marketing experts say. Last year, Starbucks’ holiday-themed drinks arrived on Nov. 3. And then, for devoted fans, the wait begins anew.]"

Yahoo Finance Live tries out some of the company's 2023 fall drinks and discusses how customer hacks have impacted the fall menu.Video Transcript- Starbucks is back with their pumpkin spice latte for the 20th year in a row. Can you believe it? The Starbucks pumpkin-spice latte debuted back in 2003. It's now the 20th anniversary. And it's not just the pumpkin spice latte anymore. The pumpkin cream cold brew is returning for the fifth year, alongside a new creation debuting from customers hacks. It's called the ice pumpkin cream chai latte. Say that three times fast.It has chai tea. It's topped with pumpkin cream cold foam and pumpkin spice [? nozzle ?] tea. Offerings have expanded beyond just pumpkin. They now have an apple crisp oatmeal macchiato, and a shake, and espresso version of that. Since cold sales really have boomed, 75% of total beverage sales last quarter were cold. And we got an inside look. They do debut on Thursday, August 24, but we got a first taste. Cheers. Cheers. So Ali, what do you have right now?- Yeah. I have the chai tea.- OK.- My goodness. This is sweet.- Right.- Whoo.- I did get an inside taste on that, and it is very sweet.- Over sweet?- It's just--- It's sweet, man.- It's flavorful.- Yeah.- And it has a lot going on.- I mean, it's really good.- Now, this is a customer hack, and this just goes to show the companies that are really fun weighing in on listening to customers, weighing in on social media, and building on that. I mean, you know--- So customers actually suggested?- Requested this last year because as we talked about before, those modifiers, that pumpkin cream cold brew people, adding that on top of their drink is something that they saw. And so they decided to add it to the menu.- And I think it's smart to expand beyond the coffee drinkers because the chai tea is very popular at Starbucks, and a lot of people use it. How about you? I know you're not a pumpkin fan.Story continues- This is my first pumpkin spice latte.- First one ever.- Took him 20 years.- We got a first-timer over here.- Right. What's the review?- I'm kind of in on it.- Ooh.- Yeah. I drink black coffee.- I'm shocked.- I'm shocked.- I drink black coffee strictly.- Oh my god.- You're like the espresso king.- Yeah. I really like it.- No. It does use real pumpkin.- I like Starbucks espresso. I like the Pike Place coffee.- Mm-hmm.- OK.- I like the cold brew.- Wow. I'm shocked.- But I would mix this in maybe every now and then. Maybe like a weekend coffee.- And that's exactly what they're looking for after 20 years, looking for new customers to keep on coming. But other ones, other names have joined in. We're thinking Dunkin'. We're thinking Wendy's, potentially, getting in on the buzz. So lots more to come. The PSL season has only begun.- All right. Well one more cheers to pumpkin season.- [LAUGHS]]"

This marks the longest losing streak for Nike since the company's IPO in 1980. Yahoo Finance Live discusses some of the challenges Nike and other companies, like Starbucks (SBUX) and Qualcomm (QCOM), are facing in the country.Video Transcript- Nike is suffering a record-losing streak as slow recovery In China continues to batter the retailer. The company slid for the ninth straight session yesterday, marking the longest downward trend since its 1980 IPO for its shares. We're taking a look at Nike's stock here on the day even, and shares of NKE as we pull them up for our viewers on screen, you're seeing them slipping. Once again, they're down by about 4%.And for those who kind of think back to what the company had to say in the 22 times that China was mentioned in its most recent earnings call, the company continues to really round out how they're looking at the expansion in Southeast Asia and India. But of course, with one of the world's largest youth populations of course, in China, where young consumers seeking top product innovation, Gen Z coming of age as the country's most active generation ever. It's amazingly critical to get the strategy right in that region.- Yeah, and they make about an estimated 14% or so, according to Bloomberg, of their sales from China, from greater China this year. That number's fluctuated a little bit. But the point is they get a decent chunk of their revenue from the likes of China.So we focused not just on Nike and what's been happening as of late and the slide that it's been seeing there, but we've talked a lot about the other American companies that get a big chunk of the revenue from China. You think of Starbucks off the top of your head. A lot of tech companies also, of course, rely heavily on China. Qualcomm gets a large percentage of its revenue from China according to Barron's, and some of the other chip makers as well. So that's something to keep in the back of your mind when thinking about China exposure for companies.Story continuesAnd then there are also some of the Casino companies that rely on Macau that we've seen sort of wax and wane according to the whims of the Chinese authorities and what kind of curbs they're putting on spending at casinos there. So there's quite a lot of companies that fall into this category.- Yeah, there are. And I think for Nike, it's also worth noting here that as we were looking through some of the results from other retailers that carry Nike products where Nike even with its direct to consumer strategy, which has been wildly successful for the company in driving more of that connection and engagement and being able to even round out more of a digital touchpoint with end consumers and not have to go through a middleman of a retailer like a Foot Locker or like a Macy's, of course, in some instances, they still retain that partnership.So you can glean a little bit of how Nike is being impacted and perhaps even in the share price action today, how some of that might be derivative of what we're hearing from the likes of a Foot Locker even.And the mix, the inventory mix and the product mix that's flying off of shelves this year compared to last year wildly different. Last year, it was all about what panda dunks you could get. This year, it's more increasingly about, where are people leaning into some of the different running categories? Where Nike is going up against the HOKA, they're going up-- and HOKA and Decker outdoor brands. They're going up against comfort in Crocs even.But in all of the considerations that the brand has in terms of the mix and where it's sold, creating even more digital touchpoints that sell at full price has been the challenge in this environment too.- Yes, that's been a challenge for everybody, as we talked about earlier, that the promotioning is back. One more thing to note about Nike. Here we are in the thick of retail earnings season. We heard from Dick's, we heard from Foot Locker, which could potentially presage bad numbers maybe for Nike. We've gotten a lot of Chinese economic data. Again, that could potentially, if you extrapolate, be bad for Nike.We don't actually hear from Nike in terms of its earnings probably until the end of September, because they are on a different earnings reporting schedule. So that's just something to keep in mind. Yes, they could come out with an update at some point. But in the absence of that, investors are left to just sort of wonder what to make of all of these various crosscurrents that we're talking about. And maybe, and not maybe because it's happening today, they're going to sell first and ask questions later.- Yeah.- Try to verify later, I guess.- Sip some tea leaves the best they can. Do you sip a tea leaf?- You scatter them and you look at them.- OK.- Yeah, or you look at them, the dregs in the bottom of the cup and try to read them. That's where it comes from.- Bingo.- I don't know how to do it, but that's where the expression comes from.- It's complex.]"
87,e48db3b5-bbcf-4608-94b4-e9d85f825650,SBUX,2023-08-24,Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte returns for 20th year — here's how the fall flavor became so lucrative,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-returns-for-20th-year--heres-how-the-fall-flavor-became-so-lucrative-140425522.html,1692799465,STORY,"['SBUX', 'WEN', 'TWNK', 'TWNKW', 'GIS', 'DNUT', 'NSRGF', 'NSRGY']","[Starbucks' (SBUX) Pumpkin Spice Latte is back, signaling the unofficial start to fall.Twenty years after the drink was first floated to consumers, it has evolved into a cultural phenomenon and prompted other seasonal offerings at Starbucks and beyond.The highly anticipated Pumpkin Spice Latte — or PSL, as Starbucks trademarked it — returns to Starbucks locations on Thursday, August 24, and will stay until the return of the holiday menu.Beyond the PSL, the fall lineup now consists of the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew for the fifth year alongside a new addition created by customers ""hacking the menu"" — the Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte, a chai tea latte, topped with pumpkin cream cold foam and pumpkin spice dust.Starbucks' fall menu has expanded beyond pumpkin too. The fall menu lineup also includes an apple crisp oat milk macchiato and a shaken espresso version of the drink as cold drinks continue to trend well for the brand. At its high-end Reserve locations, Starbucks offers the Pumpkin Spice Latte, in addition to a pumpkin spice espresso martini and a pumpkin spice whiskey barrel-aged iced latte.Starbucks fall beverage lineup, including 3 out of 5 pumpkin offerings (Courtesy: Starbucks).Boost to Starbucks' bottom lineIt all started with a piece of pumpkin pie and espresso, Peter Dukes, one of the original creators of PSL told Yahoo Finance. Believe it or not, the PSL was almost called the Fall Harvest Latte.At the time, Dukes was a product manager on the espresso team and was tasked with replicating the success Starbucks found with its mocha holiday offering in 2002. Little did he and his team know, they were on the brink of tapping into what is now a nearly billion-dollar business.Starbucks first launched the Pumpkin Spice Latte in 100 stores in Washington, D.C., and Vancouver, British Columbia, on Oct. 10, 2003.The coffee chain then rolled out the PSL nationally in 2004. It gained momentum around 2014, in part due to the rise of Instagram (META) and social media buzz, and now, the pumpkin spice flavor business is a key sales driver.Story continuesA reporter's pumpkin spice latte, purchased at a Starbucks in Baltimore. (Christina Tkacik/Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) (Baltimore Sun via Getty Images)In the US and Canada, the company has sold ""hundreds of millions"" of Pumpkin Spice Lattes, a Starbucks spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.But given that Starbucks keeps its exact PSL sales well-guarded, it's hard to break out just how much pumpkin spice boosts sales.""The challenge is those numbers are already reflected in 2022's sales base,"" Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop told Yahoo Finance, ""so there's not necessarily an 'incremental' lift from those sorts of platforms on a year-over-year basis.""Regardless, the PSL effect gets people in the door at the coffeehouse.Foot traffic typically jumps after Starbucks brings back its fall menu, data from Placer.ai shows, and the hype is only growing each year.In 2019, traffic jumped 14% in the seven days following the launch compared to average weekly visits five weeks prior.And in 2022, when Starbucks brought back its fall menu on August 30, that foot traffic nearly doubled, with a 25.7% increase in store visits. In the company's Q4 2022 earnings call, Starbucks' former CEO Howard Schultz said the reintroduction of pumpkin spice in 2022 led to its biggest sales week in the company's history.Starbucks rival Dunkin saw a similar, but smaller success, with its rollout on August 17 last year. Foot traffic jumped 9.5% in 2022, up from 6.7% in 2019.A nearly billion-dollar businessThe pumpkin market that Dukes tapped into in 2003 has become a gold mine for food and consumer brands.As of the week ending July 29, 2023, the business of the ""pumpkin flavor"" itself is worth over $802 million, per data from NielsenIQ obtained by Yahoo Finance.The market for pumpkin-flavored products has grown 14.9% from the same time period the year before, though the overall number of sales slipped for the second year, down 1.5%.Unsurprisingly, others have looked to capitalize on the flavor too.Wendy's (WEN) is reportedly launching a pumpkin spice frosty. Meanwhile others, including 7-Eleven, Krispy Kreme (DNUT), Goldfish (CPB), Hostess (TWNK), Nestlé Toll House (NSRGY), and General Mills's Cheerios (GIS), have put out pumpkin spice products of their own.Dukes said all the ""copycats"" are flattering.""I always looked at copycats as the most sincere form of flattery possible,"" he said. ""I think it's helped grow this platform. ... You could down a grocery aisle now, there's a whole industry trade around [it].""And while some customers complain that brands are introducing their fall menus earlier and earlier, many still flock to get a first sip of fall in the days after the launches.""It's obviously a huge business for brands like Starbucks, which is why it keeps getting rolled out earlier every season,"" Dunlop said.But do expect to pay more for the drink than the typical latte. The PSL now costs between $5.75-$6.75. Back in 2005, it cost a mere $3.35.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

92,31744e0c-4077-365c-b8b8-5b1b11b34f3e,XEL,2023-08-24,Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-wall-street-lower-ratings-174349282.html,1692812629,STORY,"['BAC', 'G', 'BZ', 'PODD', 'XEL', 'TGT', 'CERT']","[In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks recently downgraded by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.On August 23, stocks and bonds rose as economic data supported the idea that major central banks might halt interest rate increases to avoid a recession. Before Nvidia Corp.'s earnings report, there were notable gains in the stock market, primarily driven by the performance of major tech companies. Additionally, a US government report suggested that the downward revision of job growth in the year leading up to March might be around 306,000 jobs, a smaller correction than some economists had predicted. In response to data indicating limited customer demand, US business activity saw minimal expansion, causing two-year Treasury yields to decrease by 10 basis points, falling below 5%. Simultaneously, the 10-year German interest rate declined due to a heightened contraction in private-sector activity across the euro area. US new-home sales surged in July, reaching the highest point in more than a year due to ongoing advantages for homebuilders caused by limited supply in the resale market. Purchases of new single-family homes notably grew by 4.4% last month, totaling an annualized rate of 714,000, although this figure was adjusted downward for previous months. Government data released on Wednesday revealed these figures, surpassing the median prediction of 703,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Furthermore, a gauge of backlogs saw a reduction, hitting its lowest level for this year.According to a report from CNBC, economic conditions in Europe have worsened, with recent data indicating the lowest levels since April 2013, excluding Covid-affected months. The eurozone, comprised of 20 nations sharing the same currency, grew 0.3% in Q2 and 0.1% in Q1. Analysts polled by Refinitiv predict that the European Central Bank will likely maintain its current main rate of 3.75%. Business activity in Europe contracted further in August, reaching its lowest point since November 2020. The flash composite purchasing managers' index for the eurozone fell to 47.0 in August from July's 48.6, missing the expected 48.8. Figures above 50 signify growth, while figures below 50 indicate contraction. Excluding Covid-impacted months, this data indicates the weakest reading since April 2013. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, noted that the service sector's decline matches the struggling manufacturing performance. The services PMI hit a 30-month low at 48.3, while manufacturing PMI slightly improved from 42.7 in July to 43.7 this month. Based on PMI figures, Rubia projected a 0.2% contraction for the eurozone in Q3. The region's growth was 0.3% in Q2 and 0.1% in Q1, influenced by higher interest rates, energy costs, and subdued external demand. Differences within the region are evident, with Germany experiencing a significant business activity decline in August. This data shapes discussions on the European Central Bank's upcoming decisions. After the July meeting, President Christine Lagarde suggested potential rate hikes or pauses hinging on new data.Story continuesOn the precious metals market side, gold prices rose significantly by 1%, reaching a high point that hasn't been seen in two weeks. This increase can be attributed to the decline in U.S. bond yields and a slight dollar weakening. As investors eagerly anticipate the Jackson Hole symposium, they seek insights into potential interest rate shifts. The current value of spot gold stands at $1,916.50 per ounce, and U.S. gold futures experienced a notable 1.1% rise, reaching $1,946.30. Of note, the flash U.S. composite PMI revealed that business growth in the United States has been sluggish in August, particularly within the service sector. All eyes are now directed toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium. This speech is anticipated to provide valuable cues regarding the trajectory of interest rates. According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, there is a strong 88.5% likelihood that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current rates during the upcoming September meeting. It's important to understand that gold's responsiveness to increasing U.S. interest rates is grounded in opportunity cost. As interest rates rise, the cost of holding assets that don't yield returns, like gold, becomes relatively higher. This dynamic often impacts the demand for gold. Moreover, the wider precious metals market saw positive movement. Notably, spot silver recorded a gain of 3.4%, bringing it to $24.18 per ounce. Similarly, platinum experienced an increase of 1.8%, reaching $934.79, and palladium rose by 1.9%, reaching $1,285. This overall upward movement in precious metals aligns with the ongoing market trends.On the stocks market front, notable stocks such as Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ:CERT) were downgraded by analysts, among many others. Check out the complete article to see some other stocks recently downgraded by analysts.Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks10. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: +1.22 (+0.62%)On August 21, Baird downgraded Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) rating from ""Outperform"" to ""Neutral"" and lowered the price target from $320 to $219. This change follows a survey of 25 endocrinologists who were asked about the use of GLP-1 in type two diabetes management. The downgrade reflects a more cautious outlook based on insights from the survey, suggesting a potential shift in Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) market dynamics and growth prospects.The Ithaka Group made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) is a medical device company focused on the design, development and commercialization of insulin pump systems for people with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. Insulet’s insulin pump system is superior to traditional multiple daily injections because it provides its users with a more accurate and pain free way to administer insulin when compared to injecting it via syringe multiple times per day. Insulet’s stock was under pressure following news that Medtronic purchased EOFlow, the manufacturer of the EOPatch, a tubeless, wearable and fully disposable insulin delivery device. While the EOPatch is not yet launched in the US, it is widely believed it will be available by the end of 2024, increasing competitive pressure on Insulet.”09. Kanzhun Limited (NASDAQ:BZ)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: 0.00 (0.00%)Kanzhun Limited (NASDAQ:BZ) runs BOSS Zhipin, an online job search platform that connects job seekers with employers. The company generates revenue by providing recruitment services to job seekers and enterprise clients through its mobile apps and websites. On August 22, Macquarie analyst Danny Lee significantly adjusted his stance on Kanzhun Limited (NASDAQ:BZ). Previously having held an 'outperform' rating for the company, Lee has now revised his recommendation to 'neutral'. This modification could indicate a shift in Lee's assessment of Kanzhun's future performance and market dynamics. Such changes in analyst recommendations can carry substantial implications for investors as they reflect the evolving perceptions and insights within the financial industry. Similar to Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ:CERT), Kanzhun Limited (NASDAQ:BZ) is yet another stock that has recently faced analyst downgrades.08. Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.01 (-0.02%)Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) has shown minimal movement in the trading session on August 22 due to an announcement from Bank of America. The bank has decided to downgrade the stock's rating from 'Buy' to 'Neutral', accompanied by a notable adjustment in the price target. Previously set at $72, the new target now is $60. This decision comes in light of recent challenges faced by Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) in regulatory matters within Minnesota and Colorado. These regulatory setbacks could have impacted the company's operational outlook and strategic trajectory. Additionally, the potential liabilities associated with wildfires have raised concerns, prompting a reevaluation of the stock's investment potential. Bank of America's rating change highlights their reassessment of Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) short to mid-term prospects. The shift from a 'Buy' to a 'Neutral' recommendation could reflect Bank of America's view that the stock's previous upside potential might now be more tempered due to the regulatory hurdles and potential financial risks linked to wildfire liabilities.07. Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -1.50 (-0.77%)On August 21, TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza downgraded Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR), moving from an 'Outperform' to a 'Market Perform' rating, lowering the price target from $200 to $194. This shift led to around 0.77% drop in Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR) stock on August 22. Vitanza cited the company's recent substantial surge in value, alongside weaker global economic growth affecting demand for finished steel products and coking coal indices. Despite acknowledging Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR) strong management and prudent cash flow distribution, Vitanza's decision was influenced by the significant reduction in the gap between the stock price and the value determined through discounted cash flow analysis. Much like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ:CERT), Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR) is now part of the group of companies experiencing recent analyst downgrades. This occurrence suggests a broader trend where analysts are reassessing their outlook on various stocks.06. Genpact Limited (NYSE:G)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.39 (-1.07%)On August 22, a significant alteration emerged in the evaluation of Genpact Limited (NYSE:G) by an analyst from JPMorgan. Previously maintaining a 'neutral' rating on the stock, the analyst has now opted for a more cautious stance by downgrading it to an 'underweight' rating. This adjustment in the analyst's perspective could suggest a heightened concern about the stock's near-term performance and the potential challenges it might face.In conjunction with this change in rating, the JPMorgan analyst has introduced a new price target of $40. This figure indicates the level at which they anticipate the stock to perform in the future, and it is notably lower than the stock's current trading value. Establishing this new price target reflects the analyst's recalibration of their expectations for Genpact Limited (NYSE:G) value and growth trajectory.Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Genpact Limited (NYSE:G) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We purchased two new positions during the quarter: Genpact Limited (NYSE:G) and Dun &amp; Bradstreet Holdings Inc. Genpact is an IT services company that was spun out of General Electric several years ago. Genpact focuses on business process outsourcing (BPO) and technology digitalization markets. It has a diverse client base that is spread across multiple industries. Complexity within the IT space is growing rapidly, and Genpact plays an important role in helping customers navigate the complexity. We have owned Genpact in the past and are happy to have the opportunity to own it once again.”Click to continue reading and see Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.

The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Based on GuruFocus' valuation method, Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) appears to be modestly undervalued. The stock's fair value is estimated at $77.36, considering historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. As Xcel Energy's current price is below the GF Value Line, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesIs Xcel Energy Inc (XEL) Modestly Undervalued?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss to investors. Xcel Energy's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.01, which ranks worse than 94.95% of 475 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry, indicates that its financial strength is poor. This is further illustrated by the company's debt and cash over the past years.Is Xcel Energy Inc (XEL) Modestly Undervalued?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, carries less risk. Xcel Energy has been profitable for ten out of the past ten years, with an operating margin of 16.01% better than 59.76% of 502 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. As such, Xcel Energy's profitability is strong.Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth, according to GuruFocus research.

The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 5.5%, which ranks better than 55.75% of 461 companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC) offers another perspective on its profitability. Xcel Energy's ROIC of 4.55 over the past 12 months is lower than its WACC of 5.39, indicating a need for improvement.Is Xcel Energy Inc (XEL) Modestly Undervalued?ConclusionIn conclusion, Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) stock appears to be modestly undervalued. Despite its poor financial condition, the company demonstrates strong profitability and growth, ranking better than 55.75% of 461 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Here are the key components of Synopsys Inc's GF Score:1. Financial strength rank: 9/102. Profitability rank: 9/103. Growth rank: 10/104. GF Value rank: 3/105. Momentum rank: 9/10Each one of these components is ranked and the ranks also have positive correlation with the long term performances of stocks. The GF score is calculated using the five key aspects of analysis. Through backtesting, we know that each of these key aspects has a different impact on the stock price performance. Thus, they are weighted differently when calculating the total score. With high ranks in financial strength, profitability, and growth, but a slightly lower GF Value rank, GuruFocus assigned Synopsys Inc the GF Score of 92 out of 100, which signals the highest outperformance potential.Company Snapshot: Synopsys IncSynopsys Inc, with a market cap of $67.57 billion and sales of $5.53 billion, is a leading provider of electronic design automation software, intellectual property, and software integrity products.

""So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.""A similar warning came this month from the world's largest retailer, Walmart.""Jobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers.

(VSCO), Sole said.Stores with a higher discretionary product mix also face higher risk, according to JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers.That includes Target and Ulta, Horvers noted, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Best Buy (BBY), followed by Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Costco (COST), and Walmart, with the primary difference driven by the former group's higher mix of discretionary product.On the flip side, auto parts stocks are less at risk ""given their lower-income exposure and low discretionary mix,"" Horvers wrote in a note to investors.Meanwhile, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) ""remains a question mark"" as its ""geo-weighted exposure to student loans ranks it high offset by its largely non-discretionary mix (85% grocery),"" Horvers added.Restaurants watch for sales weaknessWhen it comes to spending at restaurants, TD Cowen's Charles said he estimates up to ""a 2% annual headwind to restaurant industry spending as student loan payments resume.""The team at TD Cowen suggested Jack in the Box (JACK), Dutch Bros (BROS), and Sweetgreen (SG) may face headwinds. Investors should also tread lightly with tobacco and beverage brands, such as Altria Group (MO), British American Tobacco (BATS), and Monster Beverage (MNST).Even higher-end plays in the restaurant space aren't immune.Cava — where a salad bowl can set one back $14 — expressed caution on the consumer outlook in its latest earnings.CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance that student loan payments restarting was one of the ""multitude of factors"" up against consumers, along with higher gas prices, costly utility bills, and a ""hawkish Fed.""""So we're mindful of those pressures,"" Schulman said. ""We saw a resilient consumer in Q2, but we'd be remiss if we didn't take those considerations into account.""Of course, not all borrowers will have to pay right away.Those still in school remain ""in the regular forbearance period,"" TransUnion's Wise points out. ""But we think that about 26 million-27 million consumers will be facing the beginning or resumption of payments in the next couple of weeks.""There's another catch: The Department of Education is instituting a 12-month ""on-ramp"" for repayment from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024. Though interest will accrue during this period, financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments won't be considered delinquent or reported to credit bureaus and debt collectors.Cowen's Charles said in a note to clients this ""likely pushes any major impact to spending to late next year.""Are you an American with student loan debt or a company nervous about the return of student loan payments?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Smucker (SJM) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.08 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on August 29, 2023.SJM has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.24%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.08 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07.SJM is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. Monster Beverage (MNST) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on November 2, 2023, Monster Beverage holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.40 a share 71 days from its next quarterly update.For Monster Beverage, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.40 is 0.24%.Story continuesSJM and MNST's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Limiting the number of EarlyBird spots could push Southwest passengers into other options for moving up in the boarding line, including buying the highest-priced fare, called “Business Select,” which comes with a top-15 spot in line.The limits on EarlyBird took effect Aug. 15. A spokeswoman for the Dallas-based airline declined to say how many early-boarding spots will be cut, calling that “privileged” information.Unlike other major U.S. airlines, Southwest does not assign passengers to specific seats ahead of time. Instead, passengers board in the order that they checked in for the flight and pick seats once they are on the plane.EarlyBird buyers can avoid the rat race and secure a prime spot in the boarding line by checking in before the normal check-in process starts, which is 24 hours before departure. EarlyBird has proven popular among passengers who want a window or aisle seat near the front — and just as importantly, room for their bag in the overhead bins.During a call with analysts and reporters last month, Southwest executives boasted that EarlyBird fees raised more than $100 million in the second quarter — about 1.4% of the airline's total revenue.“EarlyBird had been lagging a little bit through the pandemic recovery,” said Chief Commercial Officer Ryan Green, “but it performed very well in the second quarter.”Green said Southwest has been able to raise prices on boarding upgrades including EarlyBird.]"

(LUV) continues to grapple with rising expenses. Escalating fuel prices represent a concern. For third-quarter 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are expected to be between $2.55 and $2.65. For 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are now estimated to be in the range of $2.70-$2.80 (prior view: $2.60-$2.70). Fuel expenses continue to act as a major concern for the company's bottom line.Apart from the increase in fuel costs, a rise in labor and airport costs is likely to dent bottom-line growth by resulting in a spike in operating expenses. In second-quarter 2023, consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items increased 7.5% year over year. Due to an increase in labor and airport costs, as well as lower productivity levels, LUV expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 3.5-6.5% in the third quarter of 2023 from the comparable period in 2022.Partly due to these headwinds, shares of Southwest Airlines have declined 6.4% so far this year against 12.7% growth of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite such tailwinds,continued recovery in air-travel demand (mainly on the leisure front) bodes well for Southwest Airlines. In the second quarter of 2023, air traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, jumped 9.2% year over year to 35.50 billion. Capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) climbed 14.1% year over year to 42.58 billion. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) came in at 83.4%. Anticipating the trend to continue for third-quarter 2023, ASMs are estimated to improve 12% from the year-ago reported figure. For 2023, Southwest continues to expect capacity to improve 14-15% from the 2022 level.Currently, Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Investors interested in better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation – Airline industry can consider United Airlines (UAL) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW). United Airlines presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while SkyWest carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesUnited Airlines has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. UAL delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.44%, on average.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL’s current-year earnings has improved 18.9% over the past 90 days. Shares of UAL have soared 34.5% year to date.SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable.A fall in operating expenses is a tailwind for SkyWest. In second-quarter 2023, the metric dipped 2.4% to $693.8 million due to a decline in operating costs. Low operating expenses boost bottom-line results. Shares of SKYW have surged 144.6% year to date.SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 31.51%, on average.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

105,91c7605d-d655-3b14-8444-587e6c0fcf57,PM,2023-08-24,Kaival Brands: Positioning for the Future,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kaival-brands-positioning-future-130000335.html,1692795600,STORY,"['KAVL', 'PM']","[Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc.FDA Scientific Review Update, Patent Portfolio Acquisition, International RoyaltiesGRANT-VALKARIA, Fla., Aug. 23, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: KAVL) (""Kaival Brands,"" the ""Company"" or ""we,” “our” or similar terms), today announced a general business outlook update. The Company has been actively maintaining an outlook of positive change as it seeks to grow in a diversified way.UNPRECEDENTED EARLY GROWTHIn less than 12 months of initial operations, Kaival Brands achieved over $100 million in gross revenues through distribution of the BIDI® Stick. Since then, the Company has continued to navigate significant regulatory turbulence within the domestic United States ENDS market. To augment our core offering, the Company has continued to pursue pathways for diversification.Regulatory Hurdles:1Bidi Vapor submitted PMTAs for all 11 flavor varieties (9 flavored ENDS plus Menthol and Tobacco) of its BIDI® Stick prior to the court-ordered September 9, 2020, PMTA deadline, despite considerable business and logistical challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The detailed applications ran over 285,000 pages and contained significant information supporting the products as appropriate for the protection of the public health – including robust and reliable scientific data supporting that its flavored BIDI® Sticks provide an added benefit to adult smokers over tobacco-flavored ENDS. Despite submitting scientifically rigorous PMTAs and keeping the FDA informed about its ongoing clinical and behavioral studies, among other things, Bidi Vapor received a marketing denial order (""MDO”) for its flavored BIDI® Sticks, along with nearly all other manufacturers of flavored ENDS, in early September 2021. On September 29, 2021, Bidi Vapor subsequently filed a Petition for Review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking judicial review of the MDO under the Tobacco Control Act (""TCA""), the Administrative Procedure Act (""APA""), as well as the U.S. Constitution. On February 1, 2022, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit granted a judicial stay of the marketing denial order (""MDO"") previously issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") to Bidi Vapor in September 2021.The stay ruling allowed Bidi Vapor and Kaival Brands to continue to market and sell all of its BIDI® Stick ENDS, including its tobacco, menthol and flavored products, while the case on the merits continued. Following the judicial stay of the MDO issued in February 2022, on August 23, 2022, the 11th Circuit granted Bidi Vapor’s petition for review and set aside and remanded the MDO, which the Court held was arbitrary and capricious because FDA failed to consider relevant evidence before it, specifically Bidi Vapor’s aggressive and comprehensive marketing and sales-access-restrictions plans.Despite the issuance of MDOs covering over 1.2 million flavored ENDS products, the FDA failed to adequately enforce the denials at the ground level. This lack of enforcement allowed the sale of illegal products to continue, accelerating the tailwinds created during the pandemic, where e-cigarette sales surged2, with the spike concentrated in disposable vapes after they took a back seat in federal enforcement actions.Story continuesMAXIMIZING THE GROWTH OF BIDI® STICKThe Company remains committed to maximizing the growth and distribution of its core offering, the BIDI® Stick. In June, the Company announced it has relaunched distribution of the BIDI® Stick in over 1,000 Circle K locations, with a 5,000-store ramp-up underway within the South Atlantic and Midwest regions3, and launched in over 900 Kwik Trip and Mapco locations nationwide, with a ramp-up to over 1,200 locations.4Capitalizing on the Tailwinds of Increased FDA EnforcementIn May 2023, the FDA launched a self-proclaimed “Inspection Blitz,” which underscores the agency’s unwavering commitment to addressing the issue facing America’s youth.5Both the Company and Bidi Vapor have remained steadfastly committed to compliance and youth-access prevention. That commitment, along with the renewed focus and commitment by retailers, will continue to help educate consumers and raise awareness about the importance of youth access prevention and buying legitimate, non-illicit products. As reiterated by Brian King, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), “all players in the supply chain—including retailers—have a role in keeping illegal e-cigarettes off the shelves.6”The Company is encouraged by the renewed momentum we are experiencing (subject as always to FDA enforcement discretion) with retailers like Circle K, Kwik Trip, and Mapco who champion compliance and youth-access prevention and recognize our ongoing efforts since last year to educate retailers and distributors of the business value of marketing BIDI® Stick versus non-compliant competition. Of course, the goal is to capitalize on this momentum in orders as we seek to increase our revenues during the remainder of 2023 and beyond.4Completed FDA Reviews of Market Dominant PMTAs Expected by December 20237The FDA has recently provided a timeline on anticipated reviews of covered PMTAs to be completed. Covered PMTAs are limited only to: 1) new tobacco products on the market by Aug. 8, 2016; 2) must have been filed by the Sept. 9, 2020; and 3) products sold under the brand names Vuse, Juul, NJOY, Logic, SMOK, Blu, Puff Bar or Suorin, or that reach 2% of total retail dollar sales as reported in the Total E-Cig Market and Players report or the Disposable E-Cig Market and Players report, as produced by Chicago-based NielsenIQ.BIDI® Stick: 1) was on the market prior to August 8, 2016; 2) PMTAs were filed by the September 9, 2020 deadline; and 3) has consistently been the number one disposable vape product for more than twenty-four months since 2021 and has consistently reached 2% of total retail dollar sales as reported in the Total E-Cig Market and Players report or the Disposable E-Cig Market and Players report, as produced by Chicago-based NielsenIQ.The FDA anticipates action on:52% of covered PMTAs by March 31;53% of covered PMTAs by June 30;55% of covered PMTAs by Sept. 30; and100% of covered PMTAs by Dec. 31.MILESTONE PATENT PORTOFOLIO ACQUISITIONGoFire Patent Portfolio AcquisitionAcquisition from GoFire includes 12 issued and 46 pending patents.8 The GoFire patent portfolio includes 12 existing and 46 pending with novel technologies across extrusion dose control, product preservation, tracking and tracing usage, multiple modalities (i.e., different methods of vaporizing) and child safety. The patents and patent applications cover territories including the United States, Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Organisation, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea. The portfolio also includes a proprietary mobile device software application that is used in conjunction with certain patents in the portfolio.The acquired patent portfolio includes the following:9Controlled Delivery- Patented Twist-to-Dose™ technology utilizes a micro-threaded piston that provides consistent and precise delivery of consumables. There is an audible “click” so the consumer knows exactly how much is inhaled with each use.MHRA Requirements- Technology is designed to meet all Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) requirements in the United Kingdom.Bluetooth Child Safety App and Mechanical Cartridge Protection- A dual lockout system including a child safety lockout via Bluetooth app and child safety measures built mechanically into the cartridge design to prevent accidental consumption by minors.Flavor Delivery and Experience to Last Puff- Patented technology eliminates the bad taste that is associated with oil and e-liquid degradation. The RefreshFlavor™ technology is designed in a novel way to keep the vaporized solution safely away from the heating chamber until the moment it is consumed.Leak Proof Design and Removal of Cutting Agents- Patented sealed reservoir prevents leaks from occurring. Ordinary cartridges rely on dangerous thinning agents and wicks to deliver the oil and e-liquid to the heating chamber. The Twist-to-Dose™ technology with micro-threaded piston system can directly extrude oil into the heating chamber decreasing carbonyl and analyte formation.Authentication System/Counterfeit Protection- The acquired patents also include novel cartridge/pod identification and authentication/counterfeit protection capabilities.Dry Puff Protection- Certain elements of the acquired technologies design mitigate “dry puffs” which can occur when the consumable reservoir in a vaping/inhalation device is depleted, allowing the coil or wick to burn dry and emit potentially harmful toxins.510 and Pod Compatibility- The technology included in the acquired patents is compatible with both the universal 510 thread format as well as pod-based systems, the dominant formats of vaporizer and inhalation technologies.Product Remaining Indicators- The acquired technology provides indicators allowing for consumer insight into remaining product supply.EXPLORING NEW REVENUE STREAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES:Potential Revenue Opportunities with Recently Acquired Patent PortfolioThe Company is also pursuing capital-efficient opportunities to accelerate the potential monetization of its recently acquired patent portfolio. We are actively seeking third-party licensing opportunities in the cannabis, hemp/CBD, nicotine and nutraceutical markets. Longer term, we believe we can utilize the acquired patents to create innovative and market-disruptive products for its growing base of adult consumers, including patent protected vaporizer devices and related hardware and software applications.9Ongoing Consideration of Further M&amp;A OpportunitiesWe continue to remain open to, and exploring, opportunities to acquire new products and technologies that can be monetized utilizing our existing network and manufacturing capabilities.We are actively seeking to expand our portfolio through acquiring controlling interest in or exclusively distributing innovative and profitable products and growing them into dominant brands for their respective share markets.PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT &amp; EXPECTED ROYALTIES10Amended Agreement with Philip Morris InternationalOn August 17th, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kaival Brands International (“KBI”) entered into an amended agreement with Philip Morris Products S.A. (“PMPSA”), a wholly owned affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) (NYSE: PM), for the development and distribution of electronic nicotine delivery system (“ENDS”) products in markets outside of the U.S.Under the terms of the amended agreement, the parties agreed to revise certain terms, which provide for, among other things, a fixed pricing structure with volume-driven increases and a recapture of non-recurring engineering costs by KBI. Accordingly, the Company expects a reconciliation payment of approximately $135,000, which brings the total amount of royalties earned by the Company since July 2022 to over $400,000.Expected RoyaltiesFurthermore, the Company projects approximately $300,000 in additional royalties to be earned through the end of 2023, with an anticipated increasing trajectory of royalty income.Eric Mosser, Chief Executive Officer of Kaival Brands, stated, ""We are extremely pleased to reach an agreement that shall enable us to achieve cost savings of approximately $2.7 million for the Company over the lifetime of the license agreement. It also enables better predictability and forecasting for KBI and streamlines data reporting. We anticipate that the acceleration of royalty payments will be a net positive to our financial performance over the duration of the agreement.

112,77f87fda-94b0-3628-a4a3-4d7ba01e3281,PPG,2023-08-24,Here's Why You Should Hold Onto Eastman Chemical (EMN) for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-onto-eastman-114300358.html,1692790980,STORY,"['EMN', 'PPG']","[Eastman Chemical Company EMN is gaining from cost-cutting and productivity actions as well as its innovation-driven growth model amid certain headwinds including soft demand and consumer de-stocking.Shares of this leading chemical maker are down 15% over the past year compared with the 0.4% rise of its industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment. Cost Actions and Innovation Aid EMNEastman is benefiting from its actions to manage costs. The company is expected to benefit from lower operating costs from its operational transformation program. EMN was able to offset $1.3 billion in inflation from higher raw material, energy and distribution costs through price increases in 2022. It is on track to reduce manufacturing, supply chain and non-manufacturing costs by more than $200 million for 2023, net of inflation. Pricing initiatives and lower raw material and energy costs are also expected to support the company’s bottom line.The company should also gain from its strategic acquisitions. The growth initiatives have been greatly expedited by the acquisition of Solutia, which has provided excellent growth potential in the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, the buyout of BP Plc’s aviation turbine engine oil business has enabled Eastman to better serve the needs of the global aviation industry.The acquisition of PremiumShield has strengthened company’s automotive base in North America, Europe and the Middle East and boosted its paint protection film pattern development capabilities. The acquisition of AiRed Technology (Dalian) Co., Ltd. will also boost growth in the paint protection films market.Moreover, Eastman's goal is to increase new business revenues by utilizing its innovation-driven growth strategy. Due to the company's competence in specialty products, it generated around $550 million in new business revenues from innovation in 2022. Sales volumes are expected to be supported, in 2023, by the innovation and market development initiatives.Eastman Chemical also remains focused on maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Its operating cash flow increased to $410 million in the second quarter of 2023 from $245 million in the year-ago quarter. The company returned $144 million to shareholders in the second quarter of 2023 through dividends and share repurchases. Furthermore, it expects to deliver $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in 2023.Story continuesWeak Demand, De-stocking AilLingering effects from customer inventory de-stocking are expected to adversely impact Eastman Chemical’s performance in the second half of 2023. The company saw soft demand and consumer de-stocking for its consumer durables, building &amp; construction, consumables and agriculture end markets in the second quarter. The impacts of de-stocking are likely to be felt on the company’s volumes and top line in the third quarter.EMN has lowered its demand growth forecast and now expects primary demand in several of its end markets to be stable compared with the first half. It also expects consumer de-stocking to persist. The company anticipates that adjusted EPS in the second half of 2023 will be lower than the first half.Higher pension costs and lower capacity utilization are also expected to hurt company’s bottom line in 2023. EMN estimates pension and other post-employment benefits headwind of around $110 million for 2023. The company also sees a headwind of roughly $75 million due to lower asset utilization to reduce inventory in 2023. Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus Eastman Chemical Company Price and ConsensusEastman Chemical Company price-consensus-chart | Eastman Chemical Company Quote Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, Hawkins, Inc.

Limitless is subdued, refined and relaxing, reflecting a movement in consumer preferences toward warmer, less intense colors for everything from automobiles to architectural features.Along with this distinctive shade, PPG's global color specialists selected a color palette of more than 40 complementary hues split into three distinct color palettes. The first has gentle, grounded colors; the second has earthy greens, flowers and energizing blues; and the third has a lovely mix of vibrant and dramatic colors.When mixed with colors from these palettes, Limitless appears extremely warm and soothing yet simultaneously looks highly curated and elegant. Limitless uses an array of warm and cool tones, including shaded whites, delicate pastels, earthy neutrals, softened jewel tones and bold, bright hues. The color also fits trendy black and brass metal tones, as well as silver and bronze finishes.PPG's color forecasting is a detailed procedure that covers a variety of end-use segments and geographical areas. The PPG color styling team examined the social, cultural and political variables affecting global trends to develop the 2024 collection.Shares of PPG have gained 8.1% over the past year compared with 19.6% rise of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company expects adjusted EPS for the third quarter in the range of $1.85-$1.95. For the full year, the company raised its adjusted EPS projection to the range of $7.28-$7.48. These projections consider various factors such as current global economic activity, soft global industrial production, continued economic uncertainty associated with geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries.The company expects performance coatings demand in Europe to stabilize at lower levels than the pre-conflict period in Ukraine while raw material and transportation normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels.For Industrial coatings, PPG anticipates a low single-digit percentage decline in organic sales due to lower global industrial production, except for modest growth in China. Other industrial end-use markets are expected to be soft. However, selling price increases are expected to continue.Story continuesPPG Industries, Inc.

The lawsuit began in Aug. 2017.Spokespeople for Bank of America and UBS declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Stability Oversight Council has estimated that $3.1 trillion of securities were on loan worldwide as of Sept. 2021.EquiLend's governance changes include new restrictions on how board members share information, and limits on how many board seats each bank can hold.They also include a requirement that the board's outside antitrust lawyers be ""rotated"" every three years, to avoid what the investors call the ""capture"" of those lawyers.The case is Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System et al v Bank of America Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-06221.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

We believe that AI could be a profound disrupter not only of our industry, but all digital and all information and knowledge industries in general,” he told Yahoo Finance Live.This has been a growing refrain from executives outside of technology. Wendy’s is using an AI chatbot in its drive-thrus. Cosmetics and skin care company Oddity, which became public this month, uses AI to develop new products and to match consumers with makeup. And other big financial firms are no stranger to AI – Bank of America is reportedly using it, and virtual reality, to help train new employees.Goldman’s Argenti is a tech veteran, coming to the storied investment house after stints at Amazon Web Services and Nokia. He’s trying to bring an engineer’s philosophy to the bank, urging his developers to work with customers on what solutions they need and why.“Engineers’ roles have changed, and today it’s a mix between data science, traditional development, and business that come together in this powerful combination that I think really drives the strategic agenda of any firm,” he said.So how are those engineers using AI? Argenti said he sees it as a sort of translator between coders and computers, to boost engineering productivity.He also posited a situation where large language models could be used to summarize relevant news and deliver it to a banker, along with which clients might be impacted and talking points for conversations with them.“I think we’re actually not that far away from that,” he said. “Right now, the challenge, really — and for us it’s been a big focus — is how to make it safe” and to make sure the information being shared is accurate and credible.Story continuesIf and when the Nvidia hype cycle fervor has faded, companies like Goldman and countless others outside of tech will still be working on how to incorporate generative AI into their businesses. That’s in part because the role of tech in other industries has changed.“Technology’s no longer the back-office, IT organization. Technology is actually the driver of a lot of competitive advantage and actually is the driver of the strategic agenda of the firm in many cases.”Julie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9am-11am ET.

GS is planning to sell a part of its wealth management business. Per a Reuters article, the company is scaling back its ambitions to serve the mass consumers and deciding to focus on serving the ultra-rich.GS stated that it was evaluating alternatives for its registered investment adviser (RIA) unit, named Personal Financial Management (PFM).Goldman had acquired the RIA unit which was formerly known as United Capital Financial Partners, Inc. in an all-cash deal valued at $750 million in May, 2019. At the time of acquisition, United Capital had $25 billion of assets under management and over 220 financial advisors. The transaction was aimed at broadening its clientele beyond the ultra-rich and expanding its geographic footprint.PFM is a very small component of the firm’s overall wealth management business. The unit has contributed little to the overall growth of GS’ business.Besides this restructuring move, Goldman has been looking for bidders for the sale of its consumer lending platform, GreenSky. GS has been refocusing its business on its core strengths of investment banking and trading, while reducing its retail footprint. These major business restructuring initiatives are in sync with the strategic overhaul.Once the proposed plan is fulfilled, Goldman would be focusing on its ultra-high-net-worth clients and growth of its core wealth business.

And he says what’s coming just days from now is going to shock the world again.Last night at 8pm ET, Eric revealed the full details so you can prepare before the panic begins. He also shared his blueprint for turning the panic into 1,000% profit potential.Click here to watch the replay now.A Huge Stride in InnovationTo create its first Barbie in 1959, Mattel Inc. (MAT) utilized a revolutionary type of plastic called vinyl PVC.Throughout the 1950s, versions of this “miracle material” had been circulating in various industrial applications, but Mattel was one of the first companies to apply this new technology to the toy industry.Mattel combined PVC with phthalate-based “plasticizers” that improved the flexibility and durability of plastic, which made Barbie’s “skin” more human-like. This original Barbie “formula” has evolved over the years to become a creation that contains more chemicals than most junk food.But the foundational concept has never changed: to produce a pliable, durable doll out of plastic. That simple formula created a worldwide franchise that has sold more than one billion Barbie dolls since 1959 and that continues to generate more than $1 billion per year in sales.Story continuesIn other words, by applying a new technology in a novel way, the Mattel company created a wealth-generating empire.Today, many companies are attempting a similar feat with artificial intelligence (AI).They are attempting to adopt and apply this new technology in ways that will supercharge their growth trajectories, and perhaps build wealth-generating empires of their own.Mattel was not the very first company to introduce a plastic toy. Two years before Barbie landed on toy store shelves in 1959, Wham-O introduced the plastic “Frisbee” and “Hula-Hoop.” The following year, Sweden’s Lego company began selling its famous plastic building blocks in the United States.But Mattel’s plastic toy was different. Barbie was not rigid like a Frisbee or a Lego block; she was a supple, pliable plastic toy. In other words, Mattel applied a new technology in a novel way.Behind the ScenesNow, technology inventers rarely leave multimillion-dollar, or multibillion-dollar, estates to their heirs.Technology appliers, however, often do. For example…Cornelius Vanderbilt didn’t invent the railroad… and neither did Collis Huntington. But both of these “railroad men” left behind billion-dollar fortunes in today’s dollars.Henry Ford didn’t invent the internal combustion engine.Charlie Chaplin didn’t invent the motion picture.Oprah Winfrey didn’t invent television or even the talk show.Bill Gates didn’t invent the personal computer.And of course, Jeff Bezos didn’t invent the Internet.Show me a technological empire, and I’ll show you someone who creatively applied a breakthrough technology – or who integrated a breakthrough technology with existing ones. And they’re almost never the people who actually invent these things.Technology is simply a tool, until somebody figures out a novel way to use it… just like Mattel’s Barbie dolls. Artificial intelligence is merely the newest tool in the technology tool kit.It is a pretty cool tool, but it is just a tool until somebody does something amazing with it.In the right hands, this technology could become transformational. Those are the hands I want to find as an investor.I want to find the companies that are completely transforming themselves by doing what others are not – by adopting and applying AI to their processes in significant, if not transformational, ways.I believe I’ve found the tip of the iceberg on these exact sort of plays – so much so that I gave one of my top picks in this space away for free last night at The Coming $3 Trillion AI Panic event.And if you missed last night’s event, not to worry. You can catch a replay here.And you’ll want to do it soon because during this event, I go over…What this AI panic means for you…If we’ve seen anything remotely like this before…And what you can do about it.Watch the replay now – it won’t be available for much longer.Sincerely,Eric Fry's signatureEric FryEditor, Smart MoneyEric Fry is an award-winning stock picker with numerous “10-bagger” calls — in good markets AND bad.

(PKG) Down 5% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-packaging-corp-pkg-down-153017817.html,1692804617,STORY,['PKG'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Packaging Corp. (PKG). Shares have lost about 5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Packaging Corp. due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Packaging Corp Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates on Low VolumesPackaging Corporation of America reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.31 in the second quarter of 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.95. The reported figure was higher than the company’s EPS guidance of $1.96 in the quarter under review. However, the bottom line decreased 28% year over year.The downside was primarily caused by lower volumes in the Packaging and Paper segments. Lower price and mix in the Packaging segment combined with higher depreciation expense and other converting costs were major headwinds. Nonetheless, lower operating costs, higher prices and mix in the Paper segment, a lower share count and reduced scheduled maintenance outage expenses, and a lower tax rate offset some of these negatives.Including one-time items, earnings in the reported quarter were $2.24 per share compared with the prior-year quarter’s $3.20.Operational UpdateSales in the second quarter fell 12.7% year over year to $1,952 million. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,980 million.Cost of products sold was down 8.6% year over year to $1,507 million in the reported quarter. Gross profit fell 24.5% year over year to $444.7 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $146 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s $157 million. Adjusted operating income slumped 30% year over year to $146 million.Segment PerformancesPackaging: Sales in this segment decreased 13.4% year over year to $1,790 million in the second quarter of 2023. The figure lagged our estimate of $1,794 million.In the Packaging segment, total corrugated products shipments and shipments per day fell 9.8% year over year. We had anticipated a volume decline of 7%, and an unfavorable price and mix impact of 6.3%.Adjusted operating profit was $286 million compared with $420 million in the prior-year quarter. the metric plunged 32% year over year. Per our model, the estimated segmental adjusted operating income was $251 million, that had factored in a fall of 40.1% from the year-earlier reported figure.Paper: The segment’s revenues were $143 million in the Apr-June quarter, down 4.7% year over year. It missed our estimate of $146 million. The segment reported an adjusted operating profit of $29 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s $23 million. Our projection for the segment’s adjusted operating income was $24.2 million.Segmental sales volume was down 19,000 tons compared with second-quarter 2022 levels. We had expected a positive pricing/mix impact of 9.4% in the second quarter. Volume was expected to be a negative 11.7%.Story continuesCash PositionPackaging Corp had a cash balance of $630 million at second-quarter 2023 end, down from $811 million at the end of the prior-year quarter.OutlookPackaging Corp projects third-quarter 2023 EPS to be $1.88. Shipments per day is anticipated to improve sequentially despite one less shipping day for the corrugated business. Pricing is, however, likely to fall as a result of previously announced domestic containerboard price decreases and lower export pricing.In the Paper segment, volumes are expected to pick up, aided by back-to-school shipments. Prices are suggested to trend lower based on the recent declines in index prices.Operating and converting costs are anticipated to be slightly higher primarily due to elevated recycled fiber prices and seasonal energy cost. Scheduled maintenance planned at International Falls, MN mill is expected to hurt earnings. Due to all of these factors along with higher tax rate the third-quarter EPS projection hints a year-over-year decline of 33.6%How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision flatlined during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Packaging Corp. has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookPackaging Corp. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares rise as the company beat on adjusted earnings in its second quarter and raised its full-year operating margin forecast. Netflix (NFLX) shares rise after seeing a 2.6 million subscriber increase in July, according to Antenna. Oppenheimer also reaffirmed its ""outperform"" rating on the stock. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the trending tickers of the day.Video Transcript- Foot Locker shares sinking into the red, closing off 28%. The company's slashing its annual guidance for the second time. Foot Locker also announcing it will suspend its cash dividends beyond a recently approved payout slated for October.The bad news keeps piling up here Diane for Foot Locker, a very, very challenging quarter, challenging couple of quarters possibly ahead, theft markdowns hurting profits, sales falling nearly 10%, pausing their cash dividend. I think investors are really questioning what it's going to take to turn around this business good.- It's a good question. I mean, we've seen-- we saw Foot Locker previously guide lower for their expectations for sales, for comps, and now expecting even bigger, pardon the pun, shoe to drop there. Sorry, I couldn't-- it just came out. I mean, they've slashed their full year outlook for earnings down to a range of about 30 to about 50. They previously guided for between 2 and 2.25, two and quarter there.So just the call outs also about the price sensitive consumer, Foot Locker CEO, Mary Dillon, saying that in the company's earnings release, I mean, and just again the worries about the consumer and discretionary dollars and where they're spending them.And right now, Foot Locker, feeling the effect of people choosing to spend their dollars on still on experiences and they still haven't seen a strength with back to school season, like some retailers have seen some strength there, but some, again, all the retailers in general that we've seen have talked about worries, about the consumer. Some are managing to avert those issues, but Foot Locker, not doing so well here.Story continuesAll right. Another stock we're looking at Williams-Sonoma out with an earnings beat. The company also raises its operating margin outlook for the year, the stock finishing up more than 13%, about 13.5% on the day. This boosted margin guidance offsetting the company's reduction in its revenue outlook.So, you know, I mean, its margins look good. They were stronger than what was expected. They may have had some sales declines, but you know Williams-Sonona held up, if people don't remember some of their brands. They also owned Pottery Barn, I think West Elm is in their belt too. So it looks like management has done well in terms of managing their margins, Seana.- Yeah, they've done OK. It's certainly a challenging time here for Williams-Sonoma. You take into account some of their brand names that you were just mentioning there. West Elm there. There was weakness during the quarter sales off 20.8%. That was much more than the street was looking for or expecting. They were expecting a drop of 13%, also Pottery Barn.Comp sales there declining over 10%. The estimate was for a drop of just about 5%. So yes. The focus here. And the reason why we're seeing gains during the day today was because the fact that it did boost its full year operating margin forecast. That was enough to excite the street, especially since investors were bracing for a cut.But it is still a very challenging couple of months likely ahead for Williams-Sonoma and also a number of the names within that sector, and buried out saying that they do have a strong balance sheet, which does provide capital allocation optionality? So it enables them to weather what's likely going to be a tough couple of months, but still consumers pulling back on discretionary spending-- we've seen that pretty much across the board from the retailers. It's going to set up some of these retailers to have a tough couple of months .- Yeah.- All right. Let's take a look at Netflix getting a boost after data from research firm Antenna showing that US subscriber additions in July remaining high, this coming after an initial surge in subscribers following the start of the password sharing crackdown back in May. We're looking at gains of just about 3.5%.The fourth day in a row that we've seen Netflix close the day higher Oppenheimer, reaffirming its outperform rating on the stock $515 price target. They call it two tailwinds here, pay cheering and also advertising initiatives. Those two initiatives, they see boosting revenue by 40% for the fiscal year 2023, compared to what we saw back in 2022.- Yeah, it's really interesting to see that just the expectation and Netflix doing better than expected in terms of the implementation of that password crackdown, not seeing the churn that we've saw-- that we expected one, and not seeing just general churn in terms of streamers. I mean, Netflix continues to be the leader in that respect, even if you think back to once upon a time, they had that quote ""love is sharing a password."" Apparently it's not now.But again, you know, Oppenheimer pointing out just that they expect to see this revenue increase, and that the drivers are being underappreciated by investors, today definitely being appreciated by investors in terms of where the share price is right now. Yep, up just about 3 and 1/2 percent.]"

The offer included wage increases and AI protections, but the deal was denied by the WGA. Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down what else the offer entailed.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Hollywood studios is releasing the details of their latest offer to screenwriters in a bid to end the ongoing strike. The new offer, well, it includes higher pay and protections against AI. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the latest details for us. Allie, are we getting any closer to a deal?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, it's an interesting tactic by the studios to release this proposal publicly. They're doing this to put some pressure on the Guild, which actually denied the proposal in a meeting late last night. The two sides meeting face to face for the first time in a long time.We had some pretty prominent executives there like Disney CEO Bob Iger, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, WBD CEO David Zaslav. But the Guild slammed the meet up in a follow-up email to members saying, quote, ""This wasn't a meeting to make a deal. This was a meeting to get us to cave.So some pretty fighting words there. They essentially said that this deal didn't even come close to addressing all of their concerns. They still want a mandatory number of writers to be staffed on every shown in addition to bonuses based on how popular a show is on a streaming service. But this is-- what you're seeing on your screen now is what the studios did offer.And from their perspective, they believe that they really hit all the main points that the writers were asking for. We see a higher compensation, increases to streaming residuals, further protections around AI, a guaranteed minimum length of employment, and more transparency around viewership data so writers can actually understand the popularity of their work.And just to get even more specific here, the studios said the proposed wage increase would be a compounded 13% jump over the three-year contract. And that would actually be the highest increase for the WGA in 13 years. And then on the streaming residual side, that would jump by 22%.Story continuesSo they think they came up with a fair deal. Writers say no. It's a lose-lose situation. That's what I'm hearing from analysts right now. I mean, writers are out of work. You know, they have livelihoods that are just on hold right now. And then on the studio side, they're strapped for cash.They're bleeding money. Streaming profitability is still a major issue. And we're going to eventually hit a point where we're going to run out of content. So at some point, some people are even predicting in 2024. So it could go on for that long.- Wow, that would be long.ALEXANDRA CANAL: The pain on both sides is just going to be too much. So it's just how long can both sides hold out here?- That's a good question. And apparently, the writers are also asking for a cut of the rewards when it comes to revenue. Could this be a sticking point, especially as analysts predict Netflix is about to have a huge cash injection?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I mean, Netflix is doing really well with some of their revenue initiatives like the crackdown on password sharing, the ad-supported tier. I do think that's going to be a sticking point. They want a cut. If a show is doing really well on a streaming service. And bringing in subscribers, the writers are saying they deserve some-- a piece, at least, of that pie.But again, the streamers are really hesitant to set a precedent here, the studios are, because if they sign something, if they commit to giving a cut to the writers and then they're not able to make money in the end, that's going to be an issue. So it's not just coming up with a contract for today. It's thinking about where the industry is going to be in the next 5, 10 years.I mean, the last writers strike in 2007, no one would have ever predicted the explosion of streaming that we're seeing today. So it's a really challenging environment to try and think of a deal and come up with a way that both sides can sort of reach this compromise.

It is calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it indicates overvaluation and potential poor future returns. Conversely, if it is significantly below, it suggests undervaluation and potentially high future returns.Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) appears to be fairly valued according to the GF Value. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Is Phillips 66 (PSX) Stock Fairly Valued?Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can lead to a high risk of permanent capital loss.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:The overall earnings picture remains stable and resilient, with the outlook actually starting to improve over the last few months. The revisions trend has notably stabilized lately, with estimates for several key sectors increasing.This evolving earnings outlook remains inconsistent with the long-feared ‘earnings cliff’ narrative.For the 480 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, total earnings are down -8.5% from the same period last year on +0.8% higher revenues, with 79.4% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates.For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -2.0% on +0.5% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.4% on +3.2% higher revenues.The somewhat mixed showing from the traditional retailers in their Q2 earnings reports was primarily due to management execution and less a function of any significant moderation in consumer spending.We discussed Target TGT last week, which missed top-line and comp estimates but did better on margins and inventories. We noted that while management appeared satisfied with current inventory levels, investors will be justified in wondering whether Target has really addressed the issue if Q2’s weak sales and traffic trends will result in unsold inventory in the coming periods.Story continuesUnlike Walmart WMT, whose quarterly report showed all-around strength, Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Walmart stumbled last year following its Q1 report, as did Target, but it recovered quickly. In its Q2 report, Walmart benefited from broad market share gains and momentum in key growth initiatives.While Walmart has a much bigger grocery business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise, demand for which has moderated in the post-Covid period. That said, Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 96% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.2023 Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -2.0%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.The long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either.These growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management’s guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Free Report: Top EV Battery Stocks to Buy NowJust-released report reveals 5 stocks to profit as millions of EV batteries are made.

Conversely, the company’s bottom line managed to surpass the consensus estimate but experienced a year-over-year decrease. While BJ’s Wholesale Club achieved growth in comparable club sales, excluding gasoline sales' impact, it revised full-year expectations for the metric, citing a shift in consumer behavior due to the macroeconomic environment.Q2 InsightsBJ’s Wholesale Club reported adjusted earnings of 97 cents a share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents.

""So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.""A similar warning came this month from the world's largest retailer, Walmart.""Jobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers. But rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs and tightening lending standards, and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told Wall Street when the retailer reported earnings.Federal student loans will begin to accrue interest again on Sept. 1, with payments resuming on Oct. 1.Read more: Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could helpTransUnion's head of global research and consulting Charlie Wise tells Yahoo Finance that roughly 40 million consumers will face the ""payment shock"" when student debt relief ends.A man carries flowers and balloons during Los Angeles Mission College's 48th annual commencement ceremony on June 6, 2023. (Hans Gutknecht/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images via Getty Images)Consumers were already having trouble paying off credit card debt, as Macy's warned this week. Now, the return of student loan payments could make financial matters worse, with execs warning that the extra expense may lead consumers to pull back spending in other areas.Yahoo Finance takes a look at the consumer stocks with the most at risk.Retailers with most student loan payment exposureSome retailers appear more vulnerable to repayment shock than others heading into the crucial back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.Story continues""We are most cautious on brands with high exposure to student debt holders and inferior value perceptions amongst 18-34-year-olds, the most representative demographic of student debt holders,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients.The research team at TD Cowen highlighted Target (TGT) and Ulta (ULTA) as particularly vulnerable, due to their exposure to younger, low-income consumers with student loans.""The resumption of student loan repayments is one of many factors that we're watching really closely,"" Target CFO Michael Fiddelke told Yahoo Finance as the retailer slashed its full-year profit outlook.Other ""most-exposed"" stocks to younger, lower-income student borrowers, according to TD Cowen analysts, include Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), FIGS (FIGS), Foot Locker (FL), Burlington Stores (BURL), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote that US student debt borrowers will likely pull back spending on apparel overall since they ""prefer brands over private label and specialty retailers over discounters.""This is bad news for American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Carter's (CRI), Crocs (CROX), Canada Goose (GOOS), The Gap (GPS), Nordstrom (JWN), Nike (NKE), Steven Madden (SHOO), Under Armour (UAA), and Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. (VSCO), Sole said.Stores with a higher discretionary product mix also face higher risk, according to JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers.That includes Target and Ulta, Horvers noted, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Best Buy (BBY), followed by Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Costco (COST), and Walmart, with the primary difference driven by the former group's higher mix of discretionary product.On the flip side, auto parts stocks are less at risk ""given their lower-income exposure and low discretionary mix,"" Horvers wrote in a note to investors.Meanwhile, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) ""remains a question mark"" as its ""geo-weighted exposure to student loans ranks it high offset by its largely non-discretionary mix (85% grocery),"" Horvers added.Restaurants watch for sales weaknessWhen it comes to spending at restaurants, TD Cowen's Charles said he estimates up to ""a 2% annual headwind to restaurant industry spending as student loan payments resume.""The team at TD Cowen suggested Jack in the Box (JACK), Dutch Bros (BROS), and Sweetgreen (SG) may face headwinds. Investors should also tread lightly with tobacco and beverage brands, such as Altria Group (MO), British American Tobacco (BATS), and Monster Beverage (MNST).Even higher-end plays in the restaurant space aren't immune.Cava — where a salad bowl can set one back $14 — expressed caution on the consumer outlook in its latest earnings.CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance that student loan payments restarting was one of the ""multitude of factors"" up against consumers, along with higher gas prices, costly utility bills, and a ""hawkish Fed.""""So we're mindful of those pressures,"" Schulman said. ""We saw a resilient consumer in Q2, but we'd be remiss if we didn't take those considerations into account.""Of course, not all borrowers will have to pay right away.Those still in school remain ""in the regular forbearance period,"" TransUnion's Wise points out. ""But we think that about 26 million-27 million consumers will be facing the beginning or resumption of payments in the next couple of weeks.""There's another catch: The Department of Education is instituting a 12-month ""on-ramp"" for repayment from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024. Though interest will accrue during this period, financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments won't be considered delinquent or reported to credit bureaus and debt collectors.Cowen's Charles said in a note to clients this ""likely pushes any major impact to spending to late next year.""Are you an American with student loan debt or a company nervous about the return of student loan payments?

I'm going to begin today's call with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion on the macro environment and how that is informing our approach to the remainder of the year. Tony will then give an update on our five growth vectors and the merchandising strategy. From there, Adrian will provide additional detail on the second quarter and our third quarter and full year outlooks. He will also discuss opportunities under his expanded role as COO. Before we dig into the results, I want to acknowledge the devastating wildfires on Maui. We have accounted for all our colleagues on the island, but a few have been directly impacted by the destruction and loss caused by the wildfires.We're supporting those colleagues via our North Star Relief Fund and are engaged with the American Red Cross through our annual financial commitment and customer roundup campaigns across our Hawaii and Guam stores to support Maui residents. Turning to second quarter results. We achieved net sales of $5.13 billion, a gross margin rate of 38.1%, and an SG&amp;A rate of 37.5%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.26 primarily benefited from better-than-expected sales, gross margin and SG&amp;A. These factors more than offset lower-than-anticipated credit card revenues and a timing shift in the recognition of shortage. Taking a step back, we exited the first quarter with excess spring seasonal receipts at Macy's due to lower-than-anticipated demand trends in the back half of the quarter.On our earnings call, we committed to entering fall in a clean inventory position. Ultimately, we ended the second quarter with inventories down 10% to last year and down 18% to 2019. We were disciplined with our approach to inventory commitments and flex the cadence and depth of promotions and markdowns, utilizing our data-driven tools to reduce the length of seasonal clearance activity by several weeks. Promotional sell-throughs were better than expected and clearance markdowns were not as deep. Thanks to our cross-functional teams for being nimble, flexible and embracing new ways of working. Entering the third quarter, store floors and online are less cluttered and easier to navigate. Content is fresh and seasonally appropriate with open to buy and the ability to chase into areas of strength, all of which improves the omnichannel shopping experience.At Macy's, net sales declined 9.3% and comparable sales declined 8.2% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Aged inventories were roughly 20% below last year's levels and warm weather inventories were about 40% lower. Top performing categories include beauty, particularly fragrances and prestige cosmetics, women's career sportswear, and men's tailored clothing. We also continued to realize improvements in the soft home categories, including textiles and housewares. Active, casual and sleepwear remain challenged. We are working on solutions to improve trends in these categories. In the near term, active should benefit from the reintroduction of Nike men's, women's and kids' online and in 75 doors in October and the rollout to more than 200 doors this spring.This morning, we are also pleased to announce that select Under Armour men's product will be available in 150 stores and online, beginning in February. The return of Nike and Under Armour speaks to the strength and reach of Macy's and our ability to attract sought-after wholesale partners. Looking ahead, we're working with both brands as well as potential new partners on how to expand further. Comparable owned sales for store-within-stores in our Macy's off-price concept, Backstage, outperformed Macy's full-line stores in which they operate by roughly 260 basis points. At Bloomingdale's, net sales declined 3.6% and comparable sales were down 2.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Beauty, women's contemporary and designer apparel, and shoes were our best performing categories, while handbags, men's and dresses were challenged.Bloomingdale's focus remains on being the winning option for multi-branded upscale retail. During the quarter, we introduced Hoka, a leading active shoe brand that is highly relevant to our consumer, and it has been selling out. Bloomingdale's outlet outperformed full-line Bloomingdale's locations by about 800 basis points. Later this month, we will be opening our 21st outlet, which will be located in Christiana, Delaware. At Bluemercury, net sales rose 5.6% and comparable sales increased 5.8%. Customers continue to respond well to our skincare and color cosmetic brands. While second quarter results largely exceeded our expectations, they were promotional and markdown-driven, which makes it difficult to decipher any potential shifts in consumer health.As we plan the remainder of the year and we think about 2024, we remain cautious on the pressures impacting our customer, especially at Macy's, where roughly 50% of the identified customers have an average household income of $75,000 or under. Over the last several quarters, we have seen the Macy's customer more aggressively pull back on spend in our discretionary categories. They are not converting as easily and becoming more intentional on the allocation of their disposable income, with an ongoing shift to services and experiences. We cannot predict when macro pressures will ease and are focused on controlling what we can control. However, we believe our strong balance sheet, continued disciplined approach to inventories, and fortification of fundamentals position us well.Today, we're reading and reacting to shifting consumer preferences in real time. We have remixed category and brand level receipts, pulled back on what's not working, and chased into areas of strength. As we look to the remainder of the year, we are confident in the thoughtful and strategic promotional calendar and offerings we have planned, and our ability to pivot to the right inventory at the right time and right value. We will continue to leverage our data science tools to refine inventory composition, breadth and depth on a weekly basis and to further streamline decision-making to efficiently find and execute compelling opportunities that had a positive impact, both near and longer term. At Macy's, for back to school, we have a compelling mix of relevant national brands, including Jordan Kids, Levi's and Ralph Lauren, and are also offering a better selection of everyday basics, including uniforms.For holiday, we are further amplifying our strength as a gift-giving destination. We have elevated the quality of our products. We have built strong value across our categories from top market to private brands. In beauty and gifting are a more significant piece of our fourth quarter strategy, accounting for over 40% of Macy's brand sales versus mid-30s during the rest of the year. We anticipate a strong holiday for toys and we will be offering a Disney 100th anniversary collaboration in-store and online. This is the start of a longer-term strategic partnership with Disney and Toys R Us that will have elevated differentiated products across categories, brought to life through engaging retail experiences. At Bloomingdale's, this holiday season, we are partnering with many of our luxury brands to introduce high touch, unique experiences, events, and pop-ups, curated around the interests and shopping patterns of our best customers.These activations have been designed to create animation and inspiration in our stores and strengthen our client relationships. And at Bluemercury, we have an expanded fragrance offering for holiday, and we will launch our newest proprietary brand, which is focused on body and bath products. We are excited for the back half in all the ways we will serve our customer. Adrian will discuss our full year guidance in detail shortly, but it is important to note that despite elevated headwinds for credit card revenue and asset sales relative to prior outlook, we are reiterating our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Before turning it over to Tony, I want to congratulate our teams on several milestones. At Macy's, we recently introduced our newest private brand, On 34th.Its target demographic is the 30 to 50-year-old woman on the go. Commentary has been very positive with, approximately 80% of product reviews receiving four stars or above. At Bloomingdale's, we soft-launched Marketplace in July. Customers have been discovering and responding well to the new categories and brands offer. And at Bluemercury, we moved our headquarters from Washington, DC to New York City. The team is energized by this important step in its growth trajectory, which places them in one of the major beauty centers of the world, brings cost efficiencies and allows them to further benefit from the existing infrastructure of Macy's, Inc. Looking ahead, we believe that our improving underlying fundamentals, five growth vectors, and elevated customer experience are key components to relevancy and success as a modern department store.With that, Tony is going to discuss our five growth vectors and his approach to merchandising.Tony Spring: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by recognizing our teams for their dedication and the innovative work they are leading. I have always believed that balance of tenured and newer colleagues working together brings the most thoughtful and fresh perspectives, and I see that coming to life across Macy's, Inc. organization. Last week, we announced the arrival of Max Magni, our Chief Customer and Digital Officer. Max has over 20 years of experience at McKinsey, most recently as a senior partner, co-leading their NextGen Commerce and Consumer Growth Practices. We're excited to have Max join us and look forward to his contributions. Over the last several years, Jeff and Adrian have improved the operational efficiencies and financial health of the company.This has been a key enabler of our transformation and the advancement of our five growth vectors. These factors are intertwined with the overarching strategy of keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Our first growth vector is Macy's private brand reimagination. As Jeff mentioned, we recently launched On 34th, which has been informed by direct consumer research. Results are encouraging, with sales exceeding expectations, and we believe On 34th has the potential to become one of our biggest private brands. Our team has been thoughtful in both the development and planned rollout of our updated private brand strategy. The reimagination work has been built on three key pillars. First, brand stewardship; second, design with intention and execute with attention; and third, provide a meaningful value equation.From sourcing to marketing to merchandising, the teams have worked together to reflect our customers' wants and needs. They have considered life stages to create products and brands that authentically resonate with and capture the hearts of current and prospective customers. With the reinvigoration of a proprietary portfolio, we expect to further drive customer loyalty by complementing our national brand matrix with differentiated products, which should ultimately benefit sales and gross margin. Through 2025, we will be refreshing or replacing all existing brands in our portfolio and plan to introduce four new ones, including On 34th. As part of our updated private brand strategy, last year, we successfully refreshed women's I.N.C. In the second quarter, momentum for this popular brand continued, as sales once again outperformed its broader apparel segment.In September, we'll be introducing the next phase of I.N.C.'s refresh. Our second growth vector is small store format. We are pleased with the performance of our 10 small-format locations, which include eight Macy's and two Bloomies. Macy's and Bloomies stores that have been opened over year had a positive comparable owned-plus-licensed sales growth. Last weekend, we opened our ninth small-format Macy's just outside Chicagoland area in Indiana. And in September, we'll open two more. One will be in Las Vegas and the other will be in Boston, which is our first smaller format in the Northeast. In November, we will open a location in San Diego. Bloomingdale's is also adding to its small-format portfolio, with plans to open a third location in November.The store will be located in Seattle, which is a new brick-and-mortar market for the brand. Our third growth vector is digital marketplace, which offers curated categories and brands that seamlessly integrate with the customer experience and have no inventory risk. At Macy's, we're approaching the one-year anniversary of our Marketplace launch. We now offer approximately 1,350 brands on the platform, up from 500 last fiscal year-end, and we grew gross merchandise value by over 116% from the first quarter. At Macy's Marketplace, we continue to see significant cross-shopping, higher average order value, and higher units per order. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we recently introduced Bloomingdale's Marketplace and are pleased with the early results.Our fourth growth vector is luxury, which spans Bloomingdale's, Bluemercury, and Macy's beauty. At Bloomingdale's, we continue to optimize our relationship with our customers and elevate our luxury shopping experience. On the trailing 12-month basis, our top-of-the-list loyalty customer base grew in both count and spend. We know this customer loves the Bloomingdale's shopping experience, and we have remodeled the Bloomingdale's doors with larger concentration of luxury brands and products. Improvements have focused on areas with higher luxury goods penetration, including beauty, fragrances, shoes, handbags, and fine jewelry. Thus far, we have remodeled five locations and believe there is opportunity for more. At our smallest nameplate, Bluemercury, we realized the 10th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth.Active customer count on a trailing 12-month basis rose 20%, driven primarily by new customers. Bluemercury's consistently strong performance is a testament to the work the team is doing to evolve the brand and product mix to stay ahead of trends and offer a more exclusive experience to the luxury skincare, and beauty customer. At Macy's beauty, we're expanding our luxury offering with an emphasis on newness, freshness in our core market brands, and in-store service. As we prepare for the holiday, we will lean into our leading fragrance positioning across our omnichannel shopping experiences and will introduce six additional beauty remodels, bringing the total to 39 locations. Our fifth growth vector is personalized offers and communications.It amplifies strategies across our business to increase customer lifetime value and loyalty by improving relevance of every interaction. Our digital and technology teams are in the early stages of implementing multi-step and multi-channel tests. We recently launched several new tools that will allow us to speak even more consistently to our customers across touchpoints, personalized conversations and increase the amount of behaviorally-driven marketing. I am confident that our five growth vectors should drive incremental sales growth beginning next year and I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. Before turning the call over to Adrian, I want to provide a few thoughts on our overarching merchandise strategy. Over the last several months, I've been spending time with the Macy's team discussing the right balance of private and market brands and the importance of curation.We are working together to combine their ideas and my experiences at Bloomingdale's. Currently, we are targeting two major opportunities. First, going after the right categories, brands, and products that excite our customers; and second, maximizing sales and market share opportunity in underpenetrated categories where customers have signaled demand. In addition, we're exploring how we can further establish ourselves as a compelling wholesale partner for current and potential top market brands. The upcoming additions of Nike and Under Armour are two great examples. We are a business committed to transforming, even in an environment that's unpredictable. Despite the macro conditions and challenges, we remain focused on satisfying our customers' desire to shop, off-price to luxury, digitally, on-mall or off-model, and from private brands to up-and-coming and established national brands.Within that framework, our multi-channel, multi-generational, and multi-category platform is an advantage to address changing demand. I have confidence in our strategy and the team's ability to execute, which sets us up for success even in this uncertain environment. With that, let me turn it over to Adrian.Adrian Mitchell: Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I want to start this morning by thanking my finance and real estate teams for their ongoing dedication and hard work. And to my colleagues in stores, technology, and supply chain, I am grateful to partner with you more closely. In our last call, I shared the three fundamental areas of opportunity that we identified to build a faster, more flexible and more efficient operating model. First, improving the end-to-end omnichannel shopping experience; second, optimizing our physical store footprint, while enhancing inventory flow, merchandise planning, and localized assortment capabilities; and third, further modernizing our supply chain and technology infrastructure. Over the last few months, I have continued to align with our teams on how to simplify our processes, while providing more consistent shopping experiences that engage and inspire our customers.I look forward to sharing more on this effort in the future. Now, let's talk through the second quarter performance for our five value creation levers. First, omnichannel sales. Net sales of $5.13 billion declined 8.4% versus the prior year, slightly above the high end of our outlook. Comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis decreased 7.3%. Owned AUR rose 4.7%, driven by ticket increases and category mix. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued AUR improvement on ticket increases, lower markdowns and category mix. Other revenue of $150 million were 2.9% of net sales. Macy's Media Network revenue was flat to last year at $30 million. Our long-term confidence in Macy's Media Network is tempered by near-term caution in light of broader industry trends.During the quarter, credit card revenues declined 130 basis points or $84 million year-over-year to $120 million and represented 2.3% of net sales. We experienced an increased rate of delinquencies within the credit card portfolio across all stages of aged balances. While we had expected delinquencies to rise as part of our normalizing credit environment, the speed at which the increase occurred for us and the broader credit card industry since our first quarter earnings call was faster than planned. This negatively impacted second quarter results and led to an increase in the portfolio's bad debt outlook. As a reminder, credit card revenues for the quarter include the pro-rata recognition of the updated annual bad debt assumption. We will discuss our annual outlook inclusive of the updated bad debt assumptions within the credit card portfolio in just a few moments.The second value creation lever is gross margin. Our gross margin rate was 38.1%, 80 basis points below prior year, but above our outlook. Merchandise margin was 130 basis points lower than last year. During the quarter, we leveraged our data-driven processes and tools to maximize margins and sell-throughs of excess spring seasonal receipts. We surgically implemented clearance markdowns and promotions, which, while above last year's levels, were lower than forecasted in our prior outlook. Merchandise margin also impacted by unfavorable category mix shifts and a shift in the timing of shortage recognition, partially offset by better inbound freight charges from our cost savings efforts. In relation to shortage we added a June physical inventory count in certain categories with low RFID penetration.This helped us better understand shortage trends and informed our outlook and approach to receipt planning for the remainder of the year. The count did not materially change our annual assumption, but it did provide actuals for the categories counted in the second quarter. As a result, we adjusted our shortage accrual shifting a portion of the recognition out of the fourth quarter and into the second and third quarters. Lastly, delivery expense decreased 50 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to improved carrier rates from contract renegotiations as well as lower fuel costs and lower vendor direct volume. Now, let's turn to our third value creation lever, inventory productivity. End of quarter inventory was down 10% year-over-year and down 18% to 2019, which should represent a low point for the fiscal year.Trailing 12-month inventory turnover was roughly flat for last year. Inventory management is a key tenet to further improve the omnichannel customer experience. We're committed to having current and compelling product at the appropriate receipt levels, based on expected sales demand. Expense discipline is the fourth value creation lever. SG&amp;A expenses of $1.98 billion were better than our expectations, declining $31 million, or 1.5%, from prior year. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue was 37.5%, 300 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the decline in year-over-year sales. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.26 versus $1 in 2022. Better-than-expected sales, gross margin, and SG&amp;A were offset by credit card revenues and shortage, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.11 and $0.04, respectively, relative to the midpoint of our prior outlook.Combined, this was roughly a $0.15 impact to EPS. Lastly, the fifth value creation, lever capital allocation. During the first half, we generated $271 million of operating cash flow versus $303 million last year. The change was primarily due to lower earnings, partially offset by lower merchandise inventories and merchandise accounts payable. We had $564 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow, inclusive of proceeds from real estate, was an outflow of $261 million. And year-to-date, we paid $90 million in dividends. Regarding capital deployment, in times of uncertainty, liquidity and a healthy balance sheet remain top priorities. They provide us the flexibility to respond to changing consumer and competitive trends, while continuing to invest in our core business and growth vectors.Now, let's discuss the full year and third quarter outlook. To level set, we continue to have a cautious view on the consumer. In addition to the headwinds discussed on prior earnings calls, the expiration of student loan forgiveness beginning in October, higher interest rate levels, and lower new job creation are all new pressures on the consumer. While we had contemplated these factors when providing an annual outlook on our last earnings call, it is still unknown how consumers will respond to them, especially after so many months of increased pressures. As such, we believe it is prudent to maintain our cautious view on the consumer and their capacity to spend on the discretionary categories we sell. Even with this backdrop, there is much that remains in our control.Entering the third quarter, inventories are clean, current, and fresh with an improved fashion and seasonless composition at compelling values that we believe appropriately reflects demand. Quarter-to-date sales results are in line with our expectations on reduced year-over-year promotions and clearance activity. Now, that I've provided the framework on how we are thinking about the back half, let's walk through our updated full year expectations. Our full year outlook now contemplates reduced credit card revenues and asset sale gains, both of which are fully offset by better-than-expected second quarter results and favorable changes in interest expense and share count. Our outlook continues to include approximately $200 million of cost savings discussed on our last earnings call.For fiscal 2023, we now assume net sales of $22.8 billion to $23.2 billion. Comparable sales on a 52-week owned-plus-licensed basis to be down about 7.5% to down 6% to last year. As a reminder, compares ease in the third and fourth quarters. Other revenue to be about 3.2% of net sales, with credit card revenues accounting for roughly 80% to 81% of that. The increased bad debt expectation for the credit card portfolio has resulted in a reduction in our annual forecast of roughly $80 million relative to our prior expectation. Given the magnitude of the credit card revenue impact, I want to take a moment to provide additional color. Credit card revenues are predominantly driven by the level and health of sales and receivables generated from our proprietary and co-brand credit cards.While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs. These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio. We are working closely with our bank partner, Citibank, to mitigate the rising bad debt by adjusting underwriting strategies. We also remain focused on acquiring new customers and retaining our active customer base as we communicate future personalized value to our customers. But we are not assuming any benefits in the near term. Additionally, potential regulatory changes regarding late fees are still pending.We'll keep you updated as we learn more. Returning to the remaining line items, we are anticipating a gross margin rate of 38.3% to 38.6%, which is slightly better than our prior expectations of 38% to 38.5%. Our assumption for shortage, which impacts gross margin, remains materially unchanged. Shortage continues to be a headwind, and we are focused on a variety of mitigation strategies, including testing the use of advanced technology, reporting, and tools; moving high-theft product away from entrances in our stores, optimizing asset protection staffing to target high-risk areas and collaborating with external parties to advocate for legislative change. Now let's turn to SG&amp;A. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue is expected to be 35.6% to 35.2%, or 36.7% to 36.4% as a percent of net sales, reflecting ongoing expense discipline efforts with additional risk on the low end, given the importance of protecting the customer experience.Asset sale gains are now expected to be approximately $50 million, with nearly all the remaining gains anticipated in the fourth quarter. While the real estate market has become more challenging in light of higher interest rates, there is no change to our asset monetization strategies. We are confident in the value of our assets, have seen these cycles before, and we'll be patient to ensure we receive the appropriate valuations for our properties. Fortunately, we have the balance sheet to do so. We expect to achieve adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue of roughly 8.7% to 9.4%, or 9% to 9.7% as a percent of net sales. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $160 million. After interest and taxes, we are maintaining our annual adjusted diluted EPS of $2.70 to $3.20, which reflects an updated annual diluted shares expectation of roughly 279 million shares.There are lots of moving parts to our annual EPS outlook. To summarize, relative to our prior expectation, gross margin, SG&amp;A, and shares are the primary benefits. When looking at the low and high end of our current outlook compared to what we discussed on our first quarter call, gross margin, inclusive of volume and mix, is positively contributing an incremental $0.14 to the low end and $0.06 to the high end of our prior outlook. SG&amp;A is contributing an incremental $0.06 to $0.19. And together, lower share count and interest expense are contributing an incremental $0.04. These factors reflect solid execution in our core business and represents a $0.24 to $0.29 benefit relative to our prior outlook. On the flip side, reduced credit card revenues are a $0.21 to $0.22 drag on the low end and high end of our prior outlook, while lower asset sale gains are a $0.03 to $0.07 negative impact.Combined, this also represents $0.24 to $0.29, essentially canceling each other out. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance does not assume potential share repurchases. For the third quarter, we expect net sales of $4.75 billion to $4.85 billion, gross margin rate to be at least 140 basis points better than the third quarter of 2022. As a reminder, last year, Macy's had elevated promotions and markdowns to clear excess receipts in warm weather seasonal goods and slower-moving pandemic-related categories, including casual apparel and soft home. Adjusted diluted EPS down $0.03 to up $0.02, inclusive of our updated credit card revenues outlook and the timing shift in the recognition of shortage. End of quarter inventories to be down low-to-mid single-digits to last year on a percentage basis as we begin to introduce Nike and further support On 34th and INC private brands.Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving low-single digit sales growth beginning next year and believe that improved underlying fundamentals and the early contributions of our five growth vectors will provide an offset to ongoing macro pressures impacting our consumer. However, we do have additional external factors that are more difficult to combat. If recent trends in credit card revenues, shortage, and asset sale gains continue, and late fee regulatory changes are passed, the ability to achieve low-double digit EBITDA margin in '24 becomes more challenging. Now, to be clear, there have been no changes to the underlying assumptions and opportunities regarding the rest of our business. We're actively working to offset headwinds, prioritize growth, and we'll share more as the year progresses.I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks.Jeff Gennette: Thank you, Adrian and Tony. It has been exciting to watch you two collaborate on innovative ways of opportunity that reflect your unique lenses and backgrounds, and I am confident that you will lead Macy's, Inc. to sustainable long-term profitable growth. Now, operator, we will now open it up for Q&amp;A.See also 12 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Now and 12 Best Places to Retire in Brazil.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Oliver Chen: Hi, Jeff, Tony, Adrian, good morning. 2Qs were -- 2Q revenue and margins were encouragingly better. What was the driver behind that? And as we look at 3Q guidance being below Street, I assume it's primarily the credit card delinquency, bad debt expense. AURs were also encouragingly up. What was the offset to that? We assume it could have been traffic. And a follow-up, as you think about longer term, the small-format opportunity, how are you dimensionalizing the addressable market there? Thank you.Adrian Mitchell: All right. So, Oliver, good morning to you. It's great to be with you. So look, despite the timing shift that we recognized with shortage, we achieved the gross margin rate in the second quarter ahead of our expectation. So, we were actually quite pleased with that. Now, while the second quarter was more promotional than last year as we worked to clear a lot of the seasonal product that we talked about, it was less promotional than we had anticipated. We leaned into a lot of our strategic and personalized promotions. We've been into our pricing science, as we've talked about prior. But look, leveraging the data-driven processes that we've had in place and been using for the last couple of years allowed us to really maximize our margins and sell-throughs as we actually exited the spring season.Now, as we did in previous seasons, we're actually able to clear through a lot of the seasonal product that we've spoken about several weeks ahead of schedule. So, we're continuing to take these behaviors into the back half of the year.Jeff Gennette: The other thing I'd add on that, Oliver, would be just our inventory is in a great position. So, exiting the third quarter, down 10%, we have been able to retain a lot of liquidity that will respond to customer interest. But our stock-to-sales ratios are good by category. The third quarter has started at expectation. We're looking at the back-to-school read, as well as really all new fall fashion and how that's performing. And we have confidence as we go into the fourth quarter on our strategies.Adrian Mitchell: If I could just answer your last question, Oliver, with regards to small-format stores, we're very excited about the growing impact of our small-format stores. As you know, we remain in the early stages of continuing to scale this opportunity, but we did announce that we're opening up a number of stores this fall. Chicagoland, Boston, Las Vegas, San Diego are several locations where we'll be opening up our small-format Macy's stores. And in the Seattle market, we'll be opening up a small format Bloomingdale's. Last week, we did open up a store in Chicagoland. But as we think about the quality of experience for our customers, we continue to see positive signals in terms of the financial performance and the customer experience within these stores. So, we're actively evaluating potential locations across the country that will enable us to accelerate growth at the appropriate time. So more to come on this topic.Oliver Chen: Best regards. Thanks.Adrian Mitchell: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Matthew Boss: Great. Thanks. So, Tony, could you just elaborate on the key strategic initiatives that you believe best positions Macy's for a return to revenue growth next year? And then Adrian, any notable differences in topline by income cohort that you're seeing today, maybe relative to three months ago? Any change in macro that you're embedding for the back half of the year? And then just given the potential external changes that you mentioned, how best to think about a range of EBITDA margin outcomes for next year relative to the low double-digit target that you've laid out?Tony Spring: Thanks for the question, Matt. Let me begin with the opportunities for growth. Just as a reminder, I've been a part of the Macy's executive leadership team for the last few years and working closely with Adrian and Jeff and other senior leaders the last few months. And I remain bullish on the opportunities for the entire portfolio. And remember, Macy's, Inc. is a portfolio company with, obviously, power in the Macy's brand, Bloomingdale's brand and Bluemercury brands. I believe that our opportunity remains in going off-price to luxury, multi-brand, multi-category. And these five growth vectors are designed to help us to amplify our business. They are designed around merchandise, which includes private brand and making sure that we are bringing the most important market brands to all of our portfolio.The reintroduction of Nike and the announcement of Under Armour is a good example of that. It's strengthening our marketing, but on a more personalized basis, with specific offers that are right for that customer, at the level of modernization in our marketing, it's also making sure that our portfolio has the right number of stores in the right locations that include the quality malls that we're in today as well as, as Adrian described, the right small-format locations that densify, replace existing stores that may not be as productive or allow us to enter new markets. The luxury business is a piece of the puzzle that we feel very strongly about. It underscores the importance of Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, but also gives us the opportunity to expand the Macy's beauty business.And as we mentioned, beauty is a category that's grown across every single nameplate. So, we feel strongly about all of our growth vectors. But in answering fully your question, I think the growth opportunity for the Macy's brand requires us to dig deeper into the assortments and making sure that we eliminate redundancy and we improve variety, making sure that people find the brands they're looking for, as well as the level of exclusivity that comes from our private brand assortment. And the final piece I would say is the team is highly focused on improving the customer experience, physically and digitally, doing those things that are necessary to create a more seamless and easier omnichannel experience.Adrian Mitchell: Matt, good morning. Just going through a few points that you raised. The first is, we have a discerning customer across all income tiers. They're being quite choiceful about how they think about experiences versus discretionary goods. And so, we continue to be thoughtful about focusing on the things that we can control to deliver a positive experience for our customers. The reality is, in the macro environment, we continue to remain cautious, as we spoke about earlier in our opening remarks. We do believe that there continues to be pressure within the macro environment. So, we will continue to remain cautious. To your third dimension around EBITDA margins as we think about next year, the first thing that we would emphasize is what Tony spoke to, which is our top priority is profitable growth.And that profitable growth is about low-single digit growth beginning next year, and we remain confident in that. The kinds of things that we're controlling is our balance sheet, the operating disciplines that you've seen from us around inventory management and expense management, the quality of execution on our fundamentals within our core business, and we continue to see that our five growth vectors remain on track. Now, as it relates to low-double digit EBITDA, it remains our aspiration longer term. Now, as we look on the horizon in the near term, we see several factors worsening and difficult to offset, again, in the near term. And as we spoke about earlier in the call, credit card revenues, shortage, and asset gains are all the type of things that are at the top of our list.So, look, as we think about credit card revenues, we've experienced higher aged balances across all delinquency levels, which just lead to increased bad debt impact in our credit card. And as you know, there's still an open question about the legislative ruling on limiting late fees, which is something that we'll have to quantify the potential impacts of if that ruling comes to fruition. Shortage, as you know, has been an industry-wide opportunity. It has been at elevated levels for multiple years. Shortage, for us, for the second year in a row will be at record levels. Now, we continue to put mitigation strategies in place to address that, but these mitigation strategies will likely take time to effectuate. And then obviously, with regards to real estate, the industry is really challenged right now with higher interest rates, higher cap rates, and higher hurdle rates.We do have confidence in our real estate, but we will be patient on our ability to monetize those assets. So, when you look at the confluence of all these different factors, our ability to achieve low-double digit EBITDA in the near term may be more challenging. But as we progress through the year and we focus on our expense management initiatives and the growth initiatives that Tony referenced, we'll share more in the near future.Matthew Boss: Great color and best of luck.Adrian Mitchell: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Brooke Roach: Good morning and thank you for taking our question. Adrian, I was hoping you could help us understand the potential levers that you have for additional improvement in margin rate should the consumer dynamic backdrop worsen into the back half of the year. How are you thinking about merchandise margins and promotional backdrops, and what are the incremental opportunities in SG&amp;A expense beyond what you've already identified?Adrian Mitchell: Absolutely. Thanks very much for raising the question, Brooke, and good morning to you. As we think about gross margin, the disciplines that you've seen from us are pretty key, and that's really around strong execution on the customer experience and healthy inventory management. Now, we've talked a lot about inventory management from the perspective of the volume of inventory, which allows us to limit our markdowns, the composition of inventory that allows us to support full price sell-through, as well as the freshness of inventory to have the relevant content for our customers to shop from us versus the competition. We'll continue to be very thoughtful about executing on those, but you've seen us pretty consistently execute on the gross margin side over time.The one thing I would call out as we think about gross margin for the balance of the year is we've done something a little bit different this year with shortage. So, this year, we actually had a midyear shortage -- midyear inventory count, which gave us greater confidence and visibility into shortage trends for the year. So, we did recognize some shortage in Q2. We will recognize some shortage in Q3 and Q4, which is different from what we've done in prior years, which is to recognize it all in the fourth quarter. So, we are very thoughtful about how we're thinking about the margin rate going through the balance of the year. We're excited about the composition of inventory. We're excited about all the initiatives that Jeff and Tony spoke to, but we also are cautious in terms of making sure that we have the capacity to respond to growth opportunities and to absorb any potential promotions that we may need to do to move through the business in the fall season.As it relates to SG&amp;A, we continue to feel good about the $200 million that we spoke about in cost savings earlier in the year. We spoke about it in our June 1st call. We've been working on it for a number of months. We're seeing those come through, and a larger portion of those benefits, both on the SG&amp;A expense and the gross margin expense, is expected to materialize in the back portion of the year, with the biggest being in the fourth quarter. But we continue to be very focused on expense discipline, and that's something that you'll continue to see us focus on for quite some time.Brooke Roach: Great. Thank you so much.Adrian Mitchell: Thank you, Brooke.Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.Greg Sommer: Hi. This is Greg Sommer on for Chuck. I just wanted to dig into the health of the consumer a little more, looking at the outperformance of Bloomies outlet and then also Backstage and then also higher credit card delinquencies. It would suggest that the health of the consumer has deteriorated and even at the high end. I was just curious, is this accurate? I wanted to get more color on the health of the consumer, either by what you're seeing in terms of performance by store banner or what you're seeing when you dig into the credit card data. Thank you.Adrian Mitchell: So, why don't I start with the credit card data, and then we'll talk a little bit about the consumer a bit more broadly. So with regards to the credit card data, the one thing I would say that -- is that we're managing our credit card revenues to the best extent we can. And I think the credit card revenues is an indication of some of the pressures that we're actually seeing on the consumer. So, as you know, we have actually planned out higher delinquencies based on the expectation of a normalizing credit environment. But what we did see is that the speed of those delinquencies across all age balances -- or aged balances actually accelerated after Q1, and that occurred primarily in June and July. So, we've made a number of adjustments there.Now, what's interesting about this is that there are things that we can control and things that we cannot control. The things that we're controlling is that we're working actively to mitigate a lot of the headwinds that we see. So, for example, we are working with our credit card partner, Citibank, to target higher risk segments to surgically reduce exposure. We're also maintaining spend in places where we can for customers that have the capacity. We're acquiring new customers, we're retaining active customers, and we're focusing on the spend on their -- at Macy's on their prop card. But there are things that we cannot control, which I think gets very much into what you're describing around the health of the consumer, and that's the macro environment.So, the macro environment really is having the lion's share of the impact on credit and is a real indicator of where we think the health of the consumer is and supporting our cautious approach. The one metric we find quite interesting is the debt/service ratio, which we leverage as a proxy for the consumer's ability to pay debt using their disposable income, personal income. So, this is about credit card balances. This is about student loans, which we know is going to come into focus in the next month or two; auto loans; mortgage. So, we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure, because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.Jeff Gennette: Chuck, what I'd add is your question about off-price. So, just know that when -- we've always been quoting what's going on with our off-price business between Bloomingdale's and Macy's. You heard that off-price at Macy's outperformed the balance by almost 300 basis points at outlet Bloomingdale's versus the Bloomingdale's brand. It was about an 800-point difference. That really is just our -- when you think about being, in most cases, mall based to have an off-price option has been a potent part of our discovery with off-price. And so, what we have seen over time is that there is no cannibalization that's going on between the full price and the off-price side. It's just building stickier relationships with customers.They're building up their spend with us. They're shopping more frequently. We certainly saw that in the second quarter. And then to your question about kind of how different income levels has been affected, we'll talk about the Macy's brand. Certainly, the Macy's brand is more under pressure, and it really is the stat of that 50% of the Macy's customers are making $75,000 or less. So, they've been under pressure. I think there are some headwinds coming, particularly with student loan, that expiration of the loan forgiveness. And what we're really looking to do is controlling what we can control and ensuring that we've got the right stock-to-sales ratio in all of our categories and that we've got receipt reserve to chase into demand. So we feel good about our fourth quarter strategy, and we feel good about where our inventories are right now with this consumer.Greg Sommer: Great. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Blake Anderson of Jefferies. Please go ahead.Blake Anderson: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little -- or give a little bit more color on the monthly trends you're seeing in maybe back to school? And then just higher level, talk about your confidence in the comp guide in kind of reiterating the comp guide for the rest of the year. I know you've talked about some pressures on the consumer, but you're being conservative. Just give a little bit more commentary on your decision to reiterate the previous comp guide for the year. And then second question was, on the promotional environment, wondering if you can talk about your expectations for the holiday in terms of promotions, and then how you're planning inventory for the holiday?Jeff Gennette: Okay. Hi, Blake. So, first off, let's just talk about the second quarter. So, we're not disclosing our monthly performance. But as we talked about on the first quarter call, we did expect the second quarter to be promotional, based on the spring seasonal inventory overhang, and we successfully liquidated any sort of liability that we had coming into the third quarter. So, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in looking at that trend since that is more clearance-driven than what we are planning are -- and experiencing right now in the third quarter. Third quarter started at our expectation, really a mix between our back-to-school performance, as well as new fall fashion. And just to kind of reiterate, having those fundamentals in place of the stock-to-sales ratio, being in stock on all the most important items, having discipline with our pricing science and getting great traction on that, having inventory be as healthy as it is with a strong balance sheet, and then really green shoots in our four growth factors is really kind of the state that we're walking into the fall season with.So, as we talk about the fourth quarter, we have confidence in our strategies. So, the trending businesses, like beauty and some of the gifting businesses, are a higher penetration of the fourth quarter business than it is the other three quarters. We should draft off of that. When you look at the amount of newness that we have in gifting, so high quality, great value -- and that great value is built into our gross margin expectation for the fourth quarter. So, we're going to be sharp on our values. We're going to be competitive. As we've seen over the past couple of years, the customer is shopping earlier and they're shopping all the way through Black Friday, Cyber Monday, taking the lull last 10 days. We're ready for all that. We've built the promotional calendar so that we thought through all of where -- the customer, where we expect them to shop in each of our brands.I think specifically, when you look at the fourth quarter, in addition to the gifting strategies and the penetration of trending businesses, it's also the add of Nike, it's the Toys R Us and the Disney collaboration. Very importantly, just the liquidity to be able to respond to inventory that's always in the system and this agile team that is responding in real time faster than ever. So that's what -- is what is built into our guide when we think about the back half of the year and the status of what we are -- of where we're at going into it.Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.Dana Telsey: Hi, good morning, everyone. As you think about the bad debt expense and credit cards, have you looked at it versus 2008, what could be similar and what's different in the trajectory? And then as you think about this current second quarter, how did -- what was the cadence of the quarter? How did you exit? I know, Jeff, you mentioned just about third quarter and back to school. Anything on tourism that we should note? And then Tony, just on other brands, it's nice to see Nike and Under Armour. Are there other categories that you want to enhance the brand assortments that we should be looking to? Thank you.Adrian Mitchell: Good morning, Dana. I'll start with regards to the -- your question around credit card, and then I'll have Jeff and Tony speak to the quarter cadence. So, look, we've looked at our credit card revenues and bad debt levels as far back as 2005 in our recent conversations. So, we have a good understanding of the puts and takes. We recognize that there have been evolutions in terms of our agreement with Citibank. But from our perspective, it's continuing to control the controllables and continuing to navigate beyond controllables, as I mentioned a little bit earlier. Again, as I shared, so much of this is really around the health of the consumer and so much is also around what we consider to be the debt/service ratio.As you think about the average household income in the US, you think about the average household income of our customers, particularly in the Macy's brand, that consumer is experiencing a number of headwinds as they think about servicing their responsibilities and their liabilities. I referenced a little bit earlier credit cards, I referenced student loans, auto loans, mortgage. All those in a higher interest rate environment creates real challenges. Now, coming into the year, we did project bad debt levels to normalize, but they just normalized a little bit faster than expected. But as we continue to look at ways to mitigate by giving more personalized offers to customers, as well as increase usage on our proprietary credit card, acquiring new customers, and really leaning into the loyalty aspects, we're working very diligently to find the best offsets we can.Jeff Gennette: Dana, I'm going to -- I'll take on the cadence by month and the tourism, and I'll hand it over to Tony on new brands and new categories. On the -- as I mentioned in my conversation earlier, to the question from Blake, we're not disclosing our monthly performance in that it was heavily markdown and promotional-driven. So, that is on the second quarter. As it relates to tourism, this is one that we still have not seen the return of the depth of the international tourists that we typically have at Macy's and Bloomingdale's. So, just to remind, our international tourism is generally 3% to 4%. That's what it was in pre-pandemic sales. It's now south of 2% of our overall business. So, that tailwind is coming in the future.We're not predicting yet when that's going to be, but know that when you look at the second quarter tourism business versus the first quarter, it was pretty similar. It was pretty comparable from where we are versus the 2019 level. I'll turn it over to Tony.Tony Spring: Thanks, Dana. I think the introduction of Nike is just a good example of what's possible as we go forward. It's an important brand, the number one brand in the active category, and I think we obviously have built into our expectations the opportunity in Nike. The other benefit you have is, people who come to Macy's for Nike don't just buy Nike, they're going to buy other things. So, I'll tell you what I shared with the team last week as they took me through the spring merchandise assortments. First, I was excited to hear the level of newness and discovery and the interest in variety and the desire to bring more interest to our assortments. And I think that that level of curiosity, that level of newness is an important ingredient in our success going forward.I think the other thing that's important is looking at these categories that are adjacent. So, we have Marketplace, which allows us to test quickly, introduce brands and ideas that we haven't had at Macy's or Bloomingdale's before. And then we can move quickly, whether we add those things to our stores or whether we keep them just as a part of the Marketplace. But I think the team is very focused on bringing more newness and more interest and more excitement to our assortments.Dana Telsey: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.Robert Drbul: Hi, good morning, and Tony great to talk with you. Best of luck with this undertaking. Two questions for you. I guess, the first one is, when you think about sort of the trend of digital versus the in-store, how are you thinking about that for the back half of the year? And then on the digital marketplace, is the sort of the ramp on the brands on the platform, especially at Macy's, is that where you want it to be or will you be adding more brands sort of into holiday and into next year? Thanks.Tony Spring: Thanks, Bob. I think we are excited about the growth of the brand assortment on Macy's Marketplace and, as we mentioned, the early read on Bloomingdale's Marketplace. We have Max Magni, who we mentioned, who joins us after a distinguished 20-plus year career at McKinsey, focused on the digital business, and he will be very helpful, I think, to accelerating our performance in the digital space, as well as in our overall marketplace business. I also want to just remind everyone that Macy's and Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury are omnichannel businesses. And while we will always have these accelerations and movements based on cycles between the channels, our focus is making sure that we satisfy the customer, no matter where they choose to shop.So that's a part of our small-format expansion, because customers are going off-mall. That's a part of renovating in beauty at Macy's and on main floor Bloomingdale's, our most important mall doors, because that's where people go to shop. That's a part of our investment into new experiences online, because we want to make sure that we are both a place of transaction, as well as a place of experience on Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and bluemercury.com. So, we really do manage between the channels, but we ultimately are focused on satisfying the customer.Robert Drbul: Got it. And the other question I have is just on delivery expense. I think it was down this quarter. But I guess, how are you planning that for the remainder of the year?Adrian Mitchell: Well, delivery expense has been a part of some of the cost savings initiatives that we've thought about, which impacts the combination of the placement of our goods within our system and also how we think about the processing of our delivery. So, look, it continues to be an opportunity for us. We continue to benefit from some of the renegotiated terms with regards to our carrier expenses. We're continuing to look at opportunities to truly optimize how we think about owned versus VDF versus Marketplace, which not only improves our expense profile, but also improves our margin profile. And so there's just a number of ongoing efforts that we have as it relates to inventory and as it relates to delivery expense.Robert Drbul: Thank you.Adrian Mitchell: No problem.Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup. Please go ahead.Paul Lejuez: Hey, thanks, guys. Can you remind us what percent of your sales are done on credit? How that looks versus last year? And you also mentioned mitigating exposure to higher-risk customers. What percent of your credit card portfolio is made up of those customers, and those -- do those mitigation efforts not have an immediate effect? You didn't reduce in second half sales guidance, I don't think at all. And I'm curious, how long it might take those efforts to have an impact potentially on the topline that you would incorporate into your guidance? Thanks.Adrian Mitchell: Absolutely. Paul, great to be with you. So, on your first question, in recent history, we've typically been at around 2.9% to 3% of net sales. But if you look further back in history, it's actually been lower than that. So, the question that was raised earlier about looking at our credit card revenues as a percent of net sales, we've looked at it as far back as 2005 and understanding the puts and takes that actually impact that performance. As it relates to the health of our credit card portfolio, we have a healthy portfolio. As I've mentioned before, we look at a number of factors beyond FICO scores to understand the health of the consumer, their capacity to spend, make thoughtful decisions about their line of credit, who we approve on the card versus not.So there -- we do have a healthy portfolio. We look at our return on assets and we'll continue to do that. I think the reality of what we've seen in the credit card shift is really around the pressure on the consumer. And again, that's the lion's share of the impact that does impact our credit card revenues. But look, we've seen these cycles before. We've been through these cycles before, and we will continue to work to find mitigation strategies within the context that we're given to increase credit card revenues to the appropriate levels, leveraging our personalized capabilities, continuing to expand our customer base across all nameplates. So it's just another dimension of our business that we have to manage actively as we go forward.Paul Lejuez: Adrian, what percent of your sales are done on credit, the proprietary credit card?Adrian Mitchell: So, within our loyalty program, they're about 70%. I think about 72% of sales are done across our loyalty program, but our bronze tier is a non-tender tier. So, when you look at our gold, silver, and platinum our penetration rate today is about 43%.Paul Lejuez: Got it. And what percent of the higher-risk customers that you mentioned?Adrian Mitchell: Look, Paul, we have a healthy portfolio. We are not in -- deep into subprime, if that's the nature of your question. We are not approving high-risk customers. We want to have healthy customers using our card for a longer period of time. And so, we do not lean aggressively into subprime.Paul Lejuez: Okay. Thank you. Good luck.Adrian Mitchell: No problem.Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Alexandra Straton: Great. Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Just two from me. The first is just on SG&amp;A. I wanted to dig in there a little bit more. It seems like the guidance contemplates higher SG&amp;A than prior, but I know you reiterated the $200 million in savings that you've identified. So, can you just hash out further what's changed there or seemingly worsened versus three months ago?And then secondly, strength in select categories like beauty, are you all mixing further into those categories as a result, or how nimble can you be as you see strength or weakness in certain categories? Thanks a lot.Adrian Mitchell: All right. So, thanks so much for the question, Alex. Let me start with SG&amp;A, and then I'll hand it over to Tony and Jeff. So, look, our outlook includes a portion of the $200 million in annual cost savings that we identified and spoke to on the June 1st call. We spoke to the fact that 70% of that is SG&amp;A, related to simplifying a lot of our processes and driving efficiencies across the business. The remaining 30% is really around things like delivery expense and inbound freight that was raised earlier in the conversation. Now, as we demonstrated in the second quarter, SG&amp;A was better than our expectations due to these disciplines and these initiatives that I've referenced. And we continue to be very focused on expense management.We think there's lots of opportunities and, especially, in this environment, with so much volatility that we're responding to, we're very focused on expense management and discipline as best as we can. As we think about the back half of the year, we'll continue to be focused on expense management, but what's really important as well is making sure we have the appropriate level of investment in the customer experience. Our biggest quarter is ahead of us, which is the fourth quarter. That's where we tend to win as a gifting destination. And so, we want to make sure that the customer has options, that we don't compromise the shopping experience, and we take advantage of the biggest opportunity we can to have a solid year.Jeff Gennette: And then, Alex, let me talk about the second part of your question. We -- based on the liquidity that we have always built in -- and that's a new discipline that we've had over the past year and a half. We always have receipts that can chase into signals that are positive. And just as rigorous is what we do on a weekly basis is cutting back on signals that we expected that didn't materialize. So, the opportunity to always be going where the customer is, this has not been an issue of not having brands or inventory available in the system to react to. So, this is -- we've, obviously, as we've discussed in the past, have changed our relationship with our key vendors, really buying more to net cost, not buying into markdown allowances, giving us full flexibility to respond to the customer in the moment.So, we have confidence that, to your question about beauty, we can chase into beauty. We have obviously built very aggressive strategies for the fall season, based on our trends and our merchandising teams and the strength of those brands, and where our customer expects us to be. So, some we plan and some, we're going to react to and chase into.Tony Spring: And Alex, let me add that we have strength and beauty across Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. So that's digitally and physically on-mall and off-mall. And fragrance is an important category for us and trending well in all three nameplates. So we're bullish in the business for the fall.Alexandra Straton: Thanks a lot.Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Please go ahead.Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to focus for a minute on your cost savings programs. You have spoken about a $300 million to $350 million run rate of savings in fiscal '24, but it seems that you're outperforming that early. How much of these savings are included in the 2023 guidance versus how much will be incremental in 2024?Adrian Mitchell: Thank you for your question. It's a good question, Lorraine. So, as we referenced, the $200 million this year is a combination of both gross margin and SG&amp;A expense. What we spoke to on the last call was that there is an annualized benefit of about $300 million to $350 million. Now, the reality is that we're continuing to benefit from those opportunities and those initiatives this year. So, we're pretty excited about what we're seeing here. The key thing I would say is that the initiatives are real. And as an organization, we're continuing to lead into these expense opportunities. We have not given specifics on how this will materialize as we get into next year. We're still working through kind of how we think about our growth profile and margin profile for next year. But we'll definitely keep you posted and give you much greater clarity on those puts and takes as we get into 2024.Lorraine Hutchinson: And then I just wanted to follow up on credit. It sounds like the second quarter numbers included pro-rata recognition for the updated annual bad debt outlook. But it looks like you're guiding second half down to a similar decline. Can you talk about the dynamics of this revenue stream going forward?Adrian Mitchell: Yep, absolutely. So, the leading indicator on bad debt write-offs are the delinquency rates. So, we look at it at 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, and 30-day increments, all the way up to 180 days, which is when the write-off actually happens. So from our perspective as we think about past purchases and we see the level of delinquencies that has been increasing across all aged balances, we're actually projecting what we believe to be the bad debt levels, given the trends that we see. So given those leading indicators and what we see with other factors in and around the consumer, that gives us a perspective and a greater level of confidence around what we believe our credit card revenues will be based on our bad debt levels.Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.Adrian Mitchell: No problem.Operator: Thank you. Our last question for today will be coming from Jay Sole of UBS. Please go ahead.Jay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. Just two questions from me. One, on the delinquency rate that you cited for June and July, was the delinquency rate higher in July than what you saw in June or was June the peak and then it slowed in July? And then secondly, just on the small stores, can you just elaborate a little bit on the proof points that you're seeing that give you confidence to open up more small stores? And how many small stores you see the company opening up over the next, say, six months to 12 months to 18 months? Thank you.Adrian Mitchell: Thanks so much for your question. So, on delinquencies, the thing to keep in mind is that we did plan for higher delinquencies this year. We have spoken a number of times over the last 18 months about the credit environment really normalizing. But this was the first time in the second quarter where we actually saw that our projections were more conservative than the actuals. So what we've done with the acceleration, particularly that we saw in June and July, is that we've adjusted our trajectory per Lorraine's question that I spoke to a few moments ago. But effectively, what we've been doing is looking at that on a regular basis and making the appropriate adjustments for the trajectory of the return to a more normalized environment.As we think about small-format stores, there are kind of three key things that we think about. The first is the quality of the customer experience. And as we look at a number of factors, including the availability of product, the quality of the experience, there's quality of service, all these different factors what we're seeing are very healthy numbers as we think about the performance of these stores and the quality of the experience for the customer. The second thing that we look at is the financial trends of the business. And so, for stores that are comped, we're seeing healthy year-over-year growth in this portfolio, and we're getting better. We see lots of opportunity around product, around how we engage customers in the local market.But even in spite of our learning experience, we continue to see growth in stores that are actually comping. The third thing that we're excited about is the potential that's ahead. And so when we think about where customers are, where we can invest, we see a portfolio of healthy big box stores, where we'll continue to invest, complemented by a large number of small-format stores. We do believe that there is an opportunity to accelerate over the next several months in the time frame that you described, but we'll be able to share more specifics on that, hopefully, in the coming months and quarters.Tony Spring: Yeah. And, Jay, I would add that we're excited in the Macy's small-format that we now have Polo and Levi's and Finish Line and Sunglass Hut and now Nike added to those stores. And as Adrian mentioned, looking very carefully at traffic, conversion and a whole host of other metrics to make sure that we are seeing the proof points necessary to expand the portfolio of small doors.Jay Sole: Got it. Thank you so much.Adrian Mitchell: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gennette for closing comments.Jeff Gennette: So, thanks, operator, and for all of you who's still on the call, I hope that you enjoy the last days of summer, and we look forward to updating you on our results on the third quarter on our November call. Thanks, everybody.Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in Macy's. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.]"

Also, focus on non-gaming investments bodes well. However, increased operating expenses is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock.Factors Likely to Drive GrowthWynn Resorts derives a solid share of revenues from Macau — the most prominent gaming destination in the world. The worst seems to be over for Macau's gaming industry as China's economy is slowly gaining momentum. During the second quarter of 2023, Wynn Resorts witnessed growth in Macau's mass gaming, luxury retail and hotel businesses, portraying exceptional post-Covid recovery.During the fourth quarter of 2022, Wynn Resorts (Macau) entered into a 10-year agreement with the Macau government to renew its gaming concession, covering Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace Cotai. The company is confident that the proposed capex and programming will drive growth in the upcoming periods. For 2023 (through 2024), the company expects capex related to concession commitments to be in the range of $300-$400 million.Wynn Resorts focuses on non-gaming avenues to drive growth. In second-quarter 2023, the company’s non-gaming business witnessed robust growth owing to strength across retail business. The non-gaming business witnessed robust growth owing to strength across the retail business. During the quarter, non-gaming revenues increased 3.8% year over year to $55.1 million. Attributes such as quality product and service offerings, the relaunch of the loyalty program (in Macau) and the robust non-gaming events calendar added to the positives. Moving ahead, the company emphasizes innovative non-gaming investments to boost tourism and strong shareholder returns. This includes investments in a new theater and events and entertainment center, incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities. During the second quarter of 2023, the company stated advancement concerning the East of Broadway expansion project in Boston.The emphasis on the expansion of new markets bodes well. Wynn Resorts and Marjan, RAK Hospitality Holding recently inked an agreement to develop a multibillion-dollar integrated resort on the artificial Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. This move marks Wynn Resorts’ foray into a new market. The resort is scheduled to open in 2026. This will mark the company’s first resort in the MENA region. During the second quarter of 2023, the company progressed with respect to the project design. Also, optimism can be noted due to opportunities arising from the backdrop of beachside setting development.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, shares of Wynn Resorts have surged 54.6% compared with the industry’s 16.7% growth.ConcernsIncreased operating expenses are a concern for the company. During the second quarter of 2023, the company’s total operating expenses came in at $ 1,345.5 million compared with $960.9 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily due to a rise in casino, room, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other and general and administrative expenses. However, this was partially offset by a fall in property charges and other expenses. The company remains cautious of wage inflation and interest rate increases.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksWynn Resorts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are:Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Wynn ResortsWynn Resorts’ CEO said recently that efforts to secure a gaming license for the Wynn Al Marjan in United Arab Emirates’ Ras Al Khaimah is “imminent” and gave additional details.Skift reported last November that Wynn had confirmed there would be a casino at the property. However, questions have lingered due to the UAE’s strict Islamic laws, which don’t permit activities like gambling.The Wynn Al Marjan Island property would be the first-ever gaming resort in the Gulf region.On an August 9 conference call, CEO Craig Billings said that there’s no requirement for a nationwide legalization process.“We have everything we need to operate gaming in Al Marjan,” Billings said on the call. “And I think there’s confusion here because there’s a lack of understanding regarding individual emirates versus the UAE as a whole.”Billings clarified that the structure of UAE features individual emirates operating within a broader federal system.“There should be no concern that a broader legalization process needs to occur in order for gaming to occur in that property,” Billings said.Billings explained that while discussions may be underway about legalization at the federal level covering all emirates, he expects that Wynn will have its license for Ras Al Khaimah soon.“So while there may be conversation in other Emirates about legalization or legalization at the federal level, thereby covering all Emirates, I expect that we will have our license for Ras Al Khaimah actually imminently,” BIllings said during the recent earnings call.Billings has previously said that the casino at Wynn Marjan would be “somewhat larger than” the flagship U.S. gaming venue — Wynn Las Vegas.He said construction has commenced.Opening and More Details on The ResortAnnounced last year, the 1,500-room Wynn Marjan is scheduled to open in 2027 on the man-made Al Marjan Island of Ras Al-Khaimah.At $4 billion, it would be Ras Al Khaimah’s largest foreign direct investment project.Story continuesEarlier this year, Wynn unveiled the design vision of the resort, inspired by the seascape of Al Marjan Island, a group of four islands.The resort is being developed with local partners Marjan and RAK Hospitality Holding.Ras Al Khaimah is hoping to welcome over 3.8 million visitors by 2027, according to a recent report by global property consultant Colliers. In 2022, the emirate recorded 1.13 million overnight hotel guests.Based on the impact of the opening of gaming facilities on visitation and considering the characteristics of tourism in the emirate, Colliers estimates that Ras Al Khaimah will welcome 3.8 million tourists by 2027 and more than 5.5 million visitors by 2030.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Its diversified product portfolio caters to eight core species — cattle, swine, poultry, fish and sheep (collectively, livestock) and dogs, cats and horses (collectively, companion animals).Zoetis has been witnessing excellent growth trends in revenues and earnings per share owing to the strong performance of its companion animal products. Its key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, have been contributing heavily to the top line, demonstrating strong uptake in both the United States and International business segments. Apoquel is approved as a control of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis.Year to date, shares of Zoetis have surged 24.8% against the industry’s 5.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe FDA recently approved Apoquel Chewable tablets in the United States for controlling pruritus related to allergic dermatitis and control of atopic dermatitis in dogs at least 12 months of age. The chewable version is expected to have comparable efficacy to the original Apoquel (oclacitinib tablet) after the first dose. Zoetis believes that the formulation of Apoquel Chewable has a better formulation which could enhance medication compliance and therefore improve outcomes for dogs. Hence, demand is expected to be strong.The approval of new drugs like Simparica Trio in Europe and the United States has strengthened the company’s market-leading parasiticide portfolio for companion animals. Zoetis’ new monoclonal antibody therapies, Librela and Solensia, for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats also exhibited sales growth in the last reported quarter, contributing to the increased revenues.Story continuesThe company continues to bolster its vaccine portfolio for livestock. In the United States, this business segment witnessed year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 2023 due to an increase in cattle product sales like Draxxin and implant product Synovex. In the International segment, the livestock business performance in the last reported quarter was relatively consistent with the year-ago figure, on a reported basis.ZTS’ total companion animal products and livestock products portfolios are expected to witness a CAGR of 9.1% and 3.9%, respectively, over the next three years.The company has also been expanding its business through acquisitions. Such expansion initiatives bode well for the company, thereby strengthening its position in the animal healthcare market.However, Zoetis’ prospects for its livestock products continue to be threatened by disease outbreaks among animals.Such outbreaks may hurt regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of the same due to either heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, in turn dampening demand for livestock products.Additionally, outbreaks of highly contagious diseases near the company’s main production sites could require an immediate production halt or force the company to incur substantial additional expenses for procuring raw materials or products from elsewhere. Thus, such incidents could hurt the top line considerably. Generic competition in the poultry products market is also challenging.Moreover, Zoetis faces stiff competition from other animal health medicine and vaccine companies like Merck Animal Health and Elanco Animal Health, which acquired Bayer’s Animal Health business in August 2020.However, the sales of the company’s pet care and livestock products, coupled with its expansion strategies, are expected to be the key growth drivers of ZTS in the quarters ahead amid uncertainties.Zoetis Inc.

We have also discussed challenges that veterinarians face and the companies that continue to contribute to the well-being of animals. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Veterinarians. While veterinarians are one of the most trusted professions in America, according to the 2022 Global State of Pet Care report, access to veterinary services exhibits huge disparity across global markets, with over 100,000 active veterinarians in the US compared to a few hundred in countries like Kenya. Developed countries predominantly focus on small animals, while developing markets emphasize livestock care, potentially lacking expertise for optimal pet health.Rising veterinary caseloads impose burdens on the mental and physical health of veterinarians which is also evident through increasing burnout and stress levels across the profession. Moreover, medicine access poses a concern for 75%of veterinary associations which hampers their capacity to deliver quality service.On the other hand, telemedicine has experienced a surge, especially in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, with over 60% of pet owners willing to pay for these services. This also explains why telemedicine has become one of the best work-from-home jobs for 2023. Yet, a shortage of veterinarians for pets is also evident globally as the US alone requires 41,000 veterinarians by 2030, which is also projected to fall short by 15,000. Speaking of shortages, New Zealand is one of the countries where veterinarians are most needed. It is also worth mentioning pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agrochemical are top 3 industries that employ veterinarians. Animal caregivers are also one of the most in-demand jobs for the future.Adtalem Global Education Inc (NYSE:ATGE) is actively addressing the pressing issue of global veterinary shortages through strategic partnerships and educational initiatives. In collaboration with Bishop's University in Quebec, Canada, Adtalem Global Education Inc (NYSE:ATGE)’s institutions like Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (RUSVM), are offering a number of career pathways for aspiring veterinarians to fulfill the growing demand for qualified professionals. Through RUSVM's Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program, Adtalem Global Education Inc (NYSE:ATGE) prepares veterinary leaders who contribute to human, animal, and ecosystem health with unparalleled skillset which also aligns with the One Health Initiative.Story continuesIn addition, there are emerging innovations in veterinary care, such as gene therapy for cancer, reduced antibiotic usage tools, pet wearables, and varied pet nutrition options that also highlight some progress for pet care.When we talk about progress in the field of veterinary, and while we also have established that healthcare is one of the major industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies, it is worth noting that AI in veterinary practices enhances efficiency without replacing expertise. To read about jobs that can be negatively effected, you can check out our article on Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.Tasks like data entry and test analyses which are time-consuming for humans in any industry, are streamlined by AI. For the veterinary industry, specialized AI, such as VETSCAN IMAGYST and SignalPET, aids in diagnosing diseases. Moreover, generative AI shows promise for automated diagnoses and personalized treatments. This newly observed efficiency allows professionals to focus on treatments, care, and bonding. Hence, cost savings from automation can make higher-quality care affordable.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (NASDAQ:IDXX) is a big name in veterinary diagnostics and innovation, that has once again demonstrated its commitment to contributing to animal health with the launch of a groundbreaking diagnostic test. According to IDEXX' Laboratories, Inc (NASDAQ:IDXX)’s survey, a one-third of kidney cases observed by veterinarians are linked to kidney injury, which is often a diagnostic challenge owing to its subtle symptoms. In response, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (NASDAQ:IDXX) introduced the first IDEXX Cystatin B Test which is a veterinary diagnostic tool designed to detect kidney injury in cats and dogs. By providing an industry-first biomarker for kidney injury, IDEXX Laboratories Inc has empowered veterinarians to intervene earlier and facilitate more effective treatments,However, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (NASDAQ:IDXX)’s impact on the industry extends beyond individual tests. As evidenced by the recent market trends that reveal how there is a significant 6% increase in same-store clinical visits and a 10% rise in same-store total practice revenue in the US. for the month of July in 2023. With a global presence spanning over 175 countries and a workforce of more than 9,000 dedicated individuals, IDEXX's positive impact reverberates across the veterinary industry and beyond.On the other hand, Zoetis Inc (NYSE:ZTS) has taken a transformative approach to animal care through robust digital and data initiatives.

For example, Zoetis Data Science Forum is a platform that engages over 300 employees, including top executives, to share insights and external case studies.Zoetic Inc (NYSE:ZTS)’s Digital Fluency initiative further improves data literacy and communication across the organization. By aligning its digital and data strategy with value outcomes, Zoetis Inc (NYSE:ZTS) emphasizes its devotion to tangible results that improve animal health. This approach includes initiatives such as predictive analytics to understand customer requirements, supply chain optimization, and research acceleration.

To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy sector, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy.Renewable energy is the fastest-growing energy source in the world as most companies and countries around the world are targeting net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Between 2010 to 2020, renewable energy usage increased by 42% and accounted for 20 percent of utility-scale U.S. electricity generation. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) believes that in 2024, electricity usage through renewables will reach 26% in the US. Furthermore, in 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that global energy sector investments will be at $2.8 trillion, and nearly 61% of that total is expected to be accounted for by renewable energy sources.The biggest economies of the world, the USA and China, have been making significant investments in the industry. In 2022, nearly half of all green energy investments were made in China. The country invested $546 billion in clean energy in 2022, surpassing the United States which made investments worth $141 billion during the same period. Moreover, the European Union recently reached a provisional deal to increase the percentage of renewable energy to 42.5% by 2030 from the current 32%. Since the Paris Agreement of 2015, investments in renewable energy have nearly tripled. Renewable energy investments are also catching pace in South Asian countries as India plans to deploy solar investments of around $25 billion between 2022 to 2027.Challenges Faced by the Renewables SegmentDespite being the fastest-growing segment in the energy sector, installation of clean energy does have its challenges. Weather conditions and time of day significantly affect renewable energy deployment. For example, in 2023, solar energy stocks have been showing a downward trend as storms and rains have delayed solar panel installations.Story continuesIn addition to that, the renewable energy infrastructure costs are quite significant even though the alternative energy usage costs have declined remarkably over the years. Nevertheless, as the technology grows, the costs might go down exponentially. A major factor behind the high costs of clean energy infrastructure is the interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve since early 2022. The high interest rates have affected the deployment as companies mostly borrow money to cover the initial cost of installations and high interest causes an increase in expenditures.Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) was one of the companies that was affected by both of the above-mentioned challenges as mentioned by the Chief Financial Officer of the company, Jeanne Jone during the Q2 2023 earnings conference call:“Earnings are lower in the second quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities as well as $0.03 of unfavorable weather at PECO.”Despite the challenges faced by the renewable energy industry, it is still expected to grow at a tremendous rate and its market size is expected to reach around $2 trillion by 2030. To take advantage of this growth, investors can look towards some prominent clean energy stocks such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).11 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsUbjsP/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyAfter a thorough research of the renewable energy industry, we selected the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders in the second quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was taken from Insider Monkey's database of 910 elite hedge funds.We only chose the stocks that have notable operations or infrastructure in the renewable energy segment and skipped the stocks whose investments in the sector are still in the initial phases.11 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11. NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) is a Texas-based energy company that provides electric utilities to over 7 million customers in the United States. The company distributes electricity through natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear, wind, and solar power sources.In the last three months, 3 out of 4 Wall Street analysts have maintained a Buy rating on NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG). The average analyst price target of $44.25 suggests over 19.5% upside to its stock price on August 21. On July 20, BoFA maintained a Buy rating on the company stock and raised its price target to $46 from $43.In the second quarter, NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was owned by 39 hedge funds with a combined stake value of $1.074 billion.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) are some of the most undervalued renewable energy stocks along with NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG).Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.”10. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is a renewable energy company that develops DC-optimized inverter systems for solar power technology. The company is headquartered in Israel and operates globally.SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SEDG) worth $404.651 million.In the last three months, 13 out of 16 Wall Street analysts have kept a Buy or Overweight rating on SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) stock. The average analyst target for the company is $310.06, compared to the stock price of $163 at the August 21 market close.9. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a British integrated oil and gas company. It also has significant operations in renewable energy such as hydrogen and biofuels. The company also has investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is targeting to reduce half of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. On July 27, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) increased its quarterly dividend per American Depository Share by 15% to $0.662. The dividend will be payable by September 18 to the shareholders of record on August 11. On top of that, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) also authorized a $3 billion share repurchase program on the same day.Third Point Management made the following comment about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We initiated a position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in the summer of 2021 and highlighted the company’s significant discount to intrinsic value as well as to US-listed peers after decades of poor performance. While shares have performed well since we initiated the investment, the company still trades at staggering discount to intrinsic value and represents a compelling investment at current levels. We initially argued (and still believe) that the fastest path to improved performance and better valuation would be a separation of Shell’s business units to better attract shareholders and improve accountability, the latter of which was essential when the company was in the hands of executives who had demonstrated virtually no focus on shareholder value creation.The most important change at Shell over the past two years has been the upgrade in the management team, with the appointments of Wael Sawan as CEO and Sinead Gorman as CFO. They have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to shareholder value, capital discipline, and improved returns. At their recent analyst day, Mr. Sawan stated “underpinning all that we do will be a ruthless focus on performance, discipline, and simplification.” It was the third time they used the term “ruthless” in their presentation, sending a strong message to shareholders…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is an American company that provides electric power, natural gas, and energy management services in the United States. It provides utilities to its customers through fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and renewables. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland.On August 3, Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) posted strong Q2 results with a GAAP EPS of $2.56, outperforming the estimates by a huge margin of $1.94. Its revenue of $5.45 billion exceeded the forecasts by $900 million. The company’s stock closed at $101.14 on the day, registering a 5.85% increase from the August 2 close. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) closed at its all-time high of $107 on August 14.Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stock was owned by 46 hedge funds in Q2 2023, at a combined value of $1.85 billion.Alger Capital made the following comment about Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is America’s leading clean energy company, based on carbon-free production. The company is the largest supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, governments, community aggregations, and a range of wholesale customers (such as municipalities, cooperatives, and other end markets) across the continental U.S., backed by approximately 32,400 megawatts of generating capacity consisting of nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric assets. Constellation produces nearly 10% of the nation’s carbon-free energy.Shares outperformed during the third quarter primarily due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Signed into law in august, the bill provides a nuclear production tax credit of approximately $43.75 per megawatt hour of energy generated. This credit favorably impacted earnings, resulting in an increase in Constellation’s share price.”7. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is a Texas-based electricity and power generation company. It owns the world’s largest battery energy storage system at its Moss Landing Power Plant project in California. Additionally, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) provides electricity through several sources, including solar, wind, nuclear, and natural gas.Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)’s stock was a part of 48 investment portfolios in Q2 2023 and their total stake was valued at $1.58 billion. In the previous quarter, it was owned by 46 hedge funds with a total stake value of $1.51 billion. Oaktree Capital Management held the largest stake in the company with 17 million shares worth $446.25 million.Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share, compared to the previous $0.204. It is payable by September 29 to the shareholders of record on September 20. The company has raised its dividend for the last four years and has a yield of 2.75% as of August 21.Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“I sent the 2019 letter on February 10, 2020. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) closed that day at $22.27. As I write in early January the price is $22.30. Now I did say “We would actually prefer it if both (VST &amp; NRG) securities went nowhere for as long possible”—assuming repurchased shares at depressed valuations was our best-case scenario. But A) I didn’t think I’d be that right with respect to “nowhere”, and B) I certainly didn’t think I’d be right 3-years on. Here we are though, with the stock literally going nowhere for the last 3-years. Just like we drew it up!“Management has indeed repurchased 20.3% of the shares outstanding since year-end 2019 and will probably repurchase another 12-15% of the outstanding shares in 2023. My initial assumption was that management could plausibly repurchase 60% of their shares by 2030, leaving them with 200mn outstanding (that assumed shares were appreciating and they had to pay more as the years went on, not what’s transpired so far), but at the current pace of about 50mn shares repurchased per year, they’ll hit that mark by the end of 2026, which would imply free cash flow of $10 pershare if the underlying business continues to perform as it currently is. That’s a 45% FCF yield on today’s price. Meanwhile, dividends per share have grown 54% since 2019 and the stock now yields 3.5%, growing about 15% a year.Being paid to wait makes waiting much easier. We had sold VST shares in mid-2020, replacing some of the position with call options, to free up capital for other opportunities that became available. But when winter storm Uri hit Texas in February 2021 and VST shares went down 20%+, below $17 a share, we rebuilt our common equity position. Today VST oscillates between the biggest and second biggest position in the fund, depending on weekly performance.”6. Enphase Energy, Inc.

If you don't have long-term plans in place and are currently riding the (sometimes) wild waves of summer market prices, here is a quick update on market fundamentals and some approaches to consider for your buying strategy now that we're in the thick of the hot season.The bulls and the bearsThere are obviously a lot of factors impacting the market-each of which could put potential upward or downward pressure on near-term prices. Let's have a look:WeatherHow is summer weather this year compared to last? When the heat moves up, so does the demand for power, therefore having some insight into the weather can help predict what could happen with electricity prices.Bearish factorsAfter three full years in La Niña conditions, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) region saw strong warming trends this spring then rapidly pushed into neutral-positive territory, with a likelihood of pushing into positive territory.El Niño conditions mean summer 2023 may favor a warm, dry north and a cooler/wet south and fewer Atlantic hurricanes.Bullish factorsSince 2000, summers on average have been trending warmer. In addition, even a cooler/wetter summer has the potential for periods of prolonged heat.Natural gasPower markets can be closely correlated with the natural gas market since natural gas is a key power generation source in most regions. In ERCOT, natural gas is the marginal generation unit that is dispatched, which sets the price in the real-time market, so power pricing trends directionally with gas. Understanding gas fundamentals can provide insight into power price trajectory.Bearish factorsSince the sharp falloff just prior to the start of last year, natural gas production has grown, currently averaging 5 Bcf/day higher year-to-date compared to the same time last year. According to the EIA, we currently sit at a storage surplus compared to last year and the 5-year average.Story continuesTotal U.S. demand January-February 2023 trended quite a bit lower than last year's average for the same period due to warmer-than-average temps across most regions of the country. Near-term prices dropped significantly, with the recent bottom set at the end of February.Bullish factorsThough the market is well-supplied and near-term gas prices reflect that, bullish factors include slowing production growth due to producers' sentiments about production costs being above current NYMEX pricing. Also, the increased demand in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports coming down the curve will further link North America to higher global pricing. Lower production and increased exports would rebalance the market to a higher level. As demand necessitates new production down the road, it may come at a higher cost from inflationary pressures and escalating extraction costs.These bullish factors are reflected in the contango curve-near-term gas prices are lower and longer-term prices are higher.Regional factorsCAISOCalifornia saw large withdrawals from gas storage due to an elongated winter, with below-normal temperatures persisting into mid-April. Although there have been injections into storage and levels are improving, they're trailing last year and the 5-year average. Gas is used as a reliable, dispatchable fuel to generate power, particularly during times of heightened demand in the summer.Bearish factorsHydro power is projected to be very healthy this year, which could offset some of the power burn demand for gas, but supply/demand, and thus pricing, will all be dependent on the weather.Bullish factorsIf gas storage remains low, this could add price support for both gas and power prices, particularly during warmer-than-normal summer conditions.PJM &amp; MISOBearish factorsIf cooler weather prevails, volatility from sustained hot temperatures could be averted.Bullish factorsThere is a focus on power plant retirements due to higher regulatory costs, higher priced coal, and low-capacity auction results. As these plants retire, peaker plants and higher-priced generation assets may be needed to meet the load during high demand periods - which can drive prices higher.Stagnant regional natural gas production can also put pressure on power prices in this region.New generation focuses on renewables, which are intermittent and can therefore cause a risk to the supply/demand mix.NYISO &amp; NEISOBearish factorsIf cooler weather prevails, volatility from sustained hot temperatures could be averted.Bullish factorsBesides facing generation plant retirements, natural gas pipeline constraints also hinder bringing ample gas to the region for power generation.Upstate New York faces transmission constraints and downstate faces higher capacity prices due to demand.ERCOTNatural gas is the marginal generation unit dispatched in ERCOT that sets real-time electricity prices. Load is forecasted to be higher this summer with more renewables and flat reserve margins compared to summer 2022.Bearish factorsWith gas prices being lower now than last summer, so too were historical July-August '23 peak prices leading into the summer.If El Niño conditions are present and cooler and wetter weather prevails, actual demand could be lower and long periods of sustained high temperatures could be tempered.Bullish factorsReal-time grid conditions will be closely correlated to the real-time performance of renewables, such as wind and solar, which are intermittent.Supply growth during the afternoons is expected to outpace peak demand, while demand growth is expected to outpace supply growth during non-solar hours. This implies the tightest hours of the grid will shift away from HE17 toward HE21 at sunset when reserve margins are much tighter. With a larger percentage of non-dispatchable operating reserves, there may be a higher likelihood for scarcity pricing going forward.Buying considerationsIf you're waiting to lock in near-term prices or riding the index market, then you are probably pleased with your strategy based on depressed forward and index prices. A 12-month contract starting in July 2023 may have been more expensive last year than it is now but be careful, as summer weather can shift quickly and drive both index and forward prices higher.With a contango curve shape for both gas and power forwards, longer-term hedges may not reflect as much value as shorter-term deals - but don't ignore the more bullish fundamentals outlined above. Some ideas to consider:There may be a sweet spot for locking in your requirements now for a shorter to mid-length term.Consider a hybrid strategy whereby you can lock in some of your requirements to help protect your budget from full exposure to potential summer price volatility, while also having the opportunity to capitalize on lower market prices that may continue during the summer.For longer-term purchases, consider that while the contango market doesn't provide discounts by going long-term, you may still be able to lock in a year-over-year rate decline, depending on your previous contract terms.Consult with your NRG Account Executive on pricing and terms for your region and specific usage requirements so that you can make the best decision for your business.NRG Energy, Inc.

To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy sector, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy.Renewable energy is the fastest-growing energy source in the world as most companies and countries around the world are targeting net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Between 2010 to 2020, renewable energy usage increased by 42% and accounted for 20 percent of utility-scale U.S. electricity generation. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) believes that in 2024, electricity usage through renewables will reach 26% in the US. Furthermore, in 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that global energy sector investments will be at $2.8 trillion, and nearly 61% of that total is expected to be accounted for by renewable energy sources.The biggest economies of the world, the USA and China, have been making significant investments in the industry. In 2022, nearly half of all green energy investments were made in China. The country invested $546 billion in clean energy in 2022, surpassing the United States which made investments worth $141 billion during the same period. Moreover, the European Union recently reached a provisional deal to increase the percentage of renewable energy to 42.5% by 2030 from the current 32%. Since the Paris Agreement of 2015, investments in renewable energy have nearly tripled. Renewable energy investments are also catching pace in South Asian countries as India plans to deploy solar investments of around $25 billion between 2022 to 2027.Challenges Faced by the Renewables SegmentDespite being the fastest-growing segment in the energy sector, installation of clean energy does have its challenges. Weather conditions and time of day significantly affect renewable energy deployment. For example, in 2023, solar energy stocks have been showing a downward trend as storms and rains have delayed solar panel installations.Story continuesIn addition to that, the renewable energy infrastructure costs are quite significant even though the alternative energy usage costs have declined remarkably over the years. Nevertheless, as the technology grows, the costs might go down exponentially. A major factor behind the high costs of clean energy infrastructure is the interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve since early 2022. The high interest rates have affected the deployment as companies mostly borrow money to cover the initial cost of installations and high interest causes an increase in expenditures.Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) was one of the companies that was affected by both of the above-mentioned challenges as mentioned by the Chief Financial Officer of the company, Jeanne Jone during the Q2 2023 earnings conference call:“Earnings are lower in the second quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities as well as $0.03 of unfavorable weather at PECO.”Despite the challenges faced by the renewable energy industry, it is still expected to grow at a tremendous rate and its market size is expected to reach around $2 trillion by 2030. To take advantage of this growth, investors can look towards some prominent clean energy stocks such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).11 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsUbjsP/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyAfter a thorough research of the renewable energy industry, we selected the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders in the second quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was taken from Insider Monkey's database of 910 elite hedge funds.We only chose the stocks that have notable operations or infrastructure in the renewable energy segment and skipped the stocks whose investments in the sector are still in the initial phases.11 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11. NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) is a Texas-based energy company that provides electric utilities to over 7 million customers in the United States. The company distributes electricity through natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear, wind, and solar power sources.In the last three months, 3 out of 4 Wall Street analysts have maintained a Buy rating on NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG). The average analyst price target of $44.25 suggests over 19.5% upside to its stock price on August 21. On July 20, BoFA maintained a Buy rating on the company stock and raised its price target to $46 from $43.In the second quarter, NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was owned by 39 hedge funds with a combined stake value of $1.074 billion.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) are some of the most undervalued renewable energy stocks along with NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG).Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.”10. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is a renewable energy company that develops DC-optimized inverter systems for solar power technology. The company is headquartered in Israel and operates globally.SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)’s stock was owned by 43 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 42 in the previous quarter. D E Shaw increased its stake in the company by 68% in Q2 and remained the largest stakeholder for the second quarter in a row. The firm owned 1.5 million shares of SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) worth $404.651 million.In the last three months, 13 out of 16 Wall Street analysts have kept a Buy or Overweight rating on SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) stock. The average analyst target for the company is $310.06, compared to the stock price of $163 at the August 21 market close.9. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a British integrated oil and gas company. It also has significant operations in renewable energy such as hydrogen and biofuels. The company also has investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is targeting to reduce half of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. On July 27, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) increased its quarterly dividend per American Depository Share by 15% to $0.662. The dividend will be payable by September 18 to the shareholders of record on August 11. On top of that, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) also authorized a $3 billion share repurchase program on the same day.Third Point Management made the following comment about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We initiated a position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in the summer of 2021 and highlighted the company’s significant discount to intrinsic value as well as to US-listed peers after decades of poor performance. While shares have performed well since we initiated the investment, the company still trades at staggering discount to intrinsic value and represents a compelling investment at current levels. We initially argued (and still believe) that the fastest path to improved performance and better valuation would be a separation of Shell’s business units to better attract shareholders and improve accountability, the latter of which was essential when the company was in the hands of executives who had demonstrated virtually no focus on shareholder value creation.The most important change at Shell over the past two years has been the upgrade in the management team, with the appointments of Wael Sawan as CEO and Sinead Gorman as CFO. They have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to shareholder value, capital discipline, and improved returns. At their recent analyst day, Mr. Sawan stated “underpinning all that we do will be a ruthless focus on performance, discipline, and simplification.” It was the third time they used the term “ruthless” in their presentation, sending a strong message to shareholders…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is an American company that provides electric power, natural gas, and energy management services in the United States. It provides utilities to its customers through fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and renewables. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland.On August 3, Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) posted strong Q2 results with a GAAP EPS of $2.56, outperforming the estimates by a huge margin of $1.94. Its revenue of $5.45 billion exceeded the forecasts by $900 million. The company’s stock closed at $101.14 on the day, registering a 5.85% increase from the August 2 close. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) closed at its all-time high of $107 on August 14.Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stock was owned by 46 hedge funds in Q2 2023, at a combined value of $1.85 billion.Alger Capital made the following comment about Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is America’s leading clean energy company, based on carbon-free production. The company is the largest supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, governments, community aggregations, and a range of wholesale customers (such as municipalities, cooperatives, and other end markets) across the continental U.S., backed by approximately 32,400 megawatts of generating capacity consisting of nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric assets. Constellation produces nearly 10% of the nation’s carbon-free energy.Shares outperformed during the third quarter primarily due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Signed into law in august, the bill provides a nuclear production tax credit of approximately $43.75 per megawatt hour of energy generated. This credit favorably impacted earnings, resulting in an increase in Constellation’s share price.”7. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is a Texas-based electricity and power generation company. It owns the world’s largest battery energy storage system at its Moss Landing Power Plant project in California. Additionally, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) provides electricity through several sources, including solar, wind, nuclear, and natural gas.Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)’s stock was a part of 48 investment portfolios in Q2 2023 and their total stake was valued at $1.58 billion. In the previous quarter, it was owned by 46 hedge funds with a total stake value of $1.51 billion. Oaktree Capital Management held the largest stake in the company with 17 million shares worth $446.25 million.Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share, compared to the previous $0.204. It is payable by September 29 to the shareholders of record on September 20. The company has raised its dividend for the last four years and has a yield of 2.75% as of August 21.Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“I sent the 2019 letter on February 10, 2020. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) closed that day at $22.27. As I write in early January the price is $22.30. Now I did say “We would actually prefer it if both (VST &amp; NRG) securities went nowhere for as long possible”—assuming repurchased shares at depressed valuations was our best-case scenario. But A) I didn’t think I’d be that right with respect to “nowhere”, and B) I certainly didn’t think I’d be right 3-years on. Here we are though, with the stock literally going nowhere for the last 3-years. Just like we drew it up!“Management has indeed repurchased 20.3% of the shares outstanding since year-end 2019 and will probably repurchase another 12-15% of the outstanding shares in 2023. My initial assumption was that management could plausibly repurchase 60% of their shares by 2030, leaving them with 200mn outstanding (that assumed shares were appreciating and they had to pay more as the years went on, not what’s transpired so far), but at the current pace of about 50mn shares repurchased per year, they’ll hit that mark by the end of 2026, which would imply free cash flow of $10 pershare if the underlying business continues to perform as it currently is. That’s a 45% FCF yield on today’s price. Meanwhile, dividends per share have grown 54% since 2019 and the stock now yields 3.5%, growing about 15% a year.Being paid to wait makes waiting much easier. We had sold VST shares in mid-2020, replacing some of the position with call options, to free up capital for other opportunities that became available. But when winter storm Uri hit Texas in February 2021 and VST shares went down 20%+, below $17 a share, we rebuilt our common equity position. Today VST oscillates between the biggest and second biggest position in the fund, depending on weekly performance.”6. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) provides solar power solutions, battery energy storage solutions, and EV charging stations. The company focuses primarily on residential customers. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is headquartered in California and serves over 140 countries.

154,1c860ece-f9b2-34d7-bca6-ab7c7cf5548e,NEE,2023-08-24,Is It Worth Investing in NextEra (NEE) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-nextera-nee-based-133006289.html,1692797406,STORY,['NEE'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about NextEra Energy (NEE).NextEra currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NEECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for NextEra here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying NextEra, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is NEE a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.11.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for NextEra.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The solar project will join its other renewable energy initiatives to achieve net-zero emissions from its electric generation and natural gas infrastructure by 2050.D continues to make systematic investments in solar, battery storage and hydropower projects.  The company has planned an investment of $42 billion in offshore wind and solar projects during 2022-2035.Growth ProspectsSolar energy constitutes a major portion of the U.S. renewables market. As stated by Wood Mackenzie in its latest report, solar constituted 54% of the new electricity-generating capacity additions in the nation in the first quarter of 2023, outweighing all other energy sources. Per the Solar Energy Industries Association report, the solar market is projected to triple over the next five years.This should benefit Dominion Energy and other prominent utility players like NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, Entergy Corp. ETR and Alliant Energy Corp. LNT that are enhancing their footprint in the U.S. solar market.NextEra plans to add 33-42 gigawatts (GW) of new renewables during the 2023-2026 period. In July 2023, NextEra Energy partnered with Sysco Corporation to help the global foodservice distribution company reduce its carbon footprint.NEE’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 8.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 29.4% over 2022’s reported figure.Entergy has almost doubled its renewable capacity in the past three years and plans to add more than 4,500 MW by the end of 2025. The company’s subsidiary, Entergy Mississippi, is expected to be the fastest-growing renewable power portfolio in the state and one of the fastest-growing in the country. It currently has a 180 MW West Memphis Solar facility, which is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2024.ETR’s long-term earnings growth rate is 5.7%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.41%.Alliant Energy is the largest owner-operator of regulated solar in Wisconsin. The company plans to add 1.1 GW of solar energy within the state by mid-2024. In August 2023, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved two Alliant Energy battery energy storage projects — the 100-MW Grant County Battery Project and the 75-MW Wood County Battery Project.LNT’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 4.8% over 2022’s reported figure.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past three months, shares of Dominion Energy have lost 6.8 % compared with the industry’s 5.4% decrease.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankDominion Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is McKesson (MCK).

This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 23.26. MCK's P/CF has been as high as 23.66 and as low as 11.52, with a median of 13.51, all within the past year.Story continuesInvestors could also keep in mind Patterson Companies (PDCO), an Medical - Dental Supplies stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Patterson Companies is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 13.36 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.45.

161,b09b73c6-b8f3-3042-8fd5-12e73bc3d446,SPGI,2023-08-24,Stock market today: Wall Street mixed early as Nvidia pushes Nasdaq higher,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-asian-shares-064736355.html,1692859656,STORY,"['SPGI', 'NVDA']","[TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly fell Friday, discouraged by a Wall Street slump that followed a blowout profit report from Nvidia and mixed reports on the U.S. economy.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 1.8% to 31,713.24 in morning trading. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped nearly 1.0% to 7,111.60. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.6% to 2,522.09. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.0% to 18,035.97, while the Shanghai Composite shed 0.3% to 3,073.25.Tokyo inflation eased to 2.9% in August from the previous year, largely because of lower energy prices, according to government data. The consumer price index, excluding fresh food prices, rose 2.8% from the previous year, the gains easing for the first time in two months.Although inflationary pressures appear to be gradually fading in Japan, amid stabilizing energy prices, the indicator for prices is still above the Bank of Japan's target of 2%.High on regional investors' minds is the speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, scheduled for later in the day. He’ll be speaking at an event in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that has been the site of major policy announcements in the past by the Fed.On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.3% for its worst loss in three weeks. It nearly wiped out its gain for the week, which had been a bright spot in what's been a rough August.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 373 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 1.9%.Stocks sank as Treasury yields stabilized following their tumble a day earlier. High yields in the bond market have been upping the pressure because they make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks and other risky investments. They may be set to go even higher, depending on what the head of the Federal Reserve says in a speech.The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23% from 4.20% late Wednesday. It fell there from 4.33% a day before, close to its highest level since 2007.Story continuesYields found some traction following mixed reports on the U.S. economy. One showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. Another said orders for long-lasting manufactured goods slumped by more last month than economists expected.For now, weaker-than-expected reports on the economy may be more welcome in financial markets. The economy has managed to avoid a long-predicted recession, but the fear is that it's so solid that it will keep upward pressure on inflation.The Federal Reserve has already raised its main interest rate to the highest level since 2001 in hopes of grinding down high inflation. High rates work to do that by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for investments.Hope had built that the Fed’s latest rate hike in July may prove to be the last of this cycle, after inflation cooled considerably since peaking above 9% last summer. Traders also have made bets for the Fed to begin cutting rates early next year. But a series of stronger-than-expected reports on the economy has diminished those hopes.The two-year Treasury yield, which moves closely with expectations for the Fed, rose to 5.01%. A day before, it had dropped to 4.98% from 5.05% after a report suggested U.S. business activity is cooling in August.That weaker-than-expected report pushed John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, to think Powell may not sound as aggressive about keeping rates high.But he still says Powell “will likely express concerns about inflation not falling fast enough and that the market should not expect any cuts through at least the first part of 2024.”Thursday's weakness for stocks came despite a much stronger-than-expected profit report from Nvidia, one of Wall Street's most influential stocks. That raised hopes that this year’s frenzy on Wall Street around artificial intelligence technology isn’t just hype.Nvidia first stunned the market three months ago when it said the quick adoption of AI would send its revenue soaring in the three months through July. Its sales came in even better than forecast, at $12.51 billion, and the company gave a forecast for the current quarter that again blew past Wall Street’s expectations.All told, the S&amp;P 500 fell 59.70 points to 4,376.31. The Dow dropped 373.56 to 34,099.42, and the Nasdaq sank 257.06 to 13,463.97.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $79.36 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 30 cents to $83.66 a barrel.In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 146 Japanese yen from 145.81 yen.

Notably, the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking index has plunged 13% so far this month (read: Banking Woes Still Linger? ETFs in Focus).The ETFs in the space also declined. SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF KRE, iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF IAT and Invesco KBW Regional Banking ETF KBWR are down 5.3%, 7.5% and 5.4%, respectively over the past month.What Happened?Earlier this week, rating agency S&amp;P Global cut its credit ratings on some regional lenders with high commercial real estate exposure, citing a “tough” lending environment currently. It lowered its ratings of five banks and put two others on notice for potential downgrades.This decision, as reported by Reuters, is attributed to rising funding costs and challenges in the commercial real estate sector, which are anticipated to challenge the creditworthiness of these lenders. The relentless series of rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve has compelled banks to offer higher interest rates. This is because higher rates have raised costs at banks, which now must pay more interest on deposits to keep customers from seeking higher-yielding alternatives.S&amp;P Global’s move mirrors the actions of Moody's, which had previously downgraded the credit ratings of 10 small to mid-sized U.S. banks by a notch. The rating agency said rising funding costs, a possible decline in deposit levels and weaker profitability pose risks to the banking sector. It also warned that it might cut ratings of some of the biggest U.S. lenders and placed six banks under review for a potential downgrade (read: Moody's Downgrade 10 U.S. Banks: ETF Strategies to Play). Further, another chief rating agency, Fitch also warned that several prominent U.S. banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, might face downgrades if the banking sector's ""operating environment"" continues to worsen. In June, the credit agency downgraded the score of the U.S. banking sector's “operating environment” to “AA-“ from “AA,” raising concerns over the health of the sector.We have profiled the abovementioned ETFs below:SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE)SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF provides exposure to the regional banks segment by tracking the S&amp;P Regional Banks Select Industry Index.

168,936c8cff-1153-39f4-9590-258b7d2812f4,QCOM,2023-08-24,Nvidia earnings: Company is 'defying all odds': Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-earnings-company-defying-odds-214733998.html,1692827253,VIDEO,"['NVDA', 'AVGO', 'AMD', 'QCOM', 'AMAT', 'MRVL', 'INTC']","[Nvidia reported another blockbuster earnings report. The company's second quarter results handily beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines, while also providing third quarter revenue guidance that was above expectations. Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan says the company is ""defying all odds"" and is ""definitely the poster child for AI right now."" As for what Nvidia's results say for the chip sector as a whole, Morgan tells Yahoo Finance Live, that Nvidia will ""lift the whole group.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: We're taking a look at the after hours trading. We're looking at gains right now of 10%, a massive beat across the board when it comes to this quarter's numbers and also what they're forecasting for their third quarter. We're looking at gain of just about 7%.Right now, NVIDIA seeing third quarter revenue of $16 billion plus or minus 2%, blowing past the Street's expectations of $12.5 billion for the most recent quarter, the second quarter revenue of $13.5 billion. The estimate was for $11 billion. That's up 101% from a year ago. Adjusted EPS $2.70, beating the Street's expectations. Also, adjusted gross margin coming in better than expected.We want to break it all down with Daniel Morgan, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager. Daniel, it's great to see you again here.DANIEL MORGAN: Hello.SEANA SMITH: So we're seeing this reaction after hours. Lots of excitement around this report. There was a heck of a lot riding on it. What's your biggest takeaway from these NVIDIA numbers?DANIEL MORGAN: Well, it's kind of funny. Coming to this report, it kind of felt like a carnival, right? I've been following NVIDIA for a very long period of time. And this is the most-- highly focused quarter I've ever seen. You know, you went through the numbers earlier. There were a couple of things that stood out to me.Even though the consensus on the Street for their data center business was about $8 billion in revenues, they did over $10 billion. And the whisper number was $10 billion. So they beat the whisper number on the data center group. And then, of course, as you mentioned, the guidance that they gave going into their third quarter, $16 billion plus or minus 2%, way above the consensus estimate, which was at $12.5 billion.Story continuesSo I think overall, again, I think what this shows is that generative AI in terms of NVIDIA is for real. We're seeing a material impact on their bottom line like we haven't really shown with a lot of other companies and that NVIDIA is defying all odds in regards to the data center. We know that data center CapEx rates have been slowing down. Growth rates have been slowing down.We saw that with AWS, up only 12% in the last quarter. We just had Snow come out earlier. They basically had good numbers. But they didn't guide up. So, again, NVIDIA defying all odds. And they are definitely the poster child for AI right now.DIANE KING HALL: So I want to ask-- yeah, they definitely are. I mean, again, we constantly talk about how they are the leader of the pack. I mean, a huge jump in revenue, even better than expected, better than these whisper numbers that we've heard what are you looking to hear on the call from CEO Jensen Huang, which will be coming up at about 5:00 PM Eastern?DIANE KING HALL: I think the focus on the call is going to be the guidance for the third quarter. We mentioned $16 billion plus or minus 2%. There were worries coming into this quarter that their supplier, which is TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor, may have some issues in terms of filling supply.Now, we know that the demand is there, obviously, for NVIDIA. So they'll probably be a lot of questions on the call from analysts who are going to be asking him, does he feel there's any risk with this new very high sales target in terms of the third quarter, that they may have some issues filling those orders in terms of capacity, in terms of packaging? I've heard all kinds of rumors flying around of what TSMC is going to have to struggle with to get those numbers out. So I think that's what everyone's going to, you know, be worried about, that that may not materialize because of supply issues, not demand issues.SEANA SMITH: Certainly, we've heard that could be the one limit here--DIANE KING HALL: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: --to growth going forward, those supply issues. When you take a look at the reaction that we're seeing from some of the rivals-- AMD, Broadcom. Both of those stocks moving to the upside on the heels of these results-- what does NVIDIA mean more broadly to the chip makers, other players within the AI space?DIANE KING HALL: Well, it's absolutely huge. I mean, you look at the competitors, right? You've got-- NVIDIA has about a 70% market share. You have AMD with their MI300 chip, which they just brought out, which everybody's very excited about. You have Broadcom with their Jericho3 that's going to come out next year. Marvell Technologies, who's going to report tomorrow night, they have their 800G PAM4 DSP chip, which they've already said is going to double revenues because of AI.So it's going to lift the whole group. There are other companies in the space that have AI offerings. Qualcomm has their AI 100. Intel has the Falcon Shore chip that comes out next year. So I would expect the NVIDIA report to lift all in the NI space, including AMD, you know, Broadcom, I would expect to get a nice bump up on this news and so forth and also some of the equipment makers, I would imagine, like Applied Materials and ASML, who make the equipment that go into the actual fabs.SEANA SMITH: Daniel, how does NVIDIA stay ahead of the competition? Right now, certainly, they have a wide lead. What do they need to do in order to maintain that move?DIANE KING HALL: They have the most amount of chips in that space. And as your other guest was mentioning, they charge a lot more than everybody else. So I think going forward, with their technology and their lead ahead of the pack and the fact that they have such a wide offering, I think that's going to help them a lot opposed to some of the other companies I mentioned may have only a single offering in the AI space.So it really comes down to NVIDIA's R&amp;D, their ability to continue to go leaps and bounds in terms of adding new chips, and continuing to offer a better chip than the competition. And up to this point, obviously, they've been able to do that.]"

170,5b1e9831-4284-34a7-88e8-39d66f9364eb,QCOM,2023-08-24,Nike stock tumbles amid China's economic slowdown,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nike-shares-tumble-amid-chinas-160832533.html,1692806912,VIDEO,"['SBUX', 'FL', 'NKE', 'QCOM']","[Nike (NKE) shares continue to drop as China's slowing economy takes its toll on the company. This marks the longest losing streak for Nike since the company's IPO in 1980. Yahoo Finance Live discusses some of the challenges Nike and other companies, like Starbucks (SBUX) and Qualcomm (QCOM), are facing in the country.Video Transcript- Nike is suffering a record-losing streak as slow recovery In China continues to batter the retailer. The company slid for the ninth straight session yesterday, marking the longest downward trend since its 1980 IPO for its shares. We're taking a look at Nike's stock here on the day even, and shares of NKE as we pull them up for our viewers on screen, you're seeing them slipping. Once again, they're down by about 4%.And for those who kind of think back to what the company had to say in the 22 times that China was mentioned in its most recent earnings call, the company continues to really round out how they're looking at the expansion in Southeast Asia and India. But of course, with one of the world's largest youth populations of course, in China, where young consumers seeking top product innovation, Gen Z coming of age as the country's most active generation ever. It's amazingly critical to get the strategy right in that region.- Yeah, and they make about an estimated 14% or so, according to Bloomberg, of their sales from China, from greater China this year. That number's fluctuated a little bit. But the point is they get a decent chunk of their revenue from the likes of China.So we focused not just on Nike and what's been happening as of late and the slide that it's been seeing there, but we've talked a lot about the other American companies that get a big chunk of the revenue from China. You think of Starbucks off the top of your head. A lot of tech companies also, of course, rely heavily on China. Qualcomm gets a large percentage of its revenue from China according to Barron's, and some of the other chip makers as well. So that's something to keep in the back of your mind when thinking about China exposure for companies.Story continuesAnd then there are also some of the Casino companies that rely on Macau that we've seen sort of wax and wane according to the whims of the Chinese authorities and what kind of curbs they're putting on spending at casinos there. So there's quite a lot of companies that fall into this category.- Yeah, there are. And I think for Nike, it's also worth noting here that as we were looking through some of the results from other retailers that carry Nike products where Nike even with its direct to consumer strategy, which has been wildly successful for the company in driving more of that connection and engagement and being able to even round out more of a digital touchpoint with end consumers and not have to go through a middleman of a retailer like a Foot Locker or like a Macy's, of course, in some instances, they still retain that partnership.So you can glean a little bit of how Nike is being impacted and perhaps even in the share price action today, how some of that might be derivative of what we're hearing from the likes of a Foot Locker even.And the mix, the inventory mix and the product mix that's flying off of shelves this year compared to last year wildly different. Last year, it was all about what panda dunks you could get. This year, it's more increasingly about, where are people leaning into some of the different running categories? Where Nike is going up against the HOKA, they're going up-- and HOKA and Decker outdoor brands. They're going up against comfort in Crocs even.But in all of the considerations that the brand has in terms of the mix and where it's sold, creating even more digital touchpoints that sell at full price has been the challenge in this environment too.- Yes, that's been a challenge for everybody, as we talked about earlier, that the promotioning is back. One more thing to note about Nike. Here we are in the thick of retail earnings season. We heard from Dick's, we heard from Foot Locker, which could potentially presage bad numbers maybe for Nike. We've gotten a lot of Chinese economic data. Again, that could potentially, if you extrapolate, be bad for Nike.We don't actually hear from Nike in terms of its earnings probably until the end of September, because they are on a different earnings reporting schedule. So that's just something to keep in mind. Yes, they could come out with an update at some point. But in the absence of that, investors are left to just sort of wonder what to make of all of these various crosscurrents that we're talking about. And maybe, and not maybe because it's happening today, they're going to sell first and ask questions later.- Yeah.- Try to verify later, I guess.- Sip some tea leaves the best they can. Do you sip a tea leaf?- You scatter them and you look at them.- OK.- Yeah, or you look at them, the dregs in the bottom of the cup and try to read them. That's where it comes from.- Bingo.- I don't know how to do it, but that's where the expression comes from.- It's complex.]"

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies, James Thompson, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$132 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$109. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year QUALCOMM insiders didn't buy any company stock.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that QUALCOMM insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$146m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About QUALCOMM Insiders?The fact that there have been no QUALCOMM insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of QUALCOMM, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.FE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.24, while WEC has a forward P/E of 18.46. We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2.21. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.21.Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P/B ratio of 1.88. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WEC has a P/B of 2.24.These metrics, and several others, help FE earn a Value grade of B, while WEC has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesFE is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that FE is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The panel Committee voted unanimously (13-0) on safety and in favor (7-6) of the effectiveness of the Symplicity blood pressure procedure. The Committee's vote was closely divided on the benefit/risk profile of the device (tied at 6-6 and one abstention), with the panel chair breaking the tie, resulting in a final 6-7 vote.""We appreciate the robust conversation that occurred prior to the vote,"" said Jason Weidman, senior vice president and president of the Coronary and Renal Denervation business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""We will continue to collaborate with the FDA on bringing a new option to the millions of people living with high blood pressure.""The CSDP is designed to review and evaluate data regarding the safety and effectiveness of devices for use in the circulatory and vascular systems and make appropriate recommendations to the FDA Commissioner. The panel recommendation will be considered by the FDA as it continues to review the Medtronic Symplicity Spyral RDN System for U.S. market approval.""The Symplicity Blood Pressure Procedure has the potential to fill a significant unmet need in hypertension care, and we know patients are looking for options in addition to medication and lifestyle modifications to manage their blood pressure,"" said David Kandzari, M.D., chief, Piedmont Heart Institute and Cardiovascular Services and lead principal investigator of the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED clinical trial. ""The totality of evidence demonstrated that there is a benefit with the Spyral RDN catheter, and there is no question about the safety of the procedure.""The Medtronic SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Program is the most comprehensive clinical program studying RDN for more than 10 years in more than 4,000 patients in the presence and absence of medication, and with high baseline cardiovascular risk. The Symplicity blood pressure procedure has demonstrated sustained and durable drops in blood pressure out to three years in randomized control and real-world registry trials.[1],[2],[3],[4] Story continuesAbout Hypertension Hypertension, or high blood pressure, impacts nearly 1 billion adults worldwide1, and is the leading modifiable cause of heart attack, stroke, and death. Despite available treatment with medications and lifestyle changes, blood pressure remains uncontrolled for many patients. Nearly 80% of adults with hypertension do not have it under control1 and half of hypertension patients become non-adherent to medication within one year.2About RDN The Medtronic Symplicity Spyral™ renal denervation (RDN) system uses a minimally invasive procedure that delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy to specific nerves near the kidneys that can become overactive and cause high blood pressure. Approved for commercial use in 70 countries around the world, the Symplicity Spyral Renal Denervation System is currently limited to investigational use in the U.S., Japan, and Canada.About MedtronicBold thinking.

The chairperson of the panel then had to break the tie to vote against the device.Separately, while all panel members voted the device was safe to use, 6 of 13 voted against its effectiveness.The panel's recommendations are not binding, but are usually followed by the FDA.""We appreciate the robust conversation that occurred prior to the vote,"" Jason Weidman, senior vice president and president of the Coronary and Renal Denervation business, Medtronic, said in a statement, adding, the company will continue to collaborate with the FDA on bringing a new option.Japan-based Otsuka Holdings' unit ReCor's device was shown to provide a benefit in lowering blood pressure in clinical trials. Medtronic's device helped to lower blood pressure at the doctor's clinic but not at home, which is considered a more accurate measure of blood pressure monitoring.Medtronic and the FDA's staff reviewers said before the meeting that additional analyses of the data showed the difference could be due to factors such as use of more drugs by patients treated with a ""sham"" procedure.The company was seeking the health regulator's nod for the device indicated for patients whose hypertension, or high blood pressure, cannot be controlled with drugs.The surgery, which is allowed in Europe and other parts of the world, is not approved in the U.S., after initial studies of older devices used in the procedure failed key studies, and several companies dropped out of the race to develop them.

Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 28, 2023, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the executive VPs from each of our four segments will join us, and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company.15 African Countries with the Best Doctors15 African Countries with the Best DoctorsToday's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC. And we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and first quarter revenue in the current and prior year reported as other, which stems from prior business operations. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the second calendar quarter of 2023 compared to the second calendar quarter of 2022 unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.Story continuesWith that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter.Geoff Martha: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with the strong start of our fiscal year. We executed and delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Our solid results were broad-based with each of our four segments delivering 6% growth driven by execution, innovation, and much improved underlying fundamentals in our markets and supply chain. We also continue to make great strides on our comprehensive transformation which is designed to get at the root of what has held back our growth. We're executing large-scale functional improvements to global operations, supply chain and quality. And we're also decisively allocating capital, particularly to our programs and fast secular growth markets as well as focusing our R&amp;D investments on technology megatrends like robotics and artificial intelligence that will drive growth in our industry over the next decade.And at the same time, we remain focused on our ongoing portfolio management efforts. And taken together, we expect this continued focus on executing our transformation will ensure durable top and bottom-line growth and create value for our shareholders. So let's turn now to the details of our Q1 results. We had another strong quarter of growth from our largest businesses. Cranial and Spinal, Surgical and Cardiac Rhythm, these businesses have durable established leadership positions. And combined, they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 6% organic. Starting with Cranial and Spinal technologies, we had another great quarter, growing 6% globally and 8% in the US, driven by our market-leading Aible ecosystem. We're seeing growth in both neurosurgery capital equipment and the associated pull-through of our best-in-class spinal implants and biologics as surgeons continue to adopt Aible.Neurosurgery grew 5%, including double-digit growth in Mazor robotics and high-single-digit growth in StealthStation navigation. And Spine and Biologics grew 7% globally and 9% in the US. These results demonstrate our successful strategy of offering surgeons a differentiated and innovative ecosystem including our AI-enabled surgical planning platform and patient-specific customized implants, along with imaging, navigation and robotic technologies. Now moving to Surgical, we grew 7%. Supply continued to improve and this drove high-single-digit growth in Advanced Surgical Technologies. And we had particular strength in Advanced Energy as we continue the rollout of our LigaSure XP and cordless Sonicision 7. Cardiac rhythm grew 5% with Mid-single-digit growth in defibrillation solutions diagnostics and Cardiac Pacing.And now within Pacing, we had strong mid-teens growth in our Micra leadless pacemaker franchise and we launched our next-generation Microdevices AV2 and VR2 in the US. These tiny 0.8 CC devices have a battery life of 16 and 17 years, respectively, 40% longer than our previous generation and well beyond average battery life of competing products. We're also seeing EPs rapidly adopt conduction system pacing as an alternative to traditional single or dual-chamber pacing. Our 3830 lead is the only one approved for conduction system pacing in the US and it grew 45% in the quarter. Looking ahead, we're preparing to launch the Aurora EV-ICD later this year. Aurora is a game changer for the ICD space. It delivers the benefits of a traditional ICD including the same size, longevity and pacing features, but without leads in the heart or veins.Turning to our synergistic businesses. There were several notable performances this quarter. Cardiac Surgery grew 8% again this quarter, with strength in perfusion and cannula. Our Aortic and ENT businesses both grew double digits, driven in part by improved product availability. Peripheral Vascular grew mid-single digits with low double-digit growth in drug-coated balloons and high single-digit growth in superficial vein therapy. Neuromodulation grew mid-single digits in both Pain Stim and Brain Modulation, driven by new implants of Intellis with DTM and Percept PC with BrainSense. And just last week, we received CE Mark approval for our next-generation spinal cord stimulator, Inceptiv, which will be available in Europe in the coming months.Inceptiv incorporates closed-loop therapy with ECAPs, the result of decades of Medtronic R&amp;D, to unlock the ability to listen and respond to signals along the spinal cord. Both our largest and synergistic businesses had really strong quarters. And our businesses that compete in high secular growth med-tech markets, they did as well. All combined, these businesses made up 20% of our revenue and grew in the high single digits in Q1. We continue to disproportionately invest in these businesses, and we expect them to become a larger part of our revenue mix and be large contributors to our durable growth in the future. Starting with Structural Heart, transcatheter valves grew 11% globally, including 12% growth in the US and 21% growth in Japan. We continue to see improvements in the TAVR space and adoption of our differentiated Evolut FX valve.Evolut FX combines enhanced and predictable valve deployment with industry-leading durability. And next Monday, we're looking forward to the presentation of the NOTION 10-year data at ESC, which will look at the durability of the CoreValve and Evolut valves compared to surgery over a decade. In Neurovascular, we grew mid-single digits when you exclude China where the market is subject to volume-based procurement. Global growth was fueled by continued strength in flow diversion. We're seeing strong adoption of our Shield technology for treating aneurysms, which is available on our Pipeline Flex and Pipeline Vantage flow diverters. And Cardiac Ablation Solutions grew 5%. And as you know, Pulse Field Ablation has become one of the most anticipated technologies in medtech.And we will be leading the way in bringing PFA catheters to market for both focal and single-shot segments. We're continuing the limited market release in Europe for Affera mapping and ablation system, including our Sphere-9 focal catheter. Sphere-9 can perform both PFA and RF ablation and delivers high-density mapping, all from the same catheter. Turning to our single-shot PFA catheter, PulseSelect, we filed for approval with US FDA and expect to be one of the first companies with a PFA catheter in the US market. With our PFA catheters and the Affera map nav system, combined with our leading Arctic Front crowd solution and differentiated AcQCross Transseptal Access System, we're poised to become a more meaningful player in the fast-growing $8 billion EP ablation space.In Robotic Surgical Technologies, we increased our installed base as we continue the international rollout of our differentiated Hugo robotic system. And we've activated new sites in our EXPAND URO US pivotal trial which continues to progress to plan. We expect Hugo to be a meaningful growth driver for us in the years ahead, given its differentiated value proposition, our leading position in minimally invasive surgery and the low penetration of robotic surgery around the world. And in Diabetes, we had a good quarter as we continued to see very strong demand for the MiniMed 780G AID system in markets around the world. 780G is a true second-generation AID system and is the only one with five-minute adjustments in auto corrections and Meal Detection technology.We're getting great feedback that users are feeling a difference within one to two days. And our real-world evidence indicates that 90% of users are achieving or exceeding their glycemic targets when using our recommended settings as well as getting burden reduction in their diabetes management. And this differentiated value proposition is showing up in our results. Non-US developed markets grew 18%, our highest growth in four years, driven by both 780G adoption and increased CGM attachment rates. And in the US, we're seeing great results and momentum from the 780G launch. First, the launch drove low 30s growth in our US durable pump sales. Second, we're seeing our prescriber base rapidly expand. Since we last talked to you at ADA in late June, we've had a 30% increase in unique prescribers with now over 13,000 since launch.Third, we've had over half of our 770G installed base upgrade or place an order for the 780G since launch. And not only is demand coming from our existing installed base, but we're also getting competitive conversions. And finally, we're seeing very high CGM attachment rates in the 780G installed base, which will drive our economics and gives us confidence in accelerating growth. So the turnaround in Diabetes is real and underway, and I am pleased with the progress the team is making. And we're just at the beginning of this inflection point for the business. As we shared with you at our ADA investor briefing in June, we see the intensive insulin space moving from primarily standalone CGM today to one that is smart dosing through either AID systems or smart MDI, and we are well positioned for this trend.We continue to invest heavily in next-generation durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors and algorithms with multiple programs under development. And importantly, we're the only company assembling this complete ecosystem of differentiated technology for people living with diabetes. With that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and our fiscal '24 guidance raise. Karen?Karen Parkhill: Thanks, Geoff. As Geoff mentioned, we had a strong start to our fiscal year with 6% revenue growth coming in ahead of expectations. We also had good growth on the bottom line with non-GAAP EPS of $1.20, up 6%. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our guidance range, with $0.07 coming from better-than-expected operational performance and $0.02 from FX. We're focused on positioning Medtronic to drive durable growth. You've seen that over the last several quarters on the top line, and as we talked about on our last call, stabilizing and then ultimately improving gross margins remains a priority for us. The breadth of our revenue growth this quarter is notable. As Geoff mentioned, each of our four business segments grew 6%.And by geography, non-US developed and emerging markets, both grew in the high single digits with the US growing mid-single digits. Western Europe grew 8% again this quarter with high single-digit growth in Cardiovascular and Medical Surgical and high teens growth in Diabetes. Emerging markets grew 8% and were affected by new sanctions in Russia and ongoing VBP impact in China. That said, China growth at 4% was better than expected given some provincial VBP delays to later in the year and strong procedure recovery. Excluding China and Russia, emerging markets grew in the high teens with mid-teens growth in Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa and high-teens growth in Latin America and South Asia. Turning to margins. Our adjusted gross margin was relatively stable year-over-year and ahead of expectations with better-than-expected pricing and less-than-expected impact from currency, offsetting inflationary pressures.Our operating margin increased 90 basis points, driven by revenue outperformance and our focus on expense management, particularly in our G&amp;A line. Below the operating profit line, our adjusted nominal tax rate was 15.8%, above expectations, driven by a change in Puerto Rico tax law. The change drove an approximate 120 basis point increase in our tax line, offset by a corresponding decrease in other operating expense. So the change was net neutral to earnings. Turning to capital allocation. We're prioritizing investments in innovation as we disproportionately invest in high-growth, high-return opportunities. We do this through multiple channels, including organic R&amp;D, minority investments, strategic partnerships and disciplined acquisitions.At the same time, we prioritize returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend. We also continue to advance our active portfolio management. Last quarter, we moved our Renal Care Solutions business into a joint venture with DaVita. We've been focused on the separation of Patient Monitoring and Respiratory Interventions. And as we noted in our 10-K, we now expect to complete the separation in the first half of next fiscal year, if not sooner, as we've been evaluating different types of transactions to maximize shareholder value. We've always said a spin sets a high bar, and it remains the likely way we'll separate these businesses. Now turning to guidance. With our outperformance in the first quarter and improved underlying fundamentals, we're raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance.We now expect fiscal '24 organic revenue growth of 4.5%, an increase from the prior range of 4% to 4.5%. This guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our new Other segment, and I direct you to the guidance slide in our earnings presentation for additional details. In the second quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. On a comp-adjusted basis, this represents an acceleration over the first quarter. And we expect a steady acceleration in underlying growth in the back half of the year as well. While the impact of currency is fluid, based on recent rates, foreign currency would have a neutral impact on full year revenue, including a favorable impact of $85 million to $135 million in the second quarter.Moving down the P&amp;L. As we have said before, we expect inflation and currency pressures this fiscal year. And we do expect some of the delayed impact from the provincial VBPs that benefited us in the first quarter to come later in the year. However, you are beginning to see the results from the actions we are taking to drive structural changes in our global operations and supply chain. To give a few examples, we're moving to fewer, more strategic suppliers that are giving us better terms. And we're implementing improvements to run our factories more efficiently and reliably. There is more to come, and we expect this will drive stabilization in our gross margin over time and then improve it from there. On the bottom line, we're raising our fiscal '24 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to the new range of $5.08 to $5.16, an increase from the prior range of $5.00 to $5.10.This is a $0.07 increase at the midpoint, in line with the first quarter operational beat. The guidance range continues to include an unfavorable 6% impact from foreign currency based on recent rates. The projected 6% annual FX impact is unchanged from May as the $0.02 of FX upside in the first quarter is now offset later in the year. For the second quarter, we expect EPS of $1.16 to $1.20, including a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency based on recent rates. Before sending it back to Geoff, I'd like to acknowledge our employees who are watching today. I truly appreciate your focus on driving change to execute well and deliver on our priorities. It is that focus that contributes to these results and fulfills our enduring mission to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of patients around the globe.Thank you. Back to you, Geoff.Geoff Martha: Okay. Thank you, Karen. Now before we go to the analyst questions, I'll close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was a strong start to our year and we're establishing a track record of delivering dependable mid-single digit growth. We're executing and bringing innovation in the market. We're making progress in countering the impacts that inflation and currency are having on our margins. And we expect this to lead to stabilization and then improvement over time. We're also seeing improved underlying fundamentals in our supply chain and in our markets, across our businesses and geographies. And like I said earlier, we're at the beginning of an inflection point in our Diabetes business and we're seeing strength in our established market-leading businesses like CRM and Spine.And with our pipeline, we have several important growth catalysts that we expect to come to market over the coming quarters. So we're on the right path and building momentum. And underneath all of this, what may be less visible to you are the steps we've taken to transform the company, tackling the root causes of what have made our growth less dependable in the past. We're ensuring a performance-driven culture, partially driven by a number of new leaders in the company. We're advancing our capital allocation and portfolio management priorities to take advantage of high-growth opportunities. And we're executing on the programs that we believe will lead to scale advantages, whether that's in our now centralized global operations and supply chain organization or in how we go to market with large enterprise customers around the world or in how we're leveraging core technologies and implementing new innovations across our businesses.Now to accelerate this last area, we created a new position of Chief Technology and Innovation Officer and hired Ken Washington this past quarter to fill that role. Ken was recently at Amazon, where he led consumer robotics, and before that, was Chief Technology Officer at Ford Motor Company and VP of the Advanced Technology Center at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. I look forward to sharing more details in the quarters ahead on how Ken is leading our efforts to leverage technologies like robotics and AI across the enterprise, which we believe will lead to new, differentiated therapies for patients and better experiences for our customers. So this is an extensive transformation. Yes, there's still work to be done, but you're seeing some of the benefits in our results.And you should expect to see more of this over time as we continue to work toward delivering durable revenue and earnings growth, which, combined with a growing dividend, is a winning formula for creating value for our shareholders. Now let's move to Q&amp;A where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. So we ask you to limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. I also want to note that today is the first time we have Mike Marinaro, who runs our Surgical and our Endoscopy businesses joining us for the Q&amp;A. Now Bob White's focus is on the PMRI businesses as we separate, which is a heavy lift.And we have Mike focused on the other two MedSurg businesses. So today, if you have questions on Surgical or Endoscopy, direct them to Mike. And PMRI questions can go to Bob. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?A - Brad Welnick: [Operator Instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&amp;A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Surgical and Endoscopy businesses; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio; Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience portfolio; and Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio. We’ll pause for a few second to assemble the queue. We'll take the first question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead.See also 25 Most Physically Active Countries in the World and Long-Term Returns of Carl Icahn's 40 Activist Targets.Q&amp;A SessionVijay Kumar: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. And, Geoff, congrats on good print here, good execution. Maybe my first one on Diabetes here. The 30% US growth numbers here, I think that's a revenue number. Do you know what the comp growth number was in US and how much of this was existing customers? How much of this growth is grown by existing customers upgrading the 770G users update versus new customer adds?Geoff Martha: Thanks, Vijay, for the question. Yeah. Well, first of all, let me just say we're really pleased with the momentum we have in Diabetes. I mean and I think we're on the kind of early stages of a growth acceleration there. We're seeing great outcomes in patients. Like I mentioned in the commentary, a significant increase in unique prescribers, a much higher attachment rate of CGM, which will really impact our economics. That's where a lot of the profit comes from. And we think this is durable and in line with the market trends of time and range and moving to automated insulin delivery. So -- and we've got a nice pipeline coming down the path as well. But to answer those specific questions, I'm going to turn to Que, as you know, who runs that business. Que, do you want to touch on Vijay's specific questions?Que Dallara: Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Thanks, Vijay. We're really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the US so far. In terms of what's driving the low 30s AID growth in the US, it's both our existing installed base of 770G users that have upgraded. We've had more than 50% of that cohort upgrade or in the process of upgrading. But we're also seeing growth coming from new patients. We've had the highest new patient growth in three years and that's coming from MDI as well as competitive switches.Vijay Kumar: That’s helpful, Que. Maybe, Geoff, I have 1 quick follow up. A lot of questions here on China. The new anticorruption campaign, we're seeing some headlines, a lot of questions on how this would impact device companies. Maybe just talk about at a high level what you're seeing in China? What was the VBP impact in the quarter? And any signs of perhaps the channel pausing here because of this new antifriction campaign? Thank you.Geoff Martha: Yeah, you asked about the anticorruption and VBP so -- in China. So look, on the anticorruption, I recognize that there are concerns out there. And we're actively monitoring the situation, which is fluid in nature. But I'll say thus far, we're not seeing any material headwind for our business. And it is kind of pivoting to -- there's a linkage to VBP. It's worth noting that we -- you can argue that we're somewhat a bit insulated from some of this anticorruption with the coverage under VBPs, I mean, volume, in this case, is contracted. And with the hospital pricing is determined with VBP and we're less reliant on the field team and distribution, which has also allowed us to take cost out to mitigate the price impact.So no impact at this point from the anticorruption campaign that you read about. And then regarding VBP, I mean this -- it's -- we feel it's been -- it's a 2.5-year kind of impact here and we're -- for us, that fully -- that impact kind of fully takes effect in this fiscal year, FY '24. It's all in our guidance. As Karen pointed out in the commentary, the China growth this past quarter was at 4%, which is slightly higher than we expected, still well below what it used to be, but -- and where we think it's going to get back. As we kind of lap this -- these last couple of VBP areas in FY '24, we expect this revenue to get back to historical high single-digit, low double-digit growth for us. So hope that answers the question. This is something, as you look forward, it's a multibillion dollar of revenue for the company that over the last couple of years has been negative, more recently flat, now starting to get positive.And as we -- as we get out of FY '24, again, we expect a tick up in this growth. So that's coming.Vijay Kumar: Got you. Thanks.Ryan Weispfenning: Yeah. Thanks for the questions, Vijay. We’ll take the next question please, Brad?Brad Welnick: The next question comes from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead.Robbie Marcus: Great, good morning. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe to start for Geoff or Karen, as we think about guidance for the rest of the year, you raised the organic sales growth from the low end of 4% to 4.5% up to 4.5%. You did 6% in the first quarter. So maybe just walk us through why growth is going to decelerate for the rest of the year? And what are some of the factors affecting what could drive you above that? Thanks.Karen Parkhill: Yeah. Thanks for that question, Robbie. Appreciate it. Q1 was a really great start to our year, and we're really pleased with the breadth of our performance. As Geoff mentioned, it's the third consecutive quarter that we've had of solid mid-single digit growth. And we're carrying the beat that we had in Q1 and raising our Q2 guide to 4% to 4.5%. And all of that puts our FY '24 guidance at 4.5%. It's still early in the year, and we're focused on providing guidance that sets us up for success. I've talked about some of the puts and takes that we've got. We're a little more optimistic on China, Geoff talked about it. We've had procedure volume recovery. We also had some of the VBP impacts that we expected in the first quarter delayed into the -- later in the fiscal year.And we're expecting Russia to be a bigger drag given the new sanctions that were put in place in late May. But we're focused on offsetting that just as we did in Q1, and we feel good about the improved underlying fundamentals. And we're intensely focused on hitting our commitments. Just on the acceleration for the rest of the year, on a comp-adjusted basis, Q2 represents an acceleration from Q1. And then we expect continued acceleration into the back half each quarter of the fiscal year into the back half. So hopefully, that answers your question.Robbie Marcus: Yeah. Great. Thank you. Maybe just one more on margins. Margin expansion or the upside in the quarter came from gross margin. SG&amp;A, I know you had some reductions in the head count. So as we just try and think about operating margins for this year and going forward, how should we think about how much more there is to come out of SG&amp;A and how much more upside there is in gross margin moving back towards where we were pre-COVID? Thanks a lot.Karen Parkhill: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Clearly, we're focused on driving margin expansion and ultimately on the gross margin getting back to pre-COVID levels over time. We saw improved margins this quarter, and we're increasing our full year guidance on gross margin expectations given some of that outperformance. But in Q1, we did have some better-than-expected currency and pricing. And some of that was due to timing with some provincial tenders in China being delayed a bit and some of the FX improvement that we saw this quarter, we expect to -- FX to impact us a little bit more in the back half of the year. So as we think about margins, we are making investments in our global operations and supply chain to drive cost out of the organization.And I mentioned a couple of examples where we're consolidating our suppliers and focused on improvements in our manufacturing operations to drive continued improvement. And over time, we're focused on stabilizing and improving our margins. And so that will continue to impact us on the operating margin line. And on SG&amp;A, as you mentioned, we're focused on continuing to drive leverage in our SG&amp;A line, as you've seen us do for a long period of time.Ryan Weispfenning: Okay. Thank you, Robbie. We’ll take the next question please, Brad.Brad Welnick: The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead.Larry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two for Sean, given the upcoming events here with the Symplicity adcom and then the Affera pulse data this weekend. Sean, how are you feeling about the Simplicity panel tomorrow? And if we see a positive recommendation, help us think about timelines for approval and the ramp in the US for renal denervation. And second, we're going to see the Affera pulse data this weekend as well. You guys are growing mid-single digits, looks like a little bit below the market right now. What should we be looking for in the Affera pulse data? And how are you feeling about being able to grow your AFib business at or above the market going forward? Thank you.Sean Salmon: Thanks for the question, Larry. So I guess starting with the adcom panel. Obviously, we've been very confident about the prospects of US approval, and we're exclusively well prepared for that panel. I'm not going to handicap the timing, but typically, it's three to four months post panel recommendation, you tend to see things. Let's say, an approval in the second half of fiscal year '24 is certainly in order with that kind of timing. And the ramp itself, of course, is going to be dictated by the pace of reimbursement and we're well prepared on that front as well. As far as our pulse field ablation, we're looking forward to seeing the results like everyone else's. This is a randomized trial, as you know. So that comparative efficacy compared to both cryo and RF ablation for the populations being studied and will be of interest to us.And I think our distinction really in pulse field is that we are the only player that has both a focal solution as well as an anatomic solution in the bag. The anatomic solution or single-shot market is about 15% of the market. And the other 85% is what the point-by-point ablation will bring to us. So certainly very confident in both technologies, both the PulseSelect and Affera mapping and Sphere-9 catheter system, which is very different than everything else that's out there, and we look forward to bringing those to customers all around the world.Larry Biegelsen: All right. Thank you.Ryan Weispfenning: Thanks, Larry. Next question please, Brad.Brad Welnick: The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy at UBS. Danielle, please go ahead.Danielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And congrats, this was quite a good quarter. Just a quick question on GLP-1s, Geoff. I know this is probably an annoying question for you, but this is something that's been impacting the market broadly. And just curious, you guys touched on many, many areas within medical devices. How are you guys thinking about the impact of GLP-1s over the next -- I would say even a few years, but maybe let's focus on more the next year as these drugs get more readily adopted.Geoff Martha: Sure. Thanks, Danielle, for the comments and the question. And yeah, it is interesting. First of all, I'd say it's an important class of drugs and like you were monitoring to see how the GLP-1 therapy is being adopted. That said, our initial work indicates minimal impact to our business. When you -- bariatric -- the one area we've seen some modest impact is bariatric, but this is really a small impact and this is a relatively small part of our Surgery business. And we are hearing from -- the work we do is our internal analysis plus dialogue that we're having with physicians around the world. We actually operate obesity clinics in Europe as well. And they're talking about, longer term, this could actually bring in the bariatric space more patients into the funnel.Short term, we've seen some impact, again, modest and bariatric is a relatively small part of our surgery business. Longer term, we'll see how it plays out. There's a bit of optimism there though. No impact in Type 1 diabetes, which is the vast majority of our Diabetes business. And this is overall, I just don't see GLP-1s having a material impact on our business and medical device therapies at large. That's what our work is showing us at this point.Danielle Antalffy: And then I guess just one quick follow-up to that, thinking about, again, the diabetes business. Type 2 is a big growth area. You guys have an AID pen. So what are your thoughts specifically on the Type 2 diabetes side of things? Thanks so much.Geoff Martha: Thanks. Look, I think this is AID for insulin-dependent patients, whether they're Type 2 or Type 1 is pretty under-penetrated. And we see way more upside there than headwinds.Ryan Weispfenning: Thanks, Danielle. We’ll take the next question please, Brad.Brad Welnick: The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead.Travis Steed: Hey, congrats on a good quarter. I guess I'll ask about TAVR, double-digit growth this quarter. And curious how much success you've had with the new valve versus the five-year data. I know your competitor is going to have five-year data pretty soon. And then the 21% Japan growth really stood out. Just curious if that's sustainable or that was more of a one-off in the quarter?Geoff Martha: Well, first, before I turn it over -- before I turn it over to Sean, we are -- if you go back the last couple of quarters, we are pleased with how our TAVR business is performing relative to competition and how the new valve is performing and also the pipeline for the future. But Sean, why don't you give the specifics on that question?Sean Salmon: Sure. Hey, Travis, the new valve is certainly being well received where we've launched it. It's been launched in the United States and a number of other geographies and Japan notably. The other thing that drove Japan growth was that we got a new indication for end-stage renal disease, which is something we've been lacking in Japan. So it's a large consideration for that population that really helps drive the performance. But yes, our long-term data have been really the signature of that device, and we'll see more of that this coming weekend as well as the 10-year NOTION data. This is the first 10-year data being reported out for TAVR will be on display. And then of course, we have four-year data coming up on our low-risk study as well to look forward to this fall.So we stand behind the valve performance all the way around. And whether it's the acute ease of use or the long-term durability of the valve, it's really shining and we're getting a lot of traction from all of that.Travis Steed: That's helpful. And then the PMRI spend, I assume the time change is more because spends take longer than sells. But maybe some other comments on when we could see the Form 10, can you confirm the operating margin profile of that business is still kind of slightly higher than overall Medtronic? And then do we need to wait for this to get through to see more on the portfolio management side of things? Thank you.Karen Parkhill: Yeah. Thanks, Travis. I think there's nothing to read into this other than we're focused on maximizing shareholder value, and we've been taking our time to evaluate the alternatives. And we've said all along that the spin sets a high bar and that remains a likely way that we'll separate. And so we'll -- we're expecting to close it first half of next fiscal year, if not sooner. In terms of Form 10, we'll -- you'll see it when you see it. And in terms of the margins of the business, yes, they are good margins and slightly higher than the company. Hopefully, that helps.Geoff Martha: And the business continues to perform well. Like Karen said, the margin profile has remained strong. And actually, the competitive dynamics, particularly in the patient monitoring side of it, have probably improved a bit in our favor. So it's a good business, and I think with more focus, I think these numbers can even improve.Travis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot.Ryan Weispfenning: Thanks, Travis. Next question please, Brad.Brad Welnick: The next question comes from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead.Matt Miksic: Hi, thanks so much [Technical Difficulty] question and congrats on a really strong quarter across the board. There's a lot to talk about, but maybe one question on diabetes for Que and then one follow-up. So just would love to hear how things are progressing with some of the programs that you talked about at ADA, the next-gen sensor and integrated testing and the patch pump that you're in the process of acquiring here? And then if I could on that, Geoff mentioned something about the next-gen AID pump and I know it's way early to even ask the question, but just curious if you are ready to share any hints about that? And then one quick follow-up, if I could.Que Dallara: Yeah. Thanks for your questions. As you know, [indiscernible] CGM, our next generation CGM is under review with the marketing FDA. We're in the process of doing that, and it's very difficult to put a precise time line on when we expect to have approval, but that is progressing. In terms of the integration with 780G, we have completed adult enrollment for the clinical trial in Q1. We expect to complete the peds enrollment in. But that's at the clinical trial stage. We're also -- in terms of the patch, we're making progress there as well in terms of completing that transaction, and we expect that we would close out the EOFlow acquisition at the end of at the end of this calendar year. And again, very sorry to disappoint you, but difficult to comment on our further programs. They're progressing as we expect in our internal time lines. But at this stage, it's a bit too early to put details on specific timing.Matt Miksic: That's helpful and understandable. Just one -- the follow-up is on sort of seasonality. You've seen July year and I know there's been a number of questions across the sector, given what we've seen over the last [Technical Difficulty] year-to-date in surgeries and procedure volumes and so on. Just any sense of what kind of summer quarter we should expect, which for you [Technical Difficulty] August, but softer than usual, seasonally normal. How would you describe what you've seen in July and what your expectations are built into your fiscal Q2 here? Thanks.Karen Parkhill: So I would just say, Travis, that the first few weeks of the quarter and what we've seen in July are tracking well. We continue to have strength in the underlying performance and it's tracking of the expectations we set in our guidance.Matt Miksic: That’s fair. All right, thanks so much.Ryan Weispfenning: Thanks, Matt. We’ll take the next question please, Brad.Brad Welnick: The next question comes from Chris Pasquale at Nephron. Chris, please go ahead.Chris Pasquale: Hey. Geoff, one for you and then a quick follow-up for Karen. You mentioned artificial intelligence as one of the areas Medtronic is investing in. It's obviously a hot topic in the market more broadly. Could you provide any examples of the work you guys are doing there? Maybe talk about which businesses you see AI as being most relevant for in the near future?Geoff Martha: Sure. Well, first of all, I think for the medical device industry, the kind of the intersection of traditional biomedical engineering with these digital technologies, whether it be connectivity or data analytics techniques like AI and deep learning, robotics, these are all just a huge opportunity for the industry. This is -- and these are areas that we intend to lead in. AI specifically, we've got a number of businesses that have first-of-their-kind, AI-powered solutions that have received regulatory approval by the FDA and other regulatory bodies around the world. And what we're seeing here is just improved -- from the AI is just improved outcomes and access. And it's the -- when you combine the AI with good data, not just quantity, but the quality of data and that data is labeled properly, we're seeing the ability to even personal -- like evolve and improve the efficacy over time through the AI and even personalize it.The FDA has approved a couple of products for us in the Cardiac Rhythm space, in Spine, in GI, where you have like what they call a predetermined change control plan where you're allowed to kind of improve that efficacy over time. And some of the businesses that are impacted, like I mentioned, our GI are now calling Endoscopy space, where we have AI in the colonoscopy, you're kind of redefining traditional colonoscopies where the AI is finding polyps that physicians were missing. And this is a significant amount of polyps and it's obviously good for patient outcomes because there's a high correlation to cancer -- colon cancer from these polyps and it's also economically aligned with the hospital's interest as you find more polyps and remove them.Another area is in our Spine business. This is an industry that's being completely redefined by enabling technology -- transformed and redefined by enabling technology. And we talk about robotics and imaging and navigation and powered instruments, but AI is a key piece of this and we have thousands of surgeries in our AI -- that’s powering our AI algorithm. And with each -- and Spine is a complicated surgery, especially whether it be degen, or [for sure] (ph), deformity complex cases. Highly reliant on surgeon training. And the AI is really just improving outcomes here, especially when it's combined with enabling technology. I could go on, cardiac rhythm in our monitoring, our LINQ monitoring business there, we are cutting down false positives for -- in detecting AFib by 50% using AI, and that's creating multiple hours of productivity for these clinics around the country and given -- so and this really driving the deployment of that technology.So I'd say it's a huge opportunity. It's a differentiator. I mentioned we hired a new head of technology, Ken Washington, to really help us scale this across all our businesses and better partner with some big tech companies. We've talked about our partnership with NVIDIA. And in the end, I'd say what we're going to see over the next couple of years is you may not be replacing -- AI is not going to be replacing surgeons, but I'll tell you what, surgeons who use AI will be replacing surgeons that don't and we are going to be right in the middle of that mix.Chris Pasquale: Thanks. Those are great examples. Karen, you mentioned price as a contributor to the gross margin strength in the quarter. Could you just give us a sense for what price looks like across the company today? Maybe how it compares to where you were a couple of years ago? And if you think that it's sustainable as we move into a less inflationary environment going forward?Karen Parkhill: Yes. Thanks for the question. As you've heard us talk about, we have been building a pretty strong muscle around pricing. And we're focused on ensuring that we price for the value that we deliver. Typically, historically, pre-COVID, we would experience up to 200 basis points of pricing pressure every year. And we've been able to neutralize that these last couple of years, including this quarter. We obviously have had VBP pressure this year, and last year, we were able to neutralize that as well at the total company level. By quarter, it may not be fully neutralized depending on how VBP hits us. But we do believe that this pricing muscle that we've built is going to be lasting. And we fully intend to continue to track, monitor, talk about pricing, so that even as we move into a lower inflationary environment, we're focused on continuing this pricing muscle that we've built.Geoff Martha: I just want to reemphasize that last point there on kind of -- we'll start on margins. On gross margins, and there was a question earlier, Karen went into detail, I'm not going to repeat that. But on gross margins, the pricing muscle that we've been building. I think we intend that to be enduring. And then Karen mentioned the cost of goods sold improvements that we're making, productivity around our cost of goods sold line, really driven by our new structure, strategy and capabilities in our global operations and supply chain. That will all help gross margin. And as you get down the P&amp;L, we're really focused on getting leverage from SG&amp;A and excited about stabilizing and then improving the margins over time.Ryan Weispfenning: Okay. Thanks Chris. We’ll take the next question please, Brad.Brad Welnick: The next question comes from Jayson Bedford at Raymond James. Jayson, please go ahead.Jayson Bedford: Good morning. Can you hear me okay?Geoff Martha: Yeah, Jayson. We can hear you.Jayson Bedford: All right. Thanks. So not to make this a call all around gross margin, but I did have a question. You mentioned stabilization. I just wanted to put a little context around that. What is the expected gross margin for fiscal '24?Karen Parkhill: At this point -- when we gave our guidance back in May, we said we expected it to be around 65.25%. And at this point, we're expecting it to be about 65.50%. We've seen some improvement in the first quarter, and we're carrying some of that through.Jayson Bedford: Okay. And just, Karen, the drop down for the rest of the year versus first quarter levels, revenue is higher. Is this just strictly a function of the VBP impact hitting more in the back half?Karen Parkhill: Yes, it's both VBP and currency. And you're right, higher revenue growth clearly helps on the margin front. But we have seen some timing on VBP that we talked about. We also have some timing on FX. It was a little bit better than we expected down the P&amp;L in the first quarter, and we expect to give some of that back as we look at the currency impact going forward.Jayson Bedford: Thank you.Ryan Weispfenning: Thanks, Jayson. Brad, I think we have time for two more questions.Brad Welnick: The next question comes from Joanne Weunsch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead.Joanne Weunsch: Good morning. And thank you very much for taking the question and nice quarter or nice way to start the fiscal year. Two quick questions. Volumes, we've seen throughout medtech this season have been quite strong, which leads me to wonder as to sort of a new normalized base or whether or not we're just catching up on some pent-up demand. I'd love your opinion on that. And then for Hugo, you talked about activating new sites in the United States. Can you give us maybe an update on the thoughts on timing of a launch in the US? And then anything else you can add for OUS robotic placements would be appreciated. Thank you.Geoff Martha: Sure, Joanne. Yeah, good to hear from you. Thanks for the questions. I'll take the first one, and then I'll turn it over to Mike Marinaro to handle the Hugo questions. I think on procedure trends, we're -- as Karen mentioned, I mentioned in the commentary, they're definitely improved, and I'll start in the US where we're up about 5% or so. But across the board, we're seeing very good procedural trends, and we're largely back to pre-COVID or better. pre-COVID levels are better. As you know, over the last, I don't know, 18 months or so, the rebound has been, I'd say, held back a bit by staffing issues and those have seem to have abated. And like I said, we're getting pretty broad-based procedural pickups and are back to pre-COVID or even better levels.And outside of the US, I'd say it's even stronger. In Western Europe, high single digits. The recovery in Europe is definitely in full swing. Latin America, high teens. And just our -- like our emerging market base when you got to pull out -- if you pull out China, which is VBP, like I said before, this is -- we see the kind of the stabilizing year here for VBP FY '24. And then as you get into FY '25, you get back to some higher growth in China like we've seen before. But if you take out China and Russia with the sanctions, we're in the teens -- the mid-teens and -- high teens actually in emerging markets. So emerging markets trends are strong. I mentioned Latin America as a standout, Western Europe. So pretty good trends. We're not seeing like this -- at least in the areas we're in, I've heard some area like orthopedics, there's been a pent-up demand.But we're not seeing it in the areas we're in. It's been a steady flow versus like a pent-up demand. So I think that's good news for the industry. On the Hugo questions, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Marinaro, who runs our Surgical business, which includes Hugo and also our endoscopy or formerly called GI business reports up to him as well.Mike Marinaro: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Joanne. And specifically on the US, we did comment that we added sites in the quarter, and that's true we had sites and enrollment and continue to progress according to plan in our EXPAND URO study. We're pleased with the progress we're making there and seeing that progress continue here as we've moved into this quarter. More broadly, we've seen good progress really and continue to be encouraged about the progress we're making across the program. We're now selling in five regions around the globe. Greater China, Asia, Western Europe, LatAm, North America and Canada. And increased our installations again here in this quarter. I think importantly, we've also seen an increasing flow or a steady flow of increasing indication approvals.So we received the general surgery indication in Japan. And so now we have a full suite of approvals across general surgery, gynecology and urology in both Japan and Western Europe, which are two of the largest markets around the globe. Of course, US is the largest and that's one we remain incredibly focused on. Overall, we're seeing that the growth here in Hugo is contributing to the growth we've seen now in the Surgical business across the last couple of quarters, and it will become a more and more important part of our business as we move forward.Geoff Martha: Yeah, really look -- excited about the setup we have for our business. It's a very large business for us that where the supply capacity has been an issue, that's in a much better spot. The robots out there might just walk through kind of indication expansion and geographic expansion and update on the US trial. And I like the set up and the competitive dynamics going forward over the next couple of years. We got two major competitors, one with robot, one without. And we're feeling pretty good about where we are with Surgery.Ryan Weispfenning: Thanks, Joanne. I still see a number of people in the queue, and I apologize that we won't be able to get to all of you today, given timing. We've got time for one more question, please, Brad.Brad Welnick: Our final question comes from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley. Patrick, please go ahead.Patrick Wood: Fabulous. Thank you so much. I'll keep it to one given the timing. S&amp;OP and supply chain is obviously not a very sexy topic, but you guys are doing a lot of work on that side. I'm just curious, typically, when we put processes and rationalization in place, there's kind of upfront cost and like your dual running systems and it's kind of difficult for people to transition. Are you seeing any slight -- let's say, short-term challenges or costs associated with that, where the payback is obviously going to come in the next, I don't know, year or two? Just help us understand how that's looking in the business. Thanks.Geoff Martha: Well, let me just start off by saying, I appreciate your question on supply chain. It's been a big focus area for us. And I know a couple of thousand people at Medtronic that do think it's a pretty sexy place to be and are pretty proud of the work that we're doing. To answer the question, I'll turn it over to Karen on the cost question.Karen Parkhill: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Yes, when we're working on improving processes and driving better cost down, it does take investment. That investment is included in the guidance that we've given and is -- it's part of the reason that our gross margins are not yet stable. But we fully expect those investments to pay off over time and to help drive costs down more than inflation as we work to bring our gross margins up. Hopefully, that's helpful.Patrick Wood: Amazing. Thank you.Ryan Weispfenning: Okay. Thanks, Patrick. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks.Geoff Martha: Well, first of all, thanks, everyone, for the questions. And as always, we appreciate your support and your continued interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our Q2 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, November 21. With that, thanks again for joining us today, and have a great rest of your day.]"

In the BRCAm subgroup (n=85), the median rPFS and median OS were not reached (NR) for patients receiving LYNPARZA plus abi/pred (95% CI, NR-NR for both rPFS and OS) compared to a median of 8.4 months (95% CI, 5.5-14.8) and 23.6 months (95% CI, 17.8-NR), respectively, for those receiving placebo plus abi/pred. As previously reported, there was a statistically significant improvement in rPFS in the full intention-to-treat (ITT) population in the PROpel trial (n=796).The safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA plus abi/pred in PROpel was in line with that observed in prior clinical trials and the known profiles of the individual medicines. In the ITT population, common adverse events (AEs) in patients who received LYNPARZA plus abi/pred were anemia (45.5%), nausea (28.1%) and fatigue (27.9%).Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in Japan and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the region, with an estimated 96,400 new cases and 13,300 deaths in 2022. Despite various treatment options available, the prognosis for mCRPC remains poor, with limited treatment options for patients whose cancer progresses following initial treatment.Story continuesMototsugu Oya, professor and chairman, department of urology, Keio University School of Medicine, Japan, said, ""The PROpel trial showed that the combination of LYNPARZA plus abiraterone delivered clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes for patients with BRCAm mCRPC. With this approval, patients in Japan will now have the opportunity to benefit from this new treatment combination which has the potential to become the new standard of care for patients with BRCA mutations.""Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, oncology business unit, AstraZeneca, said, ""This LYNPARZA combination has been shown to reduce the risk of disease progression or death compared to standard of care and underscores the critical importance of BRCA testing at metastatic diagnosis. Today’s approval is a major step forward for patients in Japan with BRCAm mCRPC who urgently need new first-line treatment options.""Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories, said, ""Prostate cancer impacts thousands of patients in Japan each year, and currently there are limited options available to those with metastatic disease. It is very important to develop and deliver novel treatment combinations to patients with BRCAm mCRPC that improve on the current standard of care.""LYNPARZA plus abi/pred is approved in several other countries for the treatment of appropriate adult patients with mCRPC based on the PROpel trial. In the European Union (EU), LYNPARZA plus abi/pred is approved for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated, regardless of biomarker status. This combination is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCAm mCRPC. For the U.S. indication, patients should be selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.In Japan, LYNPARZA was previously approved for patients with BRCAm mCRPC who have progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent (NHA) based on results from the Phase 3 PROfound trial. It is approved in the EU and China for the same indication, as well as in the U.S. for patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated mCRPC (BRCA and other HRR gene mutations) who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone. For the U.S. indication, patients are selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.About PROpelPROpel (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03732820) is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial testing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA versus placebo when given in addition to abi/pred in 796 patients with mCRPC who had not received prior chemotherapy or NHAs in the mCRPC setting. The major efficacy outcome was rPFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group (bone) criteria. Overall survival was an additional efficacy outcome measure.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. In the combined data of two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies (PROfound and PROpel) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (N=1180), VTE occurred in 8% of patients who received LYNPARZA, including pulmonary embolism in 6%. In the control arms, VTE occurred in 2.5%, including pulmonary embolism in 1.5%. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment.FemalesAdvise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose.MalesAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance BRCAm Advanced Ovarian CancerMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: nausea (77%), fatigue (67%), abdominal pain (45%), vomiting (40%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (37%), constipation (28%), upper respiratory tract infection/influenza/nasopharyngitis/bronchitis (28%), dysgeusia (26%), decreased appetite (20%), dizziness (20%), neutropenia (17%), dyspepsia (17%), dyspnea (15%), leukopenia (13%), urinary tract infection (13%), thrombocytopenia (11%), and stomatitis (11%).Most common laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1-4) in ≥25% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: decrease in hemoglobin (87%), increase in mean corpuscular volume (87%), decrease in leukocytes (70%), decrease in lymphocytes (67%), decrease in absolute neutrophil count (51%), decrease in platelets (35%), and increase in serum creatinine (34%).ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with BevacizumabMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients treated with LYNPARZA/bevacizumab and at a ≥5% frequency compared to placebo/bevacizumab in the first-line maintenance setting for PAOLA-1 were: nausea (53%), fatigue (including asthenia) (53%), anemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%), and leukopenia (18%).

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.Please see complete Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About LYNPARZA® (olaparib)LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as BRCA mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.About metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in male patients globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate. Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body, despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer are estimated to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within five years, with at least 84% of these patients presenting with metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Of patients with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.About BRCA mutationsBRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2) are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated or altered such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer. Approximately 10% of patients with mCRPC will have BRCA mutations, which are associated with a poor prognosis and worse outcomes.About the AstraZeneca and Merck strategic oncology collaborationIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize certain oncology products including LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop these products in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop these oncology products in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide.

The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at a decent 1.22. But, is the stock fairly valued? This comprehensive analysis explores Merck's valuation and financial strength to answer that question. Read on to understand the intrinsic value of Merck (NYSE:MRK).Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with ROST. Click here to check it out. MRK 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MRKMerck &amp; Co Inc (NYSE:MRK), a leading pharmaceutical company, develops products to treat various conditions across therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic disease, cancer, and infections. The company's immuno-oncology platform contributes significantly to its overall sales. Merck also has a robust vaccine business, with treatments for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases, HPV, and shingles. The company sells animal health-related drugs as well. Geographically, the United States generates just under half of Merck's sales.At present, Merck's stock price sits at $111.72, slightly above its GF Value of $105.46. This comparison between the stock price and the GF Value offers an initial insight into the company's fair value.Merck (MRK): A Fairly Valued Player in the Pharmaceutical IndustryUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It's calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it indicates overvaluation and potentially poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and likely to deliver higher future returns.Considering these factors, Merck appears to be fairly valued. Its long-term stock return is expected to align closely with its business growth rate.Merck (MRK): A Fairly Valued Player in the Pharmaceutical IndustryLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could lead to permanent capital loss. Thus, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing its shares. Merck's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.17, ranking worse than 77.26% of 1007 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. GuruFocus ranks Merck's financial strength as 5 out of 10, indicating a fair balance sheet.Story continuesMerck (MRK): A Fairly Valued Player in the Pharmaceutical IndustryProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially those demonstrating consistent profitability over the long term. Merck has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years, with revenues of $58.30 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.22 in the past 12 months. Its operating margin of 10.95% is better than 63.48% of 1035 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. GuruFocus ranks Merck's profitability as strong.Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. Merck's growth ranks better than 77.41% of 912 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry, with a 3-year average annual revenue growth of 15.4% and a 3-year average EBITDA growth rate of 23.9%.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another way to assess its profitability. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Merck's ROIC is 4.81, and its WACC is 6.34.Merck (MRK): A Fairly Valued Player in the Pharmaceutical IndustryConclusionIn summary, Merck (NYSE:MRK) appears to be fairly valued.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can go to 5 Most Innovative Companies of All Time.Humans have been innovating since they first stepped foot on Earth. For any civilization, innovation was a milestone that changed the way of living. Today’s competitive market environment heavily depends on innovation. Entrepreneurs are constantly looking for unconventional ways to design new products and services to overcome old solutions. With the saturation of global markets, innovation has become critical across all industries. Innovation is a time taking process that requires a thorough understanding of the business idea and proper implementation.As we mentioned earlier, innovation has become a buzzword since the launch of Apple’s first iPhone and it still circulates in the market, the media, and schools. Companies are focused on innovation more than ever before and it has become a prime target for executives. Startup is a new fancy name in the business world and the hype around this word is surreal. You can't understand the dynamics of a startup unless you work on a business idea. There are chances of failure and businesses that entered the market have experienced both success and failure. For instance, Quibi is one of the biggest startup failures in recent times. The short-form American streaming platform generated $1.75 billion from venture capitalists and media houses in two funding rounds. It was a few weeks before the target launch of Quibi when the world went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 6, 2020, Quibi launched its streaming platform in the U.S. and Canada. The company went on to release its streaming platform undermining the sudden shift in the market following the pandemic. A few months later on October 22, Quibi decided to quit its operations. Quibi’s founders pointed out the pandemic to be the root cause of its failure. However, it was the wrong decision-making of the founders which led to a collapse of such a massive investment. Therefore, running a startup and bringing innovation to the market isn't that simple. It requires building up a corporate setup that demands patience, right timing, and a lot of resources. Elon Musk in a podcast with Lex Fridman said, “What matters is the pace of innovation, access to resources, and raw materials.” Story continuesWhy Innovation?For a company, innovation is a tool through which it survives the competition. Creativity is the key aspect of innovation and in business, creativity cultivates unique ideas. Creative ideas play a viable role in producing solutions to problems. However, creative ideas don’t guarantee innovation, but for an idea to be innovative, it must be useful for the consumer. James Chin Moody who holds a Ph.D. in innovation theory believes that innovation is not a noun but rather a process of technological change. Moody who is the CEO of Australian package delivery company, Sendle, while talking to CNBC Make It said:“Innovation is the process of creating the thing, yes, but that’s such a small fraction. It’s the process of taking the thing and convincing someone that they need the thing. The process in the middle is really what we mean when we talk about innovation.”In the modern world, every company has adopted innovation in the form of technology. In the context of business, innovation conceives, develops, delivers, and scales new products and services. In an episode of the Inside the Strategy Room podcast, McKinsey’s senior partner Laura Furstenthal defined innovation in a corporate setup:“If you look up 'innovation' in a dictionary, you see definitions like creating novel ideas or even just the word 'creativity.' We believe you have to think about the impact, so our definition of innovation incorporates delivering net new growth that is sustainable, repeatable, and substantial. You can focus on new products, markets, customers, or business models, but however you measure it, innovation has to increase value and drive growth.”As we mentioned earlier, value innovation is really important for a company’s survival. Value innovation comprises the introduction of new products and minimization of costs at the same time. Every company once started with a small setup and grew bigger with time. In McKinsey’s research on the existence of innovation “essentials,” the study focused on how competent 183 companies were at innovation. The research compared those companies with a proprietary database of economic profit, which was net profit subtracted from the cost of capital. The study revealed that companies that adopted innovation had a significant advantage over their peers. The companies with the most innovation essentials generated higher economic profit, up to 2.4 times higher than other players.Contemporary InnovationAutomotive, technology, biotechnology, and healthcare and pharmaceutical industries comprise some of the most innovative companies worldwide. Technology is a diversified segment including computer and information technology. Computer technology has evolved over the past few years and semiconductors chips are the key to the innovation of this segment, thanks to advancements in semiconductor technology. In today's world, almost everything we own and operate on a daily basis has semiconductors in it. Semiconductors have really lifted the game of processors in the computing world.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) are two of the leading semiconductor chip makers in the market. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been doing a remarkable job as the company continues to move uphill. The semiconductor company is set to announce its second quarter results on August 23. Analysts are really interested in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and have raised their targets ahead of earnings. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri lifted NVIDIA’s stock price target to $540 from $475. Similarly, Wells Fargo has also upgraded its price target to $500 from $450. Analysts are bullish on the stock and Morgan Stanley has named NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as its “top pick.” ""We think it's hard to bet against NVDA's preeminent positioning as the primary beneficiary of an AI-driven architectural data center transformation,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers in his research note. The semiconductor giant has been under the radar this year, driven by optimism around its potential for AI and demand for its components. Global firms and governments are seeking NVIDIA chips for the all-important build-up of AI software. E-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been using NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs to power Amazon Web Services. AWS and NVIDIA have been in partnership for more than 10 years and have developed solutions for virtual workstations, machine learning, high-performance computing, and IoT services. On March 21, AWS and NVIDIA joined hands to build the world's most scalable, on-demand AI system that will solve complex large language models and create generative AI applications. On May 23, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) collaborated to accelerate their AI initiatives. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will integrate NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software into its Azure Machine Learning. This will allow Azure customers to speed up their production, deployment, and management of customized applications through 100 NVIDIA AI frameworks and NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Whereas Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is keeping up with the chipmaker and is aiming to create a bigger ecosystem that is more power-efficient than Nvidia’s chip. Google has built its custom chip called the Tensor Processing Unit. The chip is handling 90% of the company's work on AI training. On April 4, Cornell University published a paper in which Google claimed to have a 1.7 times faster and 1.9 times more power-efficient system compared to Nvidia's A100 chip. These tech giants are really shaping the future and innovating technology through AI and semiconductors. The demand for semiconductors is continuing to rise and electric cars are one of the biggest semiconductor marketplaces. Electric cars are highly dependent on semiconductor chips. The innovation in semiconductor technology potentially offers longer battery life for EVs. Moreover, the chips make the EV system smarter and safer to provide risk-free rides. EVs are using AI and semiconductors simultaneously to improve the ecosystem of electric cars for their passengers. Moreover, semiconductors are also being used at the backend of systems to support the software of EVs. Elon Musk has hinted that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is highly dependent on NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. Here are some of the comments from Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Q2 2023 earnings call:“You see a lot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. I would say if they’re so great, why can’t they make a self-driving car? Because it’s harder. That’s why. So -- but I do think -- I think there’s some great AI companies out there. But just fundamentally, the staggering amount of data we’ve got to process, it’s got to be processed somehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that.So that’s what Dojo is designed to do is optimize for video training. It’s not optimized for LLMs. It’s optimized for video training. With video training, you have a much higher ratio of compute-to-memory bandwidth, so -- whereas LLMs tends to be memory bandwidth choked. So that’s it. I mean -- but like I said, we’re also -- we have some -- we’re using a lot of NVIDIA hardware. We’ll continue to -- we’ll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast as NVIDIA will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They’ve done an incredible job.And frankly, I don’t know if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can’t. So they’ve got so many customers. They’ve been kind enough to, nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders. But yes, the sheer magnitude of video training -- because like I said, we’re not trying to just get as good as human. We want to get to 10 times better than human, maybe 100 times better than human.”Whereas NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) counterpart Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is planning to reveal a new series of Radeon graphics cards. The senior vice president of AMD, Scott Herkelman in a tweet mentioned that the chip maker is set to make major announcements at Gamescom. Herkelman didn’t point out any specifics about the announcements. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su during the Q1 2023 earnings call said that they were on track to launch the GPU ramp of MI300 in Q4 2023.""And then I would say, from an overall market standpoint, I think enterprise will still be mixed with the notion that we expect some improvement. It depends a little bit on the macro situation. And then as we go into the second half of the year, in addition to Genoa, we’re also ramping Bergamo. So that’s on track to launch here in the second quarter and will ramp in the second half of the year. And then as we get towards the end of the year, we also have our GPU ramp of MI300. So with that, we start the ramp in the fourth quarter of our supercomputing wins as well as our early cloud AI wins. So those are all the factors. Of course, we’ll have to see how the the year play about how we’re positioned from an overall product and road map standpoint for Data Center.""While innovation is usually linked to technological advancements, there are companies outside of the tech sector that are and have been innovating in their respective domains for decades now. Let's take a look at some of the most innovative companies of all time.25 Most Innovative Companies of All TimeSergey Nivens/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe took the 25 companies from the most innovative companies list published by Forbes, BCG, PwC, and CEOWorld Magazine. We ranked the companies based on their appearance in a number of sources and average scores. So, the company that appeared in all four sources and had the least average score on the list was ranked higher, and so on. The average score was calculated by simply summing up the ranks of each company in each source and then dividing it by the number of sources. This had the effect of assigning a greater average score to companies that were ranked lower in our sources and similarly assigning a lower average score to companies that were ranked at the top.

The latest quality issue is due to improperly shaped holes in the aft pressure bulkhead of some planes.The bulkhead is a structure that seals off the rear of the pressurized cabin. The parts in question were made by Spirit, whose shares hit an over two-and-a-half year low of $20.09.But not all 737 fuselages will be impacted as Spirit uses multiple suppliers for the aft pressure bulkhead.Boeing believes the defect is limited to a portion of its bestselling MAX 8 model, but was evaluating if older-model 737 Next Generation jets have also been impacted.""It is early days on both the near and long-term financial impacts of the issue, but it appears the fix is likely to take several weeks for completed aircraft,"" Citi analyst Jason Gursky said in a note.The planemaker's ratio of enterprise value to sales for the next 12 months is 2, compared to 1.3 for rival Airbus, as per Refinitiv data. A low ratio implies a more attractive investment opportunity.The defect also adds more pressure on Spirit after it took a financial hit from a another quality issue and reported bleak results due to a worker strike earlier this year.Boeing's shares were trading at $219.50 compared with Wall Street's median price target of $254.70.

202,d84cd0cb-46a1-3408-bf4d-94da14c57fd2,SO,2023-08-24,Southern (NYSE:SO) shareholders have earned a 13% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-nyse-shareholders-earned-13-110033904.html,1692874833,STORY,['SO'],"[The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) share price is 52% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 14% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Southern There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Southern achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 4.0% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 9% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Southern, it has a TSR of 87% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveSouthern shareholders are down 11% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 6.8%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 13% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Southern   (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.Of course Southern may not be the best stock to buy.

Following our prepared remarks, Mary, Frank and Mike will respond to your questions. With that, I'll now turn it over to Mary.Mary N. DillonThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We have a number of topics we'd like to discuss this morning, including our second quarter results, updated outlook for the year, capital allocation, additions to our team, changes in our organizational structure and the ongoing execution of our Lace Up plan. I'd like to start by touching briefly on our Lace Up plan to reinforce that we continue to believe the actions we're taking will drive our businesses forward, set Foot Locker up for sustainable and profitable growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.I'm confident that we're executing the right strategies, simplifying and focusing our business and investing in capabilities required to be the modern omnichannel retailers synonymous with sneakers and sneaker culture. And we have strong assets and leverage. We have an authentic 50-year heritage that's rooted in basketball and sneaker culture with an iconic brand with over 90% brand awareness and strong social media engagement.And we have strong brand partner relationships as a top wholesale partner for leading brands in our industry. With that said, we are continuing to operate in a highly dynamic retail environment. And while we developed the Lace Up plan with the knowledge that 2023 would be a reset year, sales have been softer than expected through the first half.This has led us to further update our guidance for the year. In addition, as you saw in our press release this morning, our Board has made the decision to pause our dividend to provide us with additional flexibility as we execute our strategies and invest in the business to return to growth. Looking back to March, when we outlined our Lace Up plan and our longer-term targets, we were coming off a strong holiday and had not yet seen the full weight of the macro environment on our lower income consumer.This became much more evident through the second quarter, including a weaker start to back-to-school. The store traffic and conversion challenges we began to see in late Q1 persisted through the second quarter as our customers remained cautious with their discretionary dollars. As a result, we promoted more heavily than initially planned to better compete for a share of our customers' wallet and manage our inventory levels.These trends are reflected in our second quarter financial results with comps down 9.4% at the lower end of our down high single-digit guidance, which we offset with disciplined expense management, helping us to deliver a non-GAAP EPS of $0.04, near the high end of our guidance range of $0 to $0.05. The same sales and promotional dynamics have continued into August and as a result, we've lowered our sales and margin outlook for the year.We've continued to reduce our inventory position as a result of our promotional strategies and our updated outlook for the year assumes we continue that progress to end the year flat to slightly down year-over-year. This sets us up to be better positioned into the holiday season and to transition this well into 2024.In addition, we remain committed to expense discipline and continue to make progress on our cost savings plan this year. Our team remains agile, and we believe that the steps we're taking will allow us to continue to navigate the challenging macro environment and invest behind our strategic initiatives in support of longer-term shareholder value creation.A critical part of our path forward is having a leadership team in place that brings a right combination of industry and Foot Locker knowledge with best-in-class retail experience to bring our strategies to life. I'm excited to now have my new senior leadership team fully in place after a series of recent hires, and they bring the right combination of functional expertise, enterprise thinking and collaboration, requirements in the fast-changing world of retail and elevated customer expectations.As you know, since the beginning of the year, we brought on a number of talented individuals in critical positions, including a Chief Technology Officer and Chief Customer Officer (technical difficulty). And just this quarter, we welcomed Kristin Bauer, who was most recently at TCGplayer.com and who has also spent time at T.J. Maxx, Ulta Beauty and Target as our new Chief Supply Chain Officer.And Jennifer Kraft, who was most recently at Starbucks, also joined us as our new EVP and General Counsel. We also welcomed our new EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Baughn, who brings with him over 15 years of retail finance experience, most recently serving as Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer at Kohl's.Mike's been an excellent addition to the team and will be a great partner in helping us achieve our Lace Up plan ambitions. With our senior leadership team in place, we've also recently made important structural changes to our merchandising, marketing and finance teams designed to enhance our ability to execute and immediately improve our forecasting skills and inventory management capabilities.Frank and Mike will share more on these changes in a few moments. I'd like to now provide more details on the progress we're making within our Lace Up plan, even as we're facing a tougher year than expected. As you know, there are 4 strategic pillars to our Lace Up plan, expand sneaker culture, power up the portfolio, deepen our relationships with customers and best-in-class omni.We're sharpening our competitive toolkit by investing behind certain technologies and capabilities to better position the business for offense and to better meet our customers' ever-evolving expectations. We're also helping our vendor partners drive incremental growth for their franchises. We're focused on being a strong partner to the brands we work with, collaborating deeply across merchandising, marketing and our omni-experience.We're partnering much further upstream to build out multiyear growth plans and co-creating customer-facing marketing ideas that will drive our joint businesses. We've also been enhancing our capabilities around customer insights and data, allowing us to now share specific consumer segment opportunities and demand creation ideas with our partners.As I noted earlier, we paused our dividend to provide us with greater flexibility in the current environment. We know that leaning into Lace Up is the right decision to level up our capabilities and best position the business to compete in the modern marketplace. Looking forward, we'll prioritize initiatives that will drive the greatest immediate return and also make investments in foundational areas critical to our longer-term goals as a consumer-driven omnichannel retailer.While we're in the early days of Lace Up, our team is energized by the green shoots we're seeing as our strategy starts to take hold. These proof points make us even more confident that we're moving forward in the right direction. Let me walk you through our progress on each of our 4 strategic pillars. Our first imperative is to expand sneaker culture by serving more sneaker occasions, providing more choice and driving greater distinction.While our reset with Nike continues to impact the business overall, we're seeing stronger results in our Nike and Jordan Basketball business. This includes Air Force 1, AJ1, Dunk and Jordan Retro. We're also encouraged by the early sales of the new Nike Tech Fleece program, and we're thrilled to help launch Nike's first female signature basketball sneaker in the quarter.Meanwhile, we're continuing to develop very collaborative plans with our Nike partners, investing in key areas, including basketball, kids and sneaker culture. In fact, we just partnered in bringing the best of Nike and Jordan to the basketball community in New York City with our exclusive New York versus New York Grassroots retail activation.Beyond our partnership with Nike, we're making progress on diversifying our assortments to provide more choices to our customers in line with their evolving needs, including more sneaker occasion. As a key example, we're leaning into our partnership with New Balance, now our fourth largest brand and which grew well over 100% in the second quarter.We also remain excited about the trajectories of newer brands like On and HOKA in performance running. While we're helping these brands extend their reach to our core shoppers, they're also helping us expand our customer base, including a more affluent and female customer. And we continue to push ahead with our growth plans with these brands. On is now in 280 doors and on its way to 350 this year. And HOKA is currently in 100 doors and headed towards 150 by year end.We also continue to see outperformance from brands like Puma, Crocs, ASICS and Brooks as our customers are seeking out other brands with us. As a result, in line with our strategy, the diversity of our brand mix beyond our top brand Nike increased to 36% from 31% last year, making good progress towards our goal of over 40% by 2026.Our second imperative power of the portfolio is about simplifying our portfolio of banners, creating clear lanes for each of them, while also transforming our real estate footprint through new formats and shifting off mall. Within simplifying and creating distinct lanes, first, we completed the wind down of our Sidestep banner, which will help us sharpen our focus on the Foot Locker brand in EMEA.And our transition of Champs Sports continues to make progress. While the Champs Sports banner continues to be the most acutely impacted by changes in our Nike allocation, the team is getting sharper with the brand's positioning as it appeals to that active athletes.On real estate transformation, we opened or converted 4 new Foot Locker community and power stores across the globe in the second quarter, giving us approximately 185 stores in these newer formats, which allows us to offer a fuller expression of the category.We remain encouraged by trends that we're seeing in these locations year-to-date with traffic levels, conversion rates and average tickets all outpacing our core fleet. These stores also help us reach consumers across channels with our digital trends outperforming the rest of the market when we open up one of these new store formats.All in, our new store formats now represent about 12% of our global square footage, up from 9% last year and making good progress towards our 2026 target of 20%. We're also continuing to expand the footprint at WSS, our off-mall banner that is the leading retailer focused on athletic footwear for the Latino families.In the quarter, we opened 6 new locations, including 3 in the Miami metro area. Those stores are off to an encouraging start, and we remain optimistic about our regional door expansion opportunities for WSS on its path to becoming a $1.3 billion business over time, up from $600 million in 2022. Together with the off-mall locations in Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker, we're making strides with our overall shift to more off-mall exposure with penetration reaching 36% of North American square footage, up 4 points from a year ago, and tracking well against our goal of 50% by 2026.Lastly, as part of our real estate transformation, we closed 108 underperforming stores during the quarter.Our third imperative is deepen our relationship with our customers, which is focused on building brand equity, reaching a broader set of customers and enhancing our loyalty program and overall CRM capabilities.On building brand equity, we're sharpening our creative point of view to better articulate our brand proposition and elevate our mind share with consumers. For the first time, we launched a truly global back-to-school campaign, resulting in significantly increased engagement versus last year. These efforts are translating into online customer acquisition that grew by double digits in the second quarter in North America.We've invested incremental media dollars based on strong short-term online returns, fueling customer acquisitions as well as short-term online business growth. We're excited to unveil a full relaunch of the Foot Locker brand platform, including a high reach 360-degree campaign this holiday. On loyalty, 22% of our sales in the quarter were through our current loyalty program compared to 24% last year.This was driven by lower Nike launch product allocation, which drives high participation among current loyalty members. We continue to make steady progress with sign-ups globally and are looking forward to our new FLX program pilot launch in Canada next month.And our final imperative is to be best-in-class omni, which means improving our digital presence as well as better integrating our channels with each other.Our digital penetration in the quarter increased to 15.5%, up 50 basis points year-over-year when excluding East Bay, which we closed late last year. Digital comps in our Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker banners in North America were actually up during the quarter with strength driven by increases in multiple conversions and new customer growth year-over-year.Our focus on site experience enhancements has generated significant wins, adding up to over $50 million in incremental annualized sales with new experiences and features. Our digital NPS and fulfillment NPS have improved significantly as well as we address customer friction points in our core online shopping flow as well as improve the speed and reliability of our shipments.Into the back half, we'll continue to upgrade our site experience with improvements in search relevancy, site navigation, product recommendations and display. This work in combination with our marketing efforts gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 25% e-commerce penetration over time. In switching to stores, this quarter, we also continued our rollout of upgraded handheld technologies, adding over 1,100 locations in the quarter.This technology gives our stripers improved visibility on inventory, access to product information, ability to check out customers and improving in-store conversion. We now have updated handhelds in over 80% of our stores, up from over 50% last quarter and still expect to be fully rolled out to 100% of the fleet by the end of this year.In closing, I want to emphasize that while this reset year has been tougher than we expected, I am excited about the traction we're seeing with our Lace Up plan. Importantly, our executive team is energized by the transformation taking place in the business and aligned with the Lace Up strategies. While we're early in our multiyear journey, we're confident we'll evolve Foot Locker to be a competitive omnichannel retailer and drive sustainable and profitable long-term growth and shareholder value creation. And now I'd like to hand it over to Frank to provide more detail on our performance by banner.Franklin R. BrackenThank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Before I dig into our 2Q performance, I wanted to address Mary's earlier comments on changes to our commercial organization. To accelerate our digital e-commerce and loyalty strategies, we just announced several key hires on our new Chief Customer Officer, Kim Waldmann. Andrew Rauch joined us as Vice President, Global Ecommerce, where he will lead our digital merchandising strategies and operations across all banners and regions.Andrew joins us from PVH and Urban Outfitters, where he held similar roles. Avery Worthing-Jones also joined Foot Locker as Vice President, Digital Product Management, where he will oversee our digital customer experience across mobile, app and loyalty as well as other key technology investment areas like merchandising systems. Also, Slavka Jancikova started as our new Vice President of Marketing for Europe. Slack's experience at Nike and Adidas will be invaluable in building strong brand partnerships and consumer connections.To help elevate our brand storytelling and content across all channels, Matthew Wright joins us as our new Vice President and Global Creative Director. Matthew will leverage his deep experience with brands like Nike, Levi's and Urban Outfitters to ensure our Foot Locker brands maintain their high levels of consumer engagement and relevance in sneaker culture.And finally, we are bringing on a new Vice President of Loyalty and CRM who will drive a holistic agenda, including the relaunch of our FLX rewards program and our personalization road map. These changes under Kim give us the leadership front line to modernize our demand creation capabilities and to position our brands to connect with consumers in a truly meaningful way.Next to that, we have made changes to our merchandising organization to streamline decision making and align accountabilities more directly within our consumer-led banners. First, we realigned the buying teams within our banner GM structure, enabling a higher degree of coordination and accountability across the merchandising function.As we have created very clear lanes of differentiation between the banners, now is the right time for this change. Additionally, this puts our buying function closer to the consumer and our marketing teams so that we can partner with vendors in a more integrated manner, leading with consumer insights and developing holistic omnichannel experiences.We also appointed Bryon Milburn to a newly defined role as our Senior Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. Bryon brings over 30 years of industry experience as a merchant and general manager. And in his new capacity, he will build a merchandising center of excellence to elevate our visual merchandising and in-store experience, modernize our merchandising planning, analytics and data sharing and finally, collaborate closely with Kim's customer marketing organization to elevate our brand partnerships.He will also oversee our global footwear strategy team and our vertical brand development function. Bryon will be announcing some key new hires in the coming weeks to our global merchandising organization. In summary, these changes to our organization will enable us to modernize our capabilities in support of Lace Up, while bringing a more integrated and consumer-led offense to our vendor partnerships.Now let me comment on our second quarter performance. By category, footwear comp down high single digits, while apparel fell mid-teens and accessories were down low double digits. In footwear, recall that we are cycling through the second of 4 quarters of the Nike reset. As I've previously shared, we made the decision to prefer Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker for that allocated product over Champ Sports.Starting with basketball, we are seeing relative strength in court classics and retro styles from Nike and Jordan, which continue to be a meaningful connection point to the culture of basketball for our men's, women's and kids consumers. And we were pleased to help launch the Nike Sabrina 1, Nike's first signature basketball shoe for a female athlete.As we think about expanding sneaker culture, we welcome the opportunity to broaden access to new consumers with great product innovation and storytelling like the Sabrina 1. I would also like to highlight our recent basketball partnership with the Nike brand this summer to celebrate the heart and soul of basketball here in New York City. We were proud partners of the New York versus New York City basketball program and were able to activate at retail, in local communities as well as digitally.And we are thrilled to be Nike's retail partner next month as we help them celebrate basketball culture across New York in the way that only Nike can. The running category continues to be a tale of 2 cities. New Balance continues to drive impressive growth in consumer connectivity across all banners and geographies. We were pleased to gain market share with the New Balance brand in Q2 and point to great innovation, storytelling and in-store presentation as the key levers, including events like Gray Day as well as featuring New Balance in our back-to-school campaign, sneaker season.We are also thrilled with the performance of On Running and HOKA, 2 brands that continue to bring category-defining innovation and style to the marketplace. As we grew market share with both of these brands in Q2, we are excited that they are bringing even more female consumers into sneaker culture and our retail banners. And so we're quite pleased to expand the door base in late Q2 to capture even more opportunity at back-to-school and holiday.Meanwhile, challenges remain within some core lifestyle running platforms. Our team is managing our inventory levels and merchandise margins while we navigate through these challenges and move our open-to-buy dollars to more productive categories. One trend-driven footwear concept that we are excited about this fall in holiday is terrace or the local football.Led by the Adidas brand, we are seeing strong global sell-throughs of key silhouettes, and our inventory and in-store presentation will continue to improve as the year goes on.Moving to apparel. While the category was down significantly, our vertical brands outperformed down 1% and reaching 12% penetration or 2 points better than last year.We remain excited about our newer labels, Locker and Cozi as well as the launch of CSG active this fall season. We're also seeing very strong sell-throughs of the new Nike Tech Fleece collection at back-to-school, which we expect to continue into the back half. And while we've moderated our expectations for the back half, there are a number of exciting trends and innovations to point to this fall and holiday season, including the scaling of Nike signature basketball models at holiday during the NBA season tip-off and key icons like the Dunk.Rihanna's collaboration with Puma is launching again this holiday. The exclusive launch of Anthony Edwards signature basketball shoe with Adidas, increased supply of models like the Adidas Samba, Gazelle and CANVAS which are gaining consumer momentum, seasonally relevant classics and concepts from UGG and the ongoing door expansion of On and HOKA.Additionally, we are incredibly excited to introduce our new Foot Locker brand platform this holiday season. Under the positioning, the Heart of Sneakers, Foot Locker will be helping sneaker enthusiasts and gift givers across the globe with a big assist from our world famous stripers. In collaboration with our vendor partners and featuring the best of sneaker culture and a few cameos that are sure to get the consumers' attention, we will make sure that no shopper is left behind with the help of our Striper entourage.By channel, comparable sales in our stores decreased 8.6%, driven mainly by traffic declines, but also from in-store conversion and some pressure on average ticket. Digital comps fell by 13.1%. However, excluding East Bay, the e-com-only banner we wound down late last year, digital comps declined by 5.4%, much better than our original plan. Encouragingly, our Foot Locker North America and Kids Foot Locker banners saw positive digital comps as we are seeing momentum with new nonlaunch customers and higher conversion rates led by mobile.In North America, overall comps declined by 12.4%. At Foot Locker North America, comps fell by 4.6%, with the consumer and product headwinds cited above offsetting strength in the culture of basketball and running innovation. Encouragingly, our power and community stores out comped the balance of chain in Q2 by several percentage points.Kids Foot Locker comps were down 4.7%, driven by similar headwinds as Foot Locker. Our House of Play doors are comping several points better than the balance of chain, giving us confidence that these expanded formats are connecting well with consumers.With the door expansions of New Balance and HEYDUDE during Q2 and the successful launch of On Running at KFL for back-to-school, we remain convinced that KFL is a highly differentiated and competitive advantage for Foot Locker, Inc. At Champs Sports, comps were down 25%, as we prefer the Foot Locker banner for key launches and constrained supply of Nike Inc. products during the reset.That said, the Champs team has done a great job sharpening their consumer merchandising and marketing pillars of performance, sports style and sneaker essentials. As such, we did see good growth from performance brands such as Under Armour, ASICS, Brooks and Saucony. And while Champs continues to feel the greatest impact from the change with Nike, we're encouraged by the seeds being planted with the active athlete as our repositioning continues.Our WSS banner saw comps down 7.9% in 2Q, owing to a softer macro environment. While traffic was down, the business deployed tactical promotions to drive improved conversion as a partial offset. During the quarter, we opened 6 stores, bringing our total to 126 stores. And we are on track to open approximately 25 for the year for growth of 20%.Turning to Europe. Overall comps were down by 2.3%, with Foot Locker Europe down 1.1%, while Sidestep comped down 35% as we exited the business. As the macro environment remains challenging across parts of Europe, the team is focused on controlling the controllables with emphasis on conversion, inventory liquidation and reigniting the Foot Locker brand in key markets.In Asia Pacific, comps were up 0.4%. We saw Foot Locker banner comps up 5.7%, driven by successful brand diversification efforts and tourism returning to key big cities. Within Asia, we closed our stores in Macau and Hong Kong and completed our conversion to a licensing model in Singapore and Malaysia.We are thankful to have a strong local partner in MAP Active to execute our Foot Locker brand experience. And finally, at atmos, comps fell 10%, a strong tourism rebound in Japan was offset by a steep drag from launch. So while near-term trends are not meeting our expectations, the team remains committed to our Lace Up strategy.The new leadership talent that we have added as well as the marketing and merchandising capabilities we are building gives our team confidence that we are laying the foundation for long-term growth. I'll now hand the call over to Mike to go over the financials and guidance in more detail.Michael BaughnThank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I've been at Foot Locker for just over 2 months, and in that time, I've been diving in to learn the business and getting to know the team. And I am confident in the opportunities for growth we have ahead of us and that we are operating the right strategy to get there.That said, I'm realistic about the challenges facing us today as we operate through the reset portion of the Lace Up plan. I've had the opportunity to quickly partner with the leadership team, the finance department and the leaders of our banners. And I'd like to provide an update on where I've been focusing my attention.First is prioritization. With 2023 missing our original expectations, my work has been on how the business can best optimize its financial investments within markdowns, expenses and capital expenditure dollars, while knowing the business needs to continue to make the technology and capability investments to position us for the long term.Second and probably most important to the people listening on this call I've been looking at how the business is forecasted internally, what process improvements we can put in place and where accountability falls within the organization. That evaluation is why we made changes to how finance is structured across Foot Locker.Our banner Chief Financial Officers and their teams now report to me directly, whereas previously they reported up through their respective banners. I'm confident this increased connectivity across finance functions can instill more consistency into our internal forecasting capabilities and ensure we are optimizing our financial decisions for global Foot Locker.Third, in light of the tougher reset here in 2023, I've been focused on ensuring how our current performance will translate into holiday, then into 2024 and then into our longer-term financial goals. That means the progress that we have been making on inventory levels needs to continue into the back half, and we need to remain disciplined in our cost efforts to help fund our investments.Now turning to 2Q results. Starting with revenues. Our total sales fell by 9.9% on a comp decline of 9.4% at the lower end of our outlook of down high single digits. By month, May comps were down low double digits; June, down high single digits; and July, down in the low double-digit range again. While our launch calendar improved in July, our nonlaunch business decelerated as we approached back-to-school.And while we see our customers respond to newness, they remain value focused. And as a result, we continue to utilize increased promotions to support the business.Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter declined 460 basis points to 27.1%. Merchandise margins fell by 300 basis points, driven by higher promotions to move through inventory and to reach our price-sensitive shopper.We also continued to see elevated shrink levels. Occupancy deleveraged by 160 basis points on the sales decline. Offsetting pressure from promos, shrink and occupancy deleverage was approximately $15 million of gross margin savings from our cost optimization programs. For the second quarter, our SG&amp;A rate came in at 23.8%, representing deleverage of 190 basis points with savings from the cost optimization program of approximately $20 million, more than offset by deleverage on the sales decline, inflation and investments in frontline wage and technology.With our cost optimization program generating total savings of approximately $35 million in the second quarter, we remain on track to capture approximately 40% of the total $350 million targeted savings this year. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 59.5%, higher than our typical rate, but as expected, given the low level of overall earnings combined with losses in Asia that don't have a tax benefit.GAAP EPS came in at a loss of $0.05 and our non-GAAP earnings at $0.04, which is at the higher end of our $0 to $0.05 guidance.Moving on to our outlook for the rest of the year. Given our July exit rate and softness that is continuing into August, we are lowering our full year expectations. For the year, including the extra week, we are lowering our guidance for non-GAAP EPS to the range of $1.30 to $1.50, down from our prior range of $2 to $2.25.That is inclusive of the following drivers: we now expect comps to decline by 9% to 10% versus the prior range of down 7.5% to down 9%. The midpoint of that guidance range assumes no improvement in year-to-date comp performance. The lower end contemplates modest weakening in trends to reflect macro risk, including potential pressure from factors like the resumption of student loan payments.And the upper end reflects some of the early wins and building momentum we are seeing from our strategic initiatives. Overall, our store count will be down approximately 9% in 2023, with square footage down approximately 4% as we convert more stores to our larger formats. With the extra week adding approximately 1% to our sales, total sales for the 53-week year are expected to fall by 8% to 9%.With sales softer than anticipated, we are taking more aggressive actions on promotions to drive demand and manage our inventory to ensure we are best positioned for the upcoming holiday season and for a clean transition into 2024. As a result, we now expect our gross margin to decline by 390 to 410 basis points to a rate of 27.8% to 28.0% down from our previous guidance for a 310 to 330 basis points decline given steeper markdown activity to move through elevated inventory levels, occupancy deleverage on the bigger comp decline and elevated shrink.On SG&amp;A, we now expect to deleverage between 90 to 110 basis points to a rate of 22.7% to 22.9%. While we continue to manage our expenses tightly, we expect to see greater deleverage on the larger sales declines. Finally, our CapEx outlook for the year is now $290 million, updated from $305 million previously due to the favorable project pricing as well as a shift of project timing into early 2024.While we will not be providing quarterly guidance on an ongoing basis, we wanted to provide some context on our back half expectations. On earnings, our current view is that the third and fourth quarters land relatively similar on a non-GAAP per share basis, excluding the 53rd week. And finally, turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $180 million of cash and total liquidity of approximately $780 million, including our untapped credit facility.At quarter end, our inventories were 11% above last year, but down from the 25% at the start of the quarter. We still expect to end the year flat to slightly down versus last year. We paid $37 million in dividends and did not repurchase any stock during the quarter. And as Mary noted previously, given our 2023 performance and to position us with as much flexibility as possible, we are pausing our quarterly dividend.We will pay our dividend on October 27 to holders of record on October 13, as announced, after which we will pause.Before we turn it over to questions, I want to reiterate that our management team at Foot Locker is aligned and dedicated to implementing the Lace Up plan, and we're motivated by the early wins we are seeing.Acknowledging that 2023 is performing below our initial expectations, we intend to revisit our longer-term financial target timing as well as capital allocation plans beyond 2023 when we report our fourth quarter results. We look forward to updating you on our progress against our goals next quarter. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). Today's first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.Robert Scott DrbulI guess the question that I have is just around the Nike relationship. Can you just give us an update around when you think Nike comps could return to positive from the business standpoint? And then I guess just the other update would be helpful is like exclusive penetration, sort of what you're seeing on any level of exclusives within the business?Mary N. DillonThank you, Bob. This is Mary. And actually, let me just start by reiterating, we apologize for the quality of the audio of the call. Hopefully, the Q&amp;A will be clear. And if there's anything you need to clarify, please let us know. Bob, thank you for starting there. Let me just start by saying, obviously, Nike is a very important partner, and we continue to build a strong relationship with them.We really focus together on the areas that are unique and specific to both of us in the marketplace, basketball, kids and sneaker culture. And in fact, as you heard Frank mentioned in the prepared remarks, we just recently did a really neat grassroots event here in New York, celebrating the culture of basketball New York versus New York. And we're pleased to be one of the retailers launching the Sabrina 1 shoe for women. So that's all great.And we see lots of strength coming. This is yet the reset year though, of course, and so we knew that we'd be working through this for a couple of quarters as there's a reset in the marketplace and would expect that we will be back to growth as we move forward into the future year starting next year. So we're working closely together on those topics and feel really good about it. And do you want to talk about exclusives?Franklin R. BrackenSure. Absolutely. Yes. I would just say the team continues to make really good progress. So as examples, we've had great success with the Puma LaMelo that anniversaries into its third iteration, which will be launching here for the new NBA season. This holiday, we'll also be launching the Edwards 1 with our partners at Adidas.And then just recently on the topic of Nike, we celebrated a really great [junior] release in France at our stores in Marseille as well as across the better part of Continental Europe, which had incredible sell-throughs and generated a lot of tremendous buzz. So the team continues to make very good progress. And then next to that, you heard in my prepared remarks, our progress on vertical brands in Locker, Cozi and then the launch of CSG Active. So the team continues to make very good progress on exclusivity.Robert Scott DrbulGreat. And just a follow-up. On the decision to cut the dividend and the financial flexibility, just wondering if you could give us sort of your updated thoughts around the GOAT ownership stake that you have?Mary N. DillonMaybe we'll start with the dividend, if that's okay, and then we can come back to that. But as we -- as you know, part of our Lace Up plan is to pay the dividend about a 30%, 35% payout ratio. So with our new EPS guidance, we're at a substantial payout ratio. And along with the Board pause -- made the decision to pause to give us more flexibility and continue to invest in our long-term Lace Up plan. Would you like to add a thing about GOAT, Frank, on that?Franklin R. BrackenYes, sure. So what I can share is we continue to be a large shareholder within GOAT Group. We continue to partner each quarter on data sharing, looking for integration opportunities and insights into the marketplace. And certainly, we'll continue to update you guys as we see future results and future opportunities for the 2 brands.OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Warren Cheng with Evercore ISI.Warren ChengI wanted to ask about the Champs reposition. Are you making any tweaks to your strategy for Champs, especially outlined for us in March given what's been a pretty significant impact from the reposition? And also, is there a way to quantify the impact of the actions you've taken around speaker launches and pulling some Nike away from that banner?Franklin R. BrackenYes, I'll start. Thanks for the question on Champs. So as you recall, we talked about our sneaker growth map and then our new portfolio strategy. And Champs is very clearly positioned what we call the active athlete, which is over a $10 billion market opportunity here in North America alone. And then there's also very good adjacencies in what we call the quality seeker and the fashion forward expression.And so that's where we pivoted and repositioned the Champs brand, which is a meaningfully different place than it has been in the past and also very differentiated from Foot Locker. The team is making very good progress on what we call the 3 consumer pillars: that's performance; sport style, which has led to apparel; and then sneaker essentials.And in fact, we just got done resetting one of our core stores here and are very happy with how it's turning out. We've got another 20 that are planned for the quarter here. And we are starting to see some improved performance, and we're also getting very good vendor support, which is important as we think about '24.So we start to lap some of the difficult comps in terms of the Nike reset and some of the decisions we've taken, we expect that we'll see improved performance through the end of the year. And then obviously, we'll talk at a later date about our expectations for 2024.Warren ChengAnd just a follow-up on who that Champs customer will be once the banner is fully repositioned? Is the idea there to win new customers that weren't previously served by Foot Locker Inc. banner? Or is it more about segmenting serving your existing base?Franklin R. BrackenYes. I think it's a combination of both. I think we see an opportunity for new customer acquisition. When we talk about some of the performance brands, ASICs, Brooks, Under Armour, I think those are brands that have arguably been underrepresented in our Foot Locker banner. Think about our Foot Locker share in Nike at 16% ex that, we only have an 8% share of the rest of the market.And so Champs is a really great opportunity to extend that vendor assortment with a real keen focus on performance and sports style again, led through the lens of apparel. So I think it is truly incremental. So it'll be some migration to consumers, but also the acquisition of new consumers along the way.OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachThis is Brooke Roach filling in for Kate. How are you feeling about footwear channel inventory across the marketplace today? And as you think into the -- as you look into the back half of the year, what are you expecting for the competitive environment and for the magnitude of markdowns as you move through back-to-school and holiday?Mary N. DillonThank you for your question. I would say that what we're seeing is a couple of things. One is that our customer being somewhat under pressure in terms of household budget and being well discerning, price sensitive in an environment that is promotional. And we would expect that, that will continue as we go through the year.It's a somewhat higher inventory -- elevated inventory. We're all competing for that share of wallet. So we would expect that, that promotional level will continue through the rest of the year.OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonGreat. I wanted to clarify something on the Nike relationship that you said. So I think you said this was the second of 4 quarters in the Nike reset. But I think last quarter, if I recall correctly, you said that the vendor mix hadn't changed. So can you just clarify that for me? Maybe where did Nike penetration sit in the first quarter and second quarter versus last year? And then a follow-up on that is just how this impacts profitability or what the implications are there?Mary N. DillonYes. I'm not sure if can site the exact number. What I'll tell you is that we are certainly evolving. We're going through the reset year as we discussed. Our longer-term mix that we expect would be 48% of our business being other brands, and we ended this quarter at 36%, which is up from 31% a year ago. So that's plus 5 points. So we're making progress against that goal.Alexandra Ann StratonGot it. Okay. Maybe one follow-up just on the comp and how that kind of trended in the quarter. I think May was down low double digits, and it seems like the second quarter guide contemplated an acceleration. So can you just remind me why you thought that would happen, kind of what didn't come to fruition? And then maybe also what the June uptick was a result of?Michael BaughnYes. This is Mike. So I think as we saw through the quarter, again, to your point, operating with May from a low double-digit perspective and exited the quarter at a low double digit with a little bit of upside in June, I think we saw a lot of volatility from a promotional standpoint throughout the quarter. And we had expected for more progression in the month of July in our original guidance, really tied to momentum expected around back-to-school and the ramp-up of that holiday.I think what we've seen here is that it's been a promotional environment. And as we contemplated our guidance for the back half of the year, we're acknowledging that things have continued relatively similar into the month of August. In August, our comps are trending down high single digits to date.And that's really contemplated in the midpoint of the guidance that we provided. So again, our outlook is with our year-to-date trend. As we talk through the back half of the year, our downside scenario embeds further macro risk, really recognizing that our consumer is still under pressure. And that there are potential spending changes on the horizon with the resumption of student loans.Our upside scenario from a guidance standpoint reflects some of the early wins and building momentum we are seeing within our strategic initiatives.OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird.Jonathan Robert KompIf I could just follow up -- I wanted to follow up on the last comments there, Mike, just to work clear. Are you still trending down low double digits or high single digits? And does the guidance require any improvement from the July-August levels?Michael BaughnJonathan, so you were breaking up, but to make sure I heard you correctly, you were asking about the August trend. So our August comp trend is trending down high single digits, so a little bit better than where we exited the quarter within the month of July. And that high -- down high single digits is really in line with our year-to-date performance, which again is then the midpoint of our back half guidance.Jonathan Robert KompOkay. That's helpful. And hopefully, you can hear me okay. And then when we think about the comments around third and fourth quarter earnings being relatively similar, it doesn't look like traditionally, the normal pattern looks like fourth quarter typically is much higher in terms of the earnings of the profit dollars. Could you maybe just parse out a little further if there are some factors unique to the fourth quarter that we should expect?Michael BaughnYes. I think as we think through the Q3, Q4 split, again, we're highlighting a relatively even split in terms of EPS, absent of the 53rd week, which we've quantified as about $0.15. I think what we're acknowledging is our guidance range with the potential that 4Q could be a little tougher than 3Q, given the compares.But again -- and then with Q3 having some additional margin pressure year-over-year. So a little bit of those markdowns weighted more heavily towards Q3. But again, as of right now, they're relatively even split by (inaudible).OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with BofA.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonHow is your customer reacting to launches and limited product drops? Are those still driving outsized demand? Or is it really a focus on promotion that gets the core customer buying at this point?Franklin R. BrackenYes. We're still seeing very good sell-through on launch type products. Whether that's release date or pure launch, retro or innovation, I think the consumer is responding very favorably, and the sell-throughs continue to be very good. I'd just remind you that 2Q was our most challenging launch quarter in the fiscal year.So Q3, it'll moderate and be somewhere between Q1 and Q2. And in fourth quarter, it'll actually be the best relative comp comparison from a launch standpoint. So that 2 factors into our revised guidance. On the base business, sort of nonlaunch, we are seeing that promotional pressure is impacting sell-throughs, and it's been very competitive.We've seen heightened promotions from both brand ETC as well as retail competitors. And that went across the U.S. marketplace and also key markets into Europe, which again put pressure on comps and also sell-through and conversions throughout our store base.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Janine Stichter with BTIG.Janine Marie Hoffman StichterWelcome Mike. I wanted to ask about the inventory. I think you're still planning it down slightly, which would be higher than where sales are trending. Would your expectation be to be completely clean by year-end? And how should we think about based on where we are now the potential for promotions to linger into the first half of next year?And then I also wanted to ask about the expense base just based on your initial assessment, is there any room for additional cuts versus what was given at the Investor Day in March?Michael BaughnSo from an inventory standpoint, again, we're pleased with the progress that we made in the quarter here to be up 11%. We are calling out that we will end the year flat to slightly down. We have included within our guidance the necessary promotional levels that we believe will be needed to achieve that going into the back half of the year.I think from a cost perspective, acknowledging we're operating below our expectations in '23. As you can imagine, we've been very tight with our discretionary spending. I could really commend the team for being agile in that front. I do think we'll obviously -- we have a culture that is very disciplined on expense management, and we will continue to operate in that manner.And then from an overall cost perspective, again, we quantified $35 million of savings within the quarter across margin and SG&amp;A tied to our cost initiatives. So again, we're on track for the $350 million tied to the Lace Up plan as well.Franklin R. BrackenYes. And I'll just add, going back to our first quarter call, when we saw some of the slowdown in April begin in the base business, we immediately made some order book adjustments to our Q3 and our holiday order book. So that did not stay static. And as the businesses continue to sort of slow down and miss our internal expectations, we continue to work back with our vendor partners to make adjustments, both to the order book as well as our receipt flow for the back half of '23.OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.Joseph Isaac FeldmanI wanted to get a quick thought on why -- if you could share more color on back-to-school and what you're seeing there? It sounds like the August-to-date trend has improved a little from July. But we're hearing back-to-school is off to a decent start from a lot of other retailers out there. And so I was just wondering what you guys are seeing and what you're hearing from your customer with some more thought on that.Mary N. DillonYes. I would say that [year] booking at of trends in July and August, a little bit weaker than we would have hoped in terms of back-to-school. We promoted more heavily initially to compete for our share of the customers' wallet to manage inventory levels. I would say back-to-school is a tale of many different kinds of products and categories that consumers participate in.So we know sneakers are a part of that equation as are things like school supplies and sports equipment, right? So we feel like we're set up well in terms of having the products that our customers want for back-to-school, but it's a little bit softer for us. And we would add that pressure on our customer skews a little bit more towards pressure on discretionary spend, so people are being a little more price sensitive and a little more choiceful on their selection.OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantI'm kind of going to go back to the quarterly comments on the merchandise margin. I believe it was 300 basis points on higher promos and elevated shrink and then there was some offset to that. So within that 300 basis points, do you happen to take a write-down or a reserve on any aging product?Anything seasonal of that nature? And then with regard to shrink, just kind of tactically, how do you do that? Do you do it once a year in July? Or do you do it once a year in January? How should we think about the accrual of that going into the next couple of quarters?Michael BaughnSo thanks for the question. I think from a -- again, from a margin standpoint, the pressure within merch margin was the elevated promotion. We look at aged product on a regular basis, and that's always incorporated into our results. But the vast majority of what we did in the quarter and what we're doing in Q3 and then ultimately in Q4 is ensuring that we have a clean level of inventory to best operate through holiday and then best transition into 2024. So it's incorporated within our results.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantGreat. And then the shrink, if you will?Michael BaughnAnd from a shrink standpoint, it's from an order of magnitude in terms of our year-to-date performance within margin and then what's embedded within our guidance. The largest driver has been the promotions. The second biggest driver has been the deleverage we've seen within occupancy costs, which are embedded within our margin.And then the third shrink is a pressure incorporated into our back half guidance is expected similar shrink levels to what we've had year-to-date. So the increase in the guidance is really around the promotional activity.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantAnd then my very last one is freight recapture. Can you comment on that? And are you seeing that get better? If you go into the back half, is that plan to get better in the back half?Michael BaughnI apologize, you broke up. I heard recapture, could you...Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantFreight and/or supply chain, so mark on or the container like the shipping portion of freight, any benefit from kind of the recapture of that from last year?Michael BaughnI mean I think the easiest way to think about it is in the back half of our guidance, the biggest change, again, is to the promotional markdowns that we're incorporating to really build inventory where it needs to be.OperatorAnd our last question today comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.Paul Lawrence LejuezCan you give more detail on where within the assortment of that nonlaunch product? Did you need to be promotional more so than you'd expected? And can you talk about your ability to get vendor allowances from your key partners? And then just second, curious what happens when you close stores. I think you closed over 100 thus far. And curious what kind of sales transfer you see the nearby stores or online.Franklin R. BrackenYes. So to the first question -- actually, I'll start at the back end. So the majority of the store closures in 2Q really related to our Sidestep wind down. And so that was highly concentrated into the German marketplace. And so Foot Locker would have benefited the most from that. And we also were very intentional about a number of store conversions, which we actually rebranded to Foot Locker and then moved some of the better inventory over.So that's how we sort of mitigated the sales hit to the Sidestep wind down specifically in 2Q. As it relates to markdowns and where we're seeing some of the softness, certainly, lifestyle running as a sort of category has been the softest sort of spot in the footwear category. And that's the trend that's continued out of the first quarter and into the second quarter and something that we're going to continue to work through as we think about inventory management into the fall season.And so I'd say a large part of the markdown allowance has been geared towards liquidating some of those franchises. We continue to work with our brand partners on vendor allowance, on RTVs and also reflowing our order book in the back half. So I think there's been good partnership and recognition that we all want to end the year as cleanly as possible and sort of reset the inventory, particularly in North America for 2024.Mary N. DillonOkay. So let me wrap this up. I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. And I want to reemphasize that while this reset year has been tougher than we expected, I am really excited about the traction we're seeing with our Lace Up plan. And importantly, our entire team is energized and committed to the transformation that's taking place in the business and aligned with our strategies.I also just want to close by thanking our over 45,000 employees that are working hard to help us implement the strategy and the plan and get the stores on the website and DCs continue to be ready through our back-to-school in the busy holiday season, like only our stripers can. So we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you, and goodbye.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.]"

""So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.""A similar warning came this month from the world's largest retailer, Walmart.""Jobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers. But rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs and tightening lending standards, and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told Wall Street when the retailer reported earnings.Federal student loans will begin to accrue interest again on Sept. 1, with payments resuming on Oct. 1.Read more: Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could helpTransUnion's head of global research and consulting Charlie Wise tells Yahoo Finance that roughly 40 million consumers will face the ""payment shock"" when student debt relief ends.A man carries flowers and balloons during Los Angeles Mission College's 48th annual commencement ceremony on June 6, 2023. (Hans Gutknecht/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images via Getty Images)Consumers were already having trouble paying off credit card debt, as Macy's warned this week. Now, the return of student loan payments could make financial matters worse, with execs warning that the extra expense may lead consumers to pull back spending in other areas.Yahoo Finance takes a look at the consumer stocks with the most at risk.Retailers with most student loan payment exposureSome retailers appear more vulnerable to repayment shock than others heading into the crucial back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.Story continues""We are most cautious on brands with high exposure to student debt holders and inferior value perceptions amongst 18-34-year-olds, the most representative demographic of student debt holders,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients.The research team at TD Cowen highlighted Target (TGT) and Ulta (ULTA) as particularly vulnerable, due to their exposure to younger, low-income consumers with student loans.""The resumption of student loan repayments is one of many factors that we're watching really closely,"" Target CFO Michael Fiddelke told Yahoo Finance as the retailer slashed its full-year profit outlook.Other ""most-exposed"" stocks to younger, lower-income student borrowers, according to TD Cowen analysts, include Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), FIGS (FIGS), Foot Locker (FL), Burlington Stores (BURL), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote that US student debt borrowers will likely pull back spending on apparel overall since they ""prefer brands over private label and specialty retailers over discounters.""This is bad news for American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Carter's (CRI), Crocs (CROX), Canada Goose (GOOS), The Gap (GPS), Nordstrom (JWN), Nike (NKE), Steven Madden (SHOO), Under Armour (UAA), and Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. (VSCO), Sole said.Stores with a higher discretionary product mix also face higher risk, according to JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers.That includes Target and Ulta, Horvers noted, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Best Buy (BBY), followed by Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Costco (COST), and Walmart, with the primary difference driven by the former group's higher mix of discretionary product.On the flip side, auto parts stocks are less at risk ""given their lower-income exposure and low discretionary mix,"" Horvers wrote in a note to investors.Meanwhile, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) ""remains a question mark"" as its ""geo-weighted exposure to student loans ranks it high offset by its largely non-discretionary mix (85% grocery),"" Horvers added.Restaurants watch for sales weaknessWhen it comes to spending at restaurants, TD Cowen's Charles said he estimates up to ""a 2% annual headwind to restaurant industry spending as student loan payments resume.""The team at TD Cowen suggested Jack in the Box (JACK), Dutch Bros (BROS), and Sweetgreen (SG) may face headwinds. Investors should also tread lightly with tobacco and beverage brands, such as Altria Group (MO), British American Tobacco (BATS), and Monster Beverage (MNST).Even higher-end plays in the restaurant space aren't immune.Cava — where a salad bowl can set one back $14 — expressed caution on the consumer outlook in its latest earnings.CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance that student loan payments restarting was one of the ""multitude of factors"" up against consumers, along with higher gas prices, costly utility bills, and a ""hawkish Fed.""""So we're mindful of those pressures,"" Schulman said. ""We saw a resilient consumer in Q2, but we'd be remiss if we didn't take those considerations into account.""Of course, not all borrowers will have to pay right away.Those still in school remain ""in the regular forbearance period,"" TransUnion's Wise points out. ""But we think that about 26 million-27 million consumers will be facing the beginning or resumption of payments in the next couple of weeks.""There's another catch: The Department of Education is instituting a 12-month ""on-ramp"" for repayment from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024. Though interest will accrue during this period, financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments won't be considered delinquent or reported to credit bureaus and debt collectors.Cowen's Charles said in a note to clients this ""likely pushes any major impact to spending to late next year.""Are you an American with student loan debt or a company nervous about the return of student loan payments?

218,aa10a704-54c2-357f-9100-20d7ed111af4,WFC,2023-08-24,Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-company-wfc-attracting-130010757.html,1692795610,STORY,['WFC'],"[Wells Fargo (WFC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned -8.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has lost 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.86 points to a change of +54.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.72 indicates a change of -2.9% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate of $20.23 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.7%. The $81.31 billion and $79.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.2% and -2.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $20.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.6%. EPS of $1.25 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.28%. The EPS surprise was +8.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wells Fargo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""At the end of July, we successfully took the critical step of launching our first therapeutic drug in China, Xerava®, which is the world's first fluocycline antibiotic for the treatment of multi-drug resistant infections. To support Xerava's launch, we have built a lean and efficient commercial team of highly experienced professionals, which we will gradually scale up as we prepare for additional product debuts. Over the next 18-24 months, we expect to have three additional products approved in China.""""Being one of very few biotech companies with a substantial lineup of products prepared for launch over the next two years clearly demonstrates our expertise in selecting and commercializing promising drug candidates. We expect to receive NDA approvals from both China and Singapore in the second half of 2023 for Nefecon®, our first-in-disease treatment for adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and launch Nefecon® broadly in China in early 2024. We will also continue to broaden our product pipeline through our dual approach of in-licensing and internal discovery, targeting underserved conditions and areas of high unmet need with innovative and differentiated therapies. Through a series of measures to improve operational efficiency and restructure our strategic focus, we have significantly reduced expenses across different functions and narrowed net loss in the first six months of this year by more than a third compared to a year ago. This will allow Everest to continue to generate value for our stakeholders and shareholders,"" said Mr. Luo.Story continuesRecent Product Highlights and Anticipated MilestonesINFECTIOUS DISEASE PORTFOLIOEravacycline (Xerava®), is the world's first Fluorocycline antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by gram negative, gram positive and anaerobic pathogens including multidrug-resistant (""MDR"") isolates. Its current approved indication is cIAI in adult patients.Achievements during the Reporting Period:Post-Reporting Period achievements and expected milestones:Taniborbactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor (""BLI"") that, in combination with cefepime, may offer a potential treatment option for patients with serious bacterial infections caused by difficult-to-treat resistant gram-negative bacteria, most notably carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (""CRE"") and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (""CRPA"").Post-Reporting Period achievements and expected milestones:EVER206 (also known as SPR206), is a potentially best-in-class, novel polymyxin derivative designed to reduce toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity, compared to levels observed clinically with polymyxin B and colistin.Achievements during the Reporting Period:RENAL PORTFOLIONefecon®, our anchor drug candidate in the renal therapeutic area, is a patented oral, delayed release formulation of budesonide in development for the treatment of IgAN.Achievements during the Reporting Period:Post-Reporting Period achievements and expected milestones:AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE PORTFOLIOEtrasimod, is an oral, once-a-day, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator designed for optimized pharmacology and engagement of S1P receptors 1, 4, and 5. In addition to UC, it is being investigated for a range of other immuno-inflammatory diseases.Achievements during the Reporting Period:Post-Reporting Period achievements and expected milestones:mRNA PLATFORMEVER-COVID19-M1.2, is an Omicron-targeting bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine candidate.Achievements during the Reporting Period:CommercializationThe Company is committed to making its new therapeutics available to healthcare providers and patients as soon as possible. We have dedicated significant resources for the successful launch of Xerava® and facilitate our transition into a commercial-stage company. We have built a lean and efficient commercial team of highly experienced professionals covering two key therapeutic areas, infectious disease and renal diseases. As of June 30, 2023, our commercial team has 138 members, including key employees across sales, marketing, market access, medical affairs, distribution and commercial excellence.The Company also established multiple partnerships with China's leading pharmaceutical distributors, including SPH Keyuan Xinhai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Sinopharm Group, Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Chongqing Pharmaceutical Group and Shanghai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Under these partnerships, we will be able to leverage their industry-leading import and channel distribution networks to accelerate the commercialization of Xerava® in China.Nefecon® is expected to be the second product the Company commercializes in China. In April 2023, we introduced Nefecon® in China's Hainan Boao Pilot Zone to provide Chinese patients with IgAN early access to this innovative and first-in-disease therapy. Our early access program was well-received with over 500 patients signed up, highlighting the substantial unmet clinical needs of IgAN patients in China. Given the high prevalence of IgAN in China, our team is working diligently to have Nefecon® included in insurance programs to boost its affordability and accessibility, helping to alleviate patients' financial burden. As a result, in May 2023, the imported version of Nefecon® was added to the Beijing Puhui Health Insurance Program's 2023 New Reimbursement Drug List of Specialized Medicines, as well as other local insurance programs such as Kunming City and Shanxi Province. We expect to receive the NDA decision from China's NMPA in the second half of 2023 and launch Nefecon® broadly in China in early 2024.DiscoveryOur discovery pipeline focuses on novel targets for the treatment of renal diseases, and we expect to file an IND to enter clinical trials for our most advanced program in 2024. Additionally, with our clinically validated mRNA platform, we are advancing the discovovery and development of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases as well as therapeutic cancer vaccines for solid tumors.Business DevelopmentOur business development efforts focus on renal diseases and autoimmune disorders. We look to continue to bolster our leadership position in these areas by expanding our pipeline and ecosystem through a combination of internal discovery and in-licensing. We are actively engaged in finding business partnerships in these disease areas.As we previously reported, in August 2022 Immunomedics, Inc. (""Immunomedics""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc., agreed to acquire the Company's rights to Trodelvy® for total consideration of up to US$455 million, including US$280 million in upfront payments. The Company received the full upfront payments in late 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023, strengthening our balance sheet and empowering us to advance the development of products in our core therapeutic areas.Future DevelopmentWe will continue to pursue regulatory approvals for our innovative drug candidates, applying our effective dual approach of in-licensing and internal discovery to expand our existing robust pipeline. In the near-term, we expect to receive NDA approvals in China for three additional products, Nefecon®, etrasimod, and cefepime-taniborbactam. Notably, we are one of very few biotech companies expected to launch a broad lineup of products in the near term.Given the anticipated NDA approvals mentioned above, we have assembled a talented commercial team for the launch of Xerava® and Nefecon®. We will expand the team later this year as Nefecon®'s debut approaches, as well as in 2024 to establish deeper and broader hospital coverage.Financial HighlightsIFRS Numbers:Revenue increased by RMB7.9 million to RMB8.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2023 from the same period of a year ago, primarily due to the sales of Xerava and Trodelvy® during transition period with Gilead in Singapore.Research and development (""R&amp;D"") expenses decreased by RMB57.0 million from RMB345.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2022 to RMB288.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2023, primarily due to (i) a number of our drug candidates have completed clinical trials and advanced to regulatory submission or commercial stages; and (ii) the transfer of Trodelvy® clinical development activities to Gilead.General and administrative expenses decreased by RMB35.8 million from RMB118.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2022 to RMB83.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2023, mainly due to organization optimization and rationalization, and associated decrease in share-based compensation expenses.Distribution and selling expenses decreased by RMB84.1 million from RMB148.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2022 to RMB64.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2023, primarily due to the transfer of Trodelvy®-related commercial activities to Gilead and related optimization and rationalization of the organizational structure since August 2022.Net loss for the period decreased by RMB244.4 million from RMB668.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2022 to RMB423.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2023, primarily attributable to (i) a number of our drug candidates have completed clinical trials and advanced to the registration phase or commercial stages; (ii) the transfer of Trodelvy® related clinical and commercial activities to Gilead; and (iii) optimization and rationalization of the organizational structure.Cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits amounted to RMB2,540.2 million as of 30 June 2023.NON-IFRS MEASURE:Adjusted loss for the period decreased by RMB196.8 million from RMB523.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2022 to RMB326.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2023, primarily attributable to narrowed IFRS loss.Conference Call InformationThe English session of the conference call will be held at 9:00 AM on August 24, 2023 Beijing Time (9:00 PM U.S. Eastern Time on August 23, 2023) and the Mandarin session of the conference call will be held at 3:30 PM Beijing Time on the same day (3:30 AM U.S. Eastern Time on August 24, 2023).The conference calls can be accessed by the following links:For English Session:Time: 9:00 AM Beijing Time, Thursday, August 24, 2023Pre-Registration Link: https://www.acecamptech.com/eventDetail/60504030Webcast Link: https://www.acecamptech.com/meeting_live/70505775/4998?event_id=60504030Alternatively, participants may dial in to the conference call using below dial-in information:United States:+1-646-2543594(EN)Chinese Mainland:+86-10-58084166(EN)+86-10-58084199(CN)Hong Kong, China:+852-30051313(EN)+852-30051355(CN)United Kingdom:International:+44-20-76600166(EN)+1-866-6363243(EN)Password:756491For Mandarin Session:Time: 3:30 PM Beijing Time, Thursday, August 24, 2023Webcast Link: https://s.comein.cn/A12FLAlternatively, participants may dial into the conference call using below dial-in information:United States:+1-202-5524791Chinese Mainland:+86-400-188-8938+86-10-53827720+86-10-53560182Hong Kong, China:Taiwan, China:+852-57006920+886-277031747Singapore:+65-31586120United Kingdom:+44-2034816288Password:684433The replay of English session will be available shortly after the call and can be accessed by visiting the Company's website at http://www.everestmedicines.com.About Everest MedicinesEverest Medicines is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing transformative pharmaceutical products and vaccines that address critical unmet medical needs for patients in Asian markets.

This vaccine is yet to be authorized by the FDA.The vaccine has been designed to target the XBB descendent lineage viruses.Recently designated by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) as a variant of interest, Eris is the dominant variant in the United States. Per the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), the Eris variant is responsible for almost 21% of COVID-19 infections in the country.Infection cases from XBB.1.16.6 are also growing in the United States. The latest CDC data shows that this variant accounted for 8% of all cases nationwide.At an FDA committee meeting in June, Novavax presented preclinical data showing that its updated vaccine generated robust neutralizing antibodies against the key circulating XBB strains.Alongside its second-quarter 2023 results, Novavax announced that it had initiated a filing with the FDA for its updated COVID-19 vaccine and intends to submit one in Europe in the coming weeks. Management stated that it is manufacturing the updated vaccine commercially and planning to launch it in the upcoming fall.If approved/authorized, Novavax’s updated vaccine will be a non-mRNA XBB.1.5 vaccine available in the United States. The company aims to make its updated vaccine available and accessible on par with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines marketed by Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA.The rise in stock price can be attributed to the rising COVID-19 infection cases as new subvariants of the virus continue to emerge. Per the latest CDC data, total hospitalizations due to COVID-19 rose by almost 22% in the most recent week. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that the Biden administration will start a fall campaign urging all citizens to inoculate themselves with the updated COVID-19 vaccines.Story continuesShares of Novavax have lost 10.9% year to date compared with the industry’s 13.1% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith Novavax currently struggling with cash flow needs, a surge for COVID-19 vaccines will help the company generate additional cash resources to fund its business operations. In a recent filing with the SEC, management stated that they have sufficient cash to fund business for the next twelve months.Novavax is one of the few companies which has an authorized vaccine for COVID-19 in the United States. However, the company faces stiff competition from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which currently dominate the COVID vaccination space. These companies have also updated their COVID vaccines, which have demonstrated robust immune responses against the newer coronavirus variants.Last week, Moderna reported preliminary results from a clinical study showing that its updated COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273.815 significantly boosted neutralizing antibodies against the Eris and Fornax variants.Moderna has also submitted a regulatory application to the FDA seeking authorization for mRNA-1273.815. A final FDA decision is expected in the coming weeks for the vaccine’s launch for the upcoming fall season. A similar regulatory submission is also currently under review in Europe.In June, Pfizer/BioNTech submitted filings in the United States and Europe seeking approval for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. If approved, the companies intend to launch their vaccine for the fall season. Last week, Reuters reported that the updated BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine was effective against the Eris variant in a study conducted on mice. The companies expect to prepare their updated vaccine for supply immediately post-regulatory approvals.Novavax, Inc. Price Novavax, Inc. PriceNovavax, Inc. price | Novavax, Inc.

222,27ded5cd-ce35-36d0-aa17-09ce1f2de4ef,FOXA,2023-08-24,Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-corporation-nasdaq-foxa-goes-100331838.html,1692871411,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Fox's shares on or after the 29th of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 27th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.26 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.52 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Fox has a trailing yield of 1.6% on the current share price of $32.94. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Fox's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Fox If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fox paid out just 21% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 21% of its cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Fox's earnings per share have dropped 6.4% a year over the past five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Fox has delivered 3.1% dividend growth per year on average over the past four years.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Fox for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share are down meaningfully, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend needs to be cut. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.While it's tempting to invest in Fox for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Fox and you should be aware of it before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

The study, Augmented work for an automated, AI-driven world, surveyed, 3,000 global C-suite executives across 20 industries and 28 countries.IBM Corporation logo.

""As AI becomes more pervasive and adoption accelerates across business, it is critical for leaders to set a plan which leverages people as a core competitive advantage. Taking these steps now in Canada is critical to ensure our industries and organizations maintain leadership and are not left behind.""Canadian business leaders keen to prepare for AI in businessCanadian executives surveyed ranked technology illiteracy as a top talent issue, which was ranked second among global executives.Canadian executives surveyed also confirmed building new skills for existing talent is another important challenge to the organization, closely aligned with the top global challenges.58 per cent of Canadian executives are investing in reskilling internally as opposed to hiring from outside (43 per cent).Canadian executives report people skills like time management and the ability to prioritize (44 per cent), analytics skills with business acumen (41 per cent) and ethics and integrity (39 per cent) are most important today.Story continuesMassive Opportunity for HR leaders as Canadian businesses embrace AIThe study provided recommendations for leaders to address talent challenges in the era of AI and help their organizations transform for the future, including a focus on skills and operating models. Top recommendations included:Put skills at the center of workforce strategy—for today and for tomorrow. Leaders should be thinking about how to increase the overall technical acumen of the workforce. That can serve as a broad foundation upon which employees build new skills, such as how to work creatively and responsibly with AI. It's very important for employees to have a basic understanding of AI and its capabilities so they can be both critical thinkers and users of the technology. The future pipeline of talent is an important consideration too. The global AI skills gap is an urgent need facing many companies today across industries, and this will require strategic investments.Invest in talent as much as technology, preparing the workforce for AI and other technology disruption. HR leaders will drive workforce planning, design, and strategy, like defining higher-value work, identifying the critical roles and skills of the future, and managing hiring, shifting people into new roles, retention and more. Including reviewing roles, identifying, and eliminating repetitive tasks that can be handled by AI, merging roles to create new roles, expanding roles to include tasks like applying or managing AI tools, and creating targeted skill development for the higher-level tasks driven by people.Redesign the work, leading with the operating model.  Re-think and re-engineer how work gets done, identifying tasks where AI or automation can be applied to free up employee time for higher value tasks where their touch is critical. For example, IBM's HR team re-examined the highly manual and data-intensive quarterly promotions process, applying a custom Watson Orchestrate solution to automate data gathering and thereby empowering human staff to devote more time to high-value tasks.Give jobs more meaning by putting the employee in the driver's seat. AI has the potential to transform the employee experience. It can automate repetitive tasks, letting people focus on what they are passionate about, freeing up their time for skills development or work-life balance, and potentially create exciting new job roles and career paths.

The transaction for an undisclosed amount is likely to close by the end of first-quarter 2024, subject to the fulfillment of regulatory approvals and other mandatory closing conditions.In 2015, IBM acquired The Weather Company to leverage its own cloud infrastructure to provide accurate weather forecasts around the globe that aggregate more than 25 billion forecasts a day. The company expected to profit from the wave of data-crunching software by improving the Weather Company’s modeling technology and developing a new generation of predictive applications for incremental revenues.However, over a period of time, IBM has streamlined its operations to focus on its core hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence businesses. It has spun off its legacy Managed Infrastructure Services business in a bid to accelerate its hybrid cloud growth strategy, focusing on enabling clients with accelerated digital transformation. It has further restructured its segments post the separation of its managed infrastructure services business from Kyndryl.The Weather Company's assets set to be acquired by Francisco Partners include digital consumer-facing offerings, The Weather Channel mobile and cloud-based digital properties including Weather.com, Weather Underground and Storm Radar. It will also own the enterprise offerings for broadcast, media, aviation, advertising technology and data solutions for other emerging industries.IBM, however, will retain the sustainability software business, including its Environmental Intelligence Suite (EIS), to help clients curate, measure, report and operationalize ESG (Environment Social and Governance) data for informed decision making. It intends to continue leveraging The Weather Company's weather data for EIS for tracking changes in land use, monitoring natural disasters and predicting crop yields.Since its inception about two decades ago, Francisco Partners has invested in more than 400 technology firms to provide the best possible products and services for its customers and partners. This global investment firm is expected to replicate the same investment focus in The Weather Company to bring new tools and offer greater value to its customers.IBM expects growth to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security services. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities will likely drive its profitability.The company has expanded its partner relationships in AI, network automation and security to help the telecommunications industry evolve as 5G and Edge Computing take center stage.

That spurred a wave of media discourse fueled by trash-talking between the two tech moguls.While the match appears to have been called off, with Zuckerberg recently posting on Threads, ""I think it's time to move on,"" both revealed a common denominator: their apparent deep appreciation for Brazilian jujitsu, a self-defense martial art emphasizing grappling and ground fighting.I’m up for a cage match if he is lol— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 21, 2023Zuckerberg was recently promoted to a blue belt in jujitsu. Meanwhile, Musk practiced jujitsu in an impromptu session with Lex Fridman, a black belt, computer scientist, and podcaster.Silicon Valley more broadly has an extensive jujitsu community, too.So how have we gotten to a place where tech billionaires, who could do absolutely anything in their spare time, are willing to beat each other up? Yahoo Finance spoke to three jujitsu experts about why tech wealth is funneling into the martial art.A photo illustration of two people practicing jujitsu overlaid with a quote from a black belt instructor.David and GoliathAs it turns out, jujitsu and tech have a lot in common.First, there's an inherent underdog paradigm, one that parallels tech's frequent disruptor versus incumbent narratives. According to jujitsu black belt instructor Rener Gracie, anyone can prevail in a match with ""technique, timing, leverage, and distance management,"" even over stronger opponents.""Jujitsu can enable anyone to be David against their own Goliath, ... and that extends beyond combat,"" said Gracie, who recently authored a book called ""The 32 Principles: Harnessing the Power of Jiu-Jitsu to Succeed in Business, Relationships, and Life.""Story continuesAnd in tech, that David vs. Goliath story of smaller companies innovating better to beat giants holds a lot of power.Just look at Zuck, who pulled all-nighters at Facebook to squash the larger MySpace. As for Musk, he took on credit card giants like American Express when co-founding PayPal and now has taken on behemoths Ford and General Motors at Tesla.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg practices jujitsu in his backyard Octagon. (Photo by Mark Zuckerberg, posted on Threads)""If you saw two people fighting and they're in a scuffle on the ground, and one person is on top and the other is on the bottom, you're conditioned to think the person on the bottom is losing the fight,"" Gracie explained. ""In jujitsu, not only is that not true, but in many senses the opposite is true. ... Jujitsu teaches us how to win in worst-case scenarios, the sort where you can be on the bottom against a giant and not only defend yourself but prevail.""Beyond combatThe deep creative side of tech powerbrokers also has tie-ins with jujitsu principles. Like tech, jujitsu is fundamentally about experimentation, said Chris Matakas, a jujitsu black belt instructor, performance coach, and author.""Jujitsu is like an exercise in the scientific method,"" he said. ""You're in there, you're training with somebody, and you have a goal. So you enact a movement toward that goal, and you encounter resistance. Pretty much all jujitsu is running an experiment, and you get immediate feedback on whether or not that experiment was successful. ... It's really problem-solving training, which has such a huge carryover.""Rites of passage, such as the belt promotion that Zuckerberg went through earlier this year, also have appeal in Silicon Valley's insular and hierarchical tech ecosystem, which has its own language of growth, VCs, and coding.""We're social animals, and jujitsu really hits it out of the park when it comes to forging these tribal bonds and providing rites of passage,"" said jujitsu expert Roy Dean, who is writing a book called ""Mentorship and Mastery.""Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a jujitsu training session. (Photo by Lex Fridman, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter)'Reality reinforcement' for billionairesThough running a tech company and performing jujitsu share many similarities, the differences also matter — and they may be another draw for ego-centric tech billionaires.For one, in a world where tech billionaires can buy almost anything, you can't buy the skill represented by a jujitsu belt, Dean told Yahoo Finance. In an industry that believes in its own meritocracy like tech does, that's highly appealing.""If you're a rich tech person, how can you continue to distinguish yourself? One of the ways is through physical literacy and mastery,"" Dean continued. ""There's a lot of lying you can do in this life, but this sort of jujitsu-style ground fighting is a reality reinforcement device. If you lose on the mat, you lose, even if you gave it your best effort.""Jujitsu can also get extreme, which can be humbling for even the most successful tech moguls. That's a handy attribute for a tech billionaire, who may have lost it in their rise to self-described greatness.""The goal is to make your partner 'tap,'"" Matakas said. ""What a tap means is, hey, if we were really fighting, you'd have killed me. So there's an element of humility, where to get from a white belt to a black belt, you'd have to have been 'killed' thousands of times. By the time you get there, you can't think too highly of yourself.""Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg are ready to fight, offline. (Manu Fernandez, Stephan Savoia/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Silicon Valley schoolyardWith the Tech Titans Cage Match put off indefinitely, we may never know for sure who is the better fighter.But to Dean, the smart money would be on the blue belt, Zuckerberg, who has already begun his jujitsu journey, a practice that takes years to learn.""It's not about Zuckerberg trying to one-up somebody to reaffirm his masculinity,"" Dean said. ""He's fascinated by the art and wants to glorify the art by doing charity, showing his progress, giving credit to his teacher.""As for Musk, his impulse toward extreme responses that vary in facetiousness — for example, his recent offer to show up at random for a fight at Zuckerberg's home — may not be particularly well suited to jujitsu.Much of jujitsu is about calibrating responses ""perfectly and justly,"" Dean said, and actually injuring anyone in training or full-blown sparring is frowned upon.""For Musk, it's schoolyard, gauche: 'If I can't beat him this way, I'll find another way,'"" Dean added.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Theile estimates that 55 days worth of vehicle inventory won't be enough ""to [withstand] a very long strike.""Theile considers the impact a potential strike could have on the U.S. economy and the outlook for contract resolutions between union workers and employers.Video Transcript- All right, it's been called the summer of strikes. And while UPS averted a walkout, America's largest automakers are in the middle of a contract battle. And it may not have a happy ending. Members of the United Auto Workers union are in the process of voting to authorize the strike when their current contract expires on September 14.And the economic fallout could be massive. An estimate from the Anderson Economic Group says a 10-day stoppage could cost $5 billion. Joining us now is Tyler Thiele, Anderson Economic Group vice president. So paint the picture for us about what this potential economic fallout could be. So, of course, we're talking about lost wages. What else are-- what other areas of the economy are we expecting to be impacted?TYLER THEILE: Certainly. So lost wages are, of course, the largest numerical value loss that we look at when we assess an economic impact of this nature. However, right now, compared to, for example, the UAW strike in 2019, the economy and the auto industry looks different than it did four years ago.Sales environment is different. Prices are different. Inventory is different. And so we see in this strike potential the opportunity for stronger and greater losses to dealers and consumers on top of, of course, company losses to Stellantis, GM, and Ford.Story continues- So Tyler, let's break that down a little bit further. You talk about the fact that it could impact the automakers, consumers, and also dealers. Let's start specifically with consumers because a lot of people are asking, hey, what could this mean for me if I'm going out to buy a car? What does that look like and, I guess, the timeline of that? Because a lot of it, I would think, depends on how long this strike goes on for potentially.TYLER THEILE: Certainly. So back in 2019, if you'll recall, the GM strike lasted 42 days. That caused, if you look back at the seasonally adjusted data, a single quarter recession in the state of Michigan because the auto industry is so strongly represented.But back then, we had about five times the vehicle inventory that we do today granted that ranges widely from vehicle to vehicle, brand to brand. However, right now, on average, we're hovering at around 55 days inventory. And so that's certainly not enough to withstand a very long strike.- And given what the historical data shows you, what does your data show you about expectations for how long a strike could last this time around?TYLER THEILE: Well, you know, the talks and the rhetoric leading up to this strike have been different as well. In the past, we've seen the UAW strategy be to target only one of the big three OEMs in Detroit. And we certainly saw that four years ago with the GM strike.However, in this case, you know, I read recently with record profits, employees would like to see record-breaking contracts. And if they have the motivation to strike at all three of our big three OEMs, it would just be a completely different picture, a much stronger impact in the economy. And when we add up a total economic impact, for example, it is not just GM plus Ford plus Stellantis, the industry multiplier required grows at that rate because there is a stronger impact to the industry as a whole.- Tyler, the approach to the talks this time around with President Shawn Fain at the helm of UAW, how has that differed? When we talk about the approach and the potential outcome with all three striking with the UAW striking against all three of the automakers versus what has happened in the past. What do you attribute that to? And I guess, how big of a deal or how much more of that loss could be as a result?TYLER THEILE: Certainly, Well, the way he has built it up could almost set the stage for disappointment if there is not a strike at all three. And I don't mean to have that be taken the wrong way. But when you almost guarantee that you're going to strike it all three, doing anything less could disappoint his members.- And I want to ask you, Tyler, is the potential that this may end up being much ado about nothing and that their isn't a strike ultimately, that they come to the table and come to some kind of resolution?TYLER THEILE: That would certainly be ideal if they can have productive negotiations between now and the middle of September and come up with contracts that make the workers feel like they are being appropriately paid. But also really importantly for consumers and auto dealers across the country, contracts that are actually sustainable for the OEMs so that we can see a stable automotive industry, especially right now while we're in the midst of electric vehicle transition, very high interest rates on car loans. We just can't potentially withstand the long strike with the resilience that we did four years ago today.- Well, we will certainly be watching this space. We've talked a lot about strikes this summer. We will see what comes to pass when it comes to UAW and the deadline coming up middle of September. Thanks so much, Tyler Thiele of Anderson Economic Group. Thank]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after investigating McCormick (NYSE:MKC), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on McCormick is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.095 = US$988m ÷ (US$13b - US$2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2023).Thus, McCormick has an ROCE of 9.5%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Food industry average of 11%. See our latest analysis for McCormick roceIn the above chart we have measured McCormick's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for McCormick.How Are Returns Trending?The returns on capital haven't changed much for McCormick in recent years. The company has consistently earned 9.5% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 22% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.In Conclusion...In summary, McCormick has simply been reinvesting capital and generating the same low rate of return as before. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 45% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing McCormick, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.While McCormick isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

In July, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With consolidated passenger traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (the percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 83.4% from 80.8% in June 2022. The number of flight departures at GOL in July registered a 10.6% year-over-year jump. Consolidated passengers on board rose 14.5% year over year.Continued recovery in air-travel demand in Brazil bodes well for Gol Linhas. In second-quarter 2023, revenues from passenger transportation, accounting for 89.7% of total revenues, rose 24.2%, thanks to continued recovery in air-travel demand in Brazil. Gol Linhas transported 7 million passengers in the second quarter, up 19.9% from the year-ago number. Strong air-travel demand is likely to aid third-quarter results as well. Backed by a continued recovery in leisure travel demand and a rise in international travel, we expect third-quarter passenger unit revenues to improve year over year.Declining fuel prices should boost Gol Linhas’ bottom line. Average fuel price per liter declined 22.2% year over year in the second quarter of 2023. Cost per available seat kilometer also fell 7.9% year over year in the second quarter. For 2023, GOL now expects the fuel price per liter to be R$5.1 (prior view: R$5.4).Despite such headwinds, GOL's liquidity position is a concern. Cash and cash equivalent of $137 million at the second quarter of 2023-end was lower than the $3,782 million of long-term debt. This implies that the company does not have enough cash to meet its debt burden.Story continuesZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Gol Linhas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation – Airline industry can consider United Airlines (UAL) and SkyWest, Inc.

Fuel expenses continue to act as a major concern for the company's bottom line.Apart from the increase in fuel costs, a rise in labor and airport costs is likely to dent bottom-line growth by resulting in a spike in operating expenses.

This rise is likely to get reflected in the bottom-line results of the third quarter.The approval of the deal, which is valued at $9.6 billion over its tenure, makes AAL’s pilots eligible for an immediate pay raise in excess of 21%, on average, as it includes roughly $1.1 billion in immediate, one-time payments and ratification bonuses. The deal also has provisions for retroactive pay for the first four months of 2023. This implies that $230 million will get reflected as additional expenses in the September-quarter results.Including the expenditures associated with the deal, American Airlines now expects third-quarter cost per available seat mile excluding fuel and net special items or CASM-ex to rise in the 4-6% band on a year-over-year basis (prior guidance: 2-4% year-over-year jump).However, full-year 2023 guidance for the metric (even after including the pilot-deal related costs) remains the same due to changes in the projected timing of other expense items. Evidently, CASM-ex for 2023 is still forecast to climb in the range of 2-4%.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAmerican Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like United Airlines UAL and Air Transport Services ATSG. Each stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Owing to this, UAL suggests revenues for the September quarter to grow 10-13% year over year. Our projection for the metric hints at an increase of 11.4% year over year.For third-quarter 2023, United Airlines anticipates capacity to improve 16% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL’s current-year earnings has been revised 19.7% upward over the past 60 days.Story continuesThe uptrend with respect to e-commerce even in the post-pandemic scenario is a huge positive for Air Transport Services. It is the primary driver behind the uptick in demand for midsize air freighters.With shippers replacing their older, less fuel-efficient equipment, ATSG’s freighters have emerged as suitable replacements. Driven by the upbeat demand, ATSG has delivered a record six converted freighters under lease in a month to its customers worldwide. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ATSG’s current-year earnings has been revised 11.2% north in the past 60 days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.4% on +3.2% higher revenues.The somewhat mixed showing from the traditional retailers in their Q2 earnings reports was primarily due to management execution and less a function of any significant moderation in consumer spending.We discussed Target TGT last week, which missed top-line and comp estimates but did better on margins and inventories. We noted that while management appeared satisfied with current inventory levels, investors will be justified in wondering whether Target has really addressed the issue if Q2’s weak sales and traffic trends will result in unsold inventory in the coming periods.Story continuesUnlike Walmart WMT, whose quarterly report showed all-around strength, Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Walmart stumbled last year following its Q1 report, as did Target, but it recovered quickly. In its Q2 report, Walmart benefited from broad market share gains and momentum in key growth initiatives.While Walmart has a much bigger grocery business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise, demand for which has moderated in the post-Covid period. That said, Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 96% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.2023 Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -2.0%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.The long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either.These growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions.

""So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.""A similar warning came this month from the world's largest retailer, Walmart.""Jobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers. But rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs and tightening lending standards, and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told Wall Street when the retailer reported earnings.Federal student loans will begin to accrue interest again on Sept. 1, with payments resuming on Oct. 1.Read more: Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could helpTransUnion's head of global research and consulting Charlie Wise tells Yahoo Finance that roughly 40 million consumers will face the ""payment shock"" when student debt relief ends.A man carries flowers and balloons during Los Angeles Mission College's 48th annual commencement ceremony on June 6, 2023. (Hans Gutknecht/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images via Getty Images)Consumers were already having trouble paying off credit card debt, as Macy's warned this week. Now, the return of student loan payments could make financial matters worse, with execs warning that the extra expense may lead consumers to pull back spending in other areas.Yahoo Finance takes a look at the consumer stocks with the most at risk.Retailers with most student loan payment exposureSome retailers appear more vulnerable to repayment shock than others heading into the crucial back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.Story continues""We are most cautious on brands with high exposure to student debt holders and inferior value perceptions amongst 18-34-year-olds, the most representative demographic of student debt holders,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients.The research team at TD Cowen highlighted Target (TGT) and Ulta (ULTA) as particularly vulnerable, due to their exposure to younger, low-income consumers with student loans.""The resumption of student loan repayments is one of many factors that we're watching really closely,"" Target CFO Michael Fiddelke told Yahoo Finance as the retailer slashed its full-year profit outlook.Other ""most-exposed"" stocks to younger, lower-income student borrowers, according to TD Cowen analysts, include Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), FIGS (FIGS), Foot Locker (FL), Burlington Stores (BURL), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote that US student debt borrowers will likely pull back spending on apparel overall since they ""prefer brands over private label and specialty retailers over discounters.""This is bad news for American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Carter's (CRI), Crocs (CROX), Canada Goose (GOOS), The Gap (GPS), Nordstrom (JWN), Nike (NKE), Steven Madden (SHOO), Under Armour (UAA), and Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. (VSCO), Sole said.Stores with a higher discretionary product mix also face higher risk, according to JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers.That includes Target and Ulta, Horvers noted, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Best Buy (BBY), followed by Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Costco (COST), and Walmart, with the primary difference driven by the former group's higher mix of discretionary product.On the flip side, auto parts stocks are less at risk ""given their lower-income exposure and low discretionary mix,"" Horvers wrote in a note to investors.Meanwhile, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) ""remains a question mark"" as its ""geo-weighted exposure to student loans ranks it high offset by its largely non-discretionary mix (85% grocery),"" Horvers added.Restaurants watch for sales weaknessWhen it comes to spending at restaurants, TD Cowen's Charles said he estimates up to ""a 2% annual headwind to restaurant industry spending as student loan payments resume.""The team at TD Cowen suggested Jack in the Box (JACK), Dutch Bros (BROS), and Sweetgreen (SG) may face headwinds. Investors should also tread lightly with tobacco and beverage brands, such as Altria Group (MO), British American Tobacco (BATS), and Monster Beverage (MNST).Even higher-end plays in the restaurant space aren't immune.Cava — where a salad bowl can set one back $14 — expressed caution on the consumer outlook in its latest earnings.CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance that student loan payments restarting was one of the ""multitude of factors"" up against consumers, along with higher gas prices, costly utility bills, and a ""hawkish Fed.""""So we're mindful of those pressures,"" Schulman said. ""We saw a resilient consumer in Q2, but we'd be remiss if we didn't take those considerations into account.""Of course, not all borrowers will have to pay right away.Those still in school remain ""in the regular forbearance period,"" TransUnion's Wise points out. ""But we think that about 26 million-27 million consumers will be facing the beginning or resumption of payments in the next couple of weeks.""There's another catch: The Department of Education is instituting a 12-month ""on-ramp"" for repayment from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024. Though interest will accrue during this period, financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments won't be considered delinquent or reported to credit bureaus and debt collectors.Cowen's Charles said in a note to clients this ""likely pushes any major impact to spending to late next year.""Are you an American with student loan debt or a company nervous about the return of student loan payments?

258,31744e0c-4077-365c-b8b8-5b1b11b34f3e,TGT,2023-08-24,Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-wall-street-lower-ratings-174349282.html,1692812629,STORY,"['BAC', 'G', 'BZ', 'PODD', 'XEL', 'TGT', 'CERT']","[In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks recently downgraded by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.On August 23, stocks and bonds rose as economic data supported the idea that major central banks might halt interest rate increases to avoid a recession. Before Nvidia Corp.'s earnings report, there were notable gains in the stock market, primarily driven by the performance of major tech companies. Additionally, a US government report suggested that the downward revision of job growth in the year leading up to March might be around 306,000 jobs, a smaller correction than some economists had predicted. In response to data indicating limited customer demand, US business activity saw minimal expansion, causing two-year Treasury yields to decrease by 10 basis points, falling below 5%. Simultaneously, the 10-year German interest rate declined due to a heightened contraction in private-sector activity across the euro area. US new-home sales surged in July, reaching the highest point in more than a year due to ongoing advantages for homebuilders caused by limited supply in the resale market. Purchases of new single-family homes notably grew by 4.4% last month, totaling an annualized rate of 714,000, although this figure was adjusted downward for previous months. Government data released on Wednesday revealed these figures, surpassing the median prediction of 703,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Furthermore, a gauge of backlogs saw a reduction, hitting its lowest level for this year.According to a report from CNBC, economic conditions in Europe have worsened, with recent data indicating the lowest levels since April 2013, excluding Covid-affected months. The eurozone, comprised of 20 nations sharing the same currency, grew 0.3% in Q2 and 0.1% in Q1. Analysts polled by Refinitiv predict that the European Central Bank will likely maintain its current main rate of 3.75%. Business activity in Europe contracted further in August, reaching its lowest point since November 2020. The flash composite purchasing managers' index for the eurozone fell to 47.0 in August from July's 48.6, missing the expected 48.8. Figures above 50 signify growth, while figures below 50 indicate contraction. Excluding Covid-impacted months, this data indicates the weakest reading since April 2013. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, noted that the service sector's decline matches the struggling manufacturing performance. The services PMI hit a 30-month low at 48.3, while manufacturing PMI slightly improved from 42.7 in July to 43.7 this month. Based on PMI figures, Rubia projected a 0.2% contraction for the eurozone in Q3. The region's growth was 0.3% in Q2 and 0.1% in Q1, influenced by higher interest rates, energy costs, and subdued external demand. Differences within the region are evident, with Germany experiencing a significant business activity decline in August. This data shapes discussions on the European Central Bank's upcoming decisions. After the July meeting, President Christine Lagarde suggested potential rate hikes or pauses hinging on new data.Story continuesOn the precious metals market side, gold prices rose significantly by 1%, reaching a high point that hasn't been seen in two weeks. This increase can be attributed to the decline in U.S. bond yields and a slight dollar weakening. As investors eagerly anticipate the Jackson Hole symposium, they seek insights into potential interest rate shifts. The current value of spot gold stands at $1,916.50 per ounce, and U.S. gold futures experienced a notable 1.1% rise, reaching $1,946.30. Of note, the flash U.S. composite PMI revealed that business growth in the United States has been sluggish in August, particularly within the service sector. All eyes are now directed toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium. This speech is anticipated to provide valuable cues regarding the trajectory of interest rates. According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, there is a strong 88.5% likelihood that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current rates during the upcoming September meeting. It's important to understand that gold's responsiveness to increasing U.S. interest rates is grounded in opportunity cost. As interest rates rise, the cost of holding assets that don't yield returns, like gold, becomes relatively higher. This dynamic often impacts the demand for gold. Moreover, the wider precious metals market saw positive movement. Notably, spot silver recorded a gain of 3.4%, bringing it to $24.18 per ounce. Similarly, platinum experienced an increase of 1.8%, reaching $934.79, and palladium rose by 1.9%, reaching $1,285. This overall upward movement in precious metals aligns with the ongoing market trends.On the stocks market front, notable stocks such as Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ:CERT) were downgraded by analysts, among many others. Check out the complete article to see some other stocks recently downgraded by analysts.Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks10. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: +1.22 (+0.62%)On August 21, Baird downgraded Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) rating from ""Outperform"" to ""Neutral"" and lowered the price target from $320 to $219. This change follows a survey of 25 endocrinologists who were asked about the use of GLP-1 in type two diabetes management. The downgrade reflects a more cautious outlook based on insights from the survey, suggesting a potential shift in Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) market dynamics and growth prospects.The Ithaka Group made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) is a medical device company focused on the design, development and commercialization of insulin pump systems for people with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. Insulet’s insulin pump system is superior to traditional multiple daily injections because it provides its users with a more accurate and pain free way to administer insulin when compared to injecting it via syringe multiple times per day. Insulet’s stock was under pressure following news that Medtronic purchased EOFlow, the manufacturer of the EOPatch, a tubeless, wearable and fully disposable insulin delivery device. While the EOPatch is not yet launched in the US, it is widely believed it will be available by the end of 2024, increasing competitive pressure on Insulet.”09. Kanzhun Limited (NASDAQ:BZ)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: 0.00 (0.00%)Kanzhun Limited (NASDAQ:BZ) runs BOSS Zhipin, an online job search platform that connects job seekers with employers. The company generates revenue by providing recruitment services to job seekers and enterprise clients through its mobile apps and websites. On August 22, Macquarie analyst Danny Lee significantly adjusted his stance on Kanzhun Limited (NASDAQ:BZ). Previously having held an 'outperform' rating for the company, Lee has now revised his recommendation to 'neutral'. This modification could indicate a shift in Lee's assessment of Kanzhun's future performance and market dynamics. Such changes in analyst recommendations can carry substantial implications for investors as they reflect the evolving perceptions and insights within the financial industry. Similar to Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ:CERT), Kanzhun Limited (NASDAQ:BZ) is yet another stock that has recently faced analyst downgrades.08. Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.01 (-0.02%)Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) has shown minimal movement in the trading session on August 22 due to an announcement from Bank of America. The bank has decided to downgrade the stock's rating from 'Buy' to 'Neutral', accompanied by a notable adjustment in the price target. Previously set at $72, the new target now is $60. This decision comes in light of recent challenges faced by Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) in regulatory matters within Minnesota and Colorado. These regulatory setbacks could have impacted the company's operational outlook and strategic trajectory. Additionally, the potential liabilities associated with wildfires have raised concerns, prompting a reevaluation of the stock's investment potential. Bank of America's rating change highlights their reassessment of Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) short to mid-term prospects. The shift from a 'Buy' to a 'Neutral' recommendation could reflect Bank of America's view that the stock's previous upside potential might now be more tempered due to the regulatory hurdles and potential financial risks linked to wildfire liabilities.07. Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -1.50 (-0.77%)On August 21, TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza downgraded Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR), moving from an 'Outperform' to a 'Market Perform' rating, lowering the price target from $200 to $194. This shift led to around 0.77% drop in Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR) stock on August 22. Vitanza cited the company's recent substantial surge in value, alongside weaker global economic growth affecting demand for finished steel products and coking coal indices. Despite acknowledging Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR) strong management and prudent cash flow distribution, Vitanza's decision was influenced by the significant reduction in the gap between the stock price and the value determined through discounted cash flow analysis. Much like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ:CERT), Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR) is now part of the group of companies experiencing recent analyst downgrades. This occurrence suggests a broader trend where analysts are reassessing their outlook on various stocks.06. Genpact Limited (NYSE:G)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.39 (-1.07%)On August 22, a significant alteration emerged in the evaluation of Genpact Limited (NYSE:G) by an analyst from JPMorgan. Previously maintaining a 'neutral' rating on the stock, the analyst has now opted for a more cautious stance by downgrading it to an 'underweight' rating. This adjustment in the analyst's perspective could suggest a heightened concern about the stock's near-term performance and the potential challenges it might face.In conjunction with this change in rating, the JPMorgan analyst has introduced a new price target of $40. This figure indicates the level at which they anticipate the stock to perform in the future, and it is notably lower than the stock's current trading value. Establishing this new price target reflects the analyst's recalibration of their expectations for Genpact Limited (NYSE:G) value and growth trajectory.Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Genpact Limited (NYSE:G) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We purchased two new positions during the quarter: Genpact Limited (NYSE:G) and Dun &amp; Bradstreet Holdings Inc. Genpact is an IT services company that was spun out of General Electric several years ago. Genpact focuses on business process outsourcing (BPO) and technology digitalization markets. It has a diverse client base that is spread across multiple industries. Complexity within the IT space is growing rapidly, and Genpact plays an important role in helping customers navigate the complexity. We have owned Genpact in the past and are happy to have the opportunity to own it once again.”Click to continue reading and see Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.

BlackRock Global Fixed Income Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the state of the consumer.Rieder says ""the consumer is still in pretty good shape,"" given the current unemployment rate, wages, and savings rate. Rieder explains that ""consumers are definitely moving more to experiences… that is a cultural shift."" Rieder says the middle to higher-end consumer ""is doing quite well today,"" however the ""lower end"" is ""tricky"" and ""having a harder time."" ""There are a ton of trends underneath the surface and you’re seeing that play out in these earnings numbers,"" Rieder says.Video Transcript- Consumer softness on discretionary items, though that has been the trend for retailers this quarter. For more, let's bring back in Rick Rieder, BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer. Not sure what your stance is on ripped jeans or holey pants, but--RICK RIEDER: I still wear ripped jeans. Is it out of style? I don't know. I like it. They're comfortable.- I guess they're good for lawn work, too, sometimes. But at the end of the day, when you kind of think about the health of the consumer right now-- we've continued to hear time after time again, whether it's from the banks to start off this earnings season that household balance sheets are just fine, whether it's some of the core categories that consumers have to buy into necessities.They're saying that the consumer is resilient. But now, once you get into some of these discretionary categories, it's a different picture that's being painted.RICK RIEDER: So listen, I think the consumer is still in pretty good shape. I mean, a 3 and 1/2% unemployment rate with good wages and you've had savings rates. It's coming down, but savings are still-- I mean, you still have a trillion and a half in savings. So I think this consumer's in a good place.Story continuesWhen you break it down, you look at what's happening in travel and leisure, consumers are definitely moving more to experiences. That is-- I think that is a cultural shift. And coming out of COVID, they spend an awful lot on goods, an awful lot on apparel, an awful lot on electronics and furniture.That has been-- you don't need to do that again. And so I think there's a shift at play. And so we went through credit-- we go through a ton of credit card data, understand what's happening in the world. We went through it today. The bifurcation between-- and this gets back to the Fed and what's happening, lower income is struggling.Higher end is doing-- middle to higher end is actually-- and the consumer is doing quite well today. It's, again, higher interest rates, booey savings for those that are savers. But it's the lower end that's tricky and then it's having a harder time. So there are a ton of trends underneath the surface, and you're seeing that play out in these earnings numbers.- So I wanted to zero in on something you said earlier that also caught my eye yesterday from the Macy's statement, where they talked about delinquencies-- credit-- because they have store cards. Delinquencies on those cards ticking up more quickly than they anticipated.So this morning, I was looking at the overall delinquency numbers. We have them up on the screen. This is only as recent as the second quarter. I don't think we have fresher data than that. You see it's starting to slope up again. It's still kind of in line with where we were pre-pandemic.And then I was also looking at the non-housing debt for households, right? And those are also going pretty much up into the right across the board. So in this period of rising rates, how high are those delinquencies going to get? How much is spending going to get pinched as a result of this heavy debt load?RICK RIEDER: Yeah, I mean, it's going to pick up. I mean, my sense is the consumer-- so if you think about what's happened in the last few years, the consumer generally has delevered, paid down the home. They've generally-- you're starting from a base of credit card borrowing that's still pretty low. So consumer is still pretty delevered relative to what it's been in history.And this is why you're having this big bifurcation. It's the lower end. And this is part of this dynamic. If unemployment starts to tick up, that's when you're going to start to see it. There's only a very interesting thing that you don't see over time. Consumers have locked in their mortgages at 3%, 3 and 1/2%.So you see housing activity is incredibly low. If, so let's just say, unemployment starts to tick higher. And then, all of a sudden, people have to sell their homes where the mortgage rate is too high This is where you can get into a really tricky period, part of what I think we need to stabilize here and let things settle in because that becomes difficult because today, people are not stressed about their mortgage payments, and they've already locked in these mortgages.That's why you see that housing, existing home sale is so low because you can't sell your house today. But what if you had to? That becomes tricky.- So when you talk about the lower end consumer, presumably, that's also the consumer that is now more stretched in terms of taking out credit card debt, for example.RICK RIEDER: Definitely.- What you're describing in housing, that would be something potentially that would affect higher income consumers.RICK RIEDER: It would, but it's still-- yes, but I still think it's in the lower income strata that that becomes tricky. And if you go back to where you had real pressure on the economy, whether it's the financial crisis, it was driven to a large extent by pressure on the housing market. You go back to the savings and loan crisis, what's happened here and this is this dynamic of our interest rates, it's really hurt the commercial real estate market.Commercial real estate is not a big secular, big structural problem to the economy. It only-- we think it hits capital $30 to $40 billion total. It's not that big a deal. If you hit the housing market-- 3/4 of the wealth in the country is in people's homes. If you hit the housing market, that becomes a really tough thing.Heretofore, you haven't had that with mortgage rates escalating like they have because people just stopped selling and their employment dynamic is good. This is why we got to be really careful. I don't believe in the thesis, the way to get inflation durably lower, let's see if we can deteriorate the unemployment picture in the country. I just think it's wrong today, given different dynamics than we've seen versus historically.- Really interesting stuff, Rick. We've got to leave it there. Thank you so much for being here. Rick Rieder, BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer. Thanks as always. And thanks for coming in the studio. Good to see you in person. Love it.]"

Tech turbulence and high-interest rates combined to make high-yield stocks an alternative to riskier equities while still beating the yield on fixed-income investments like treasuries.Unfortunately, many investors chase the bottom-line yield stat without looking too closely into the underlying company. Dividend stocks are usually seen as mature, stable alternatives to high-flying growth stocks, so fundamentals go overlooked.

In fact, actual sales volume fell across the board for Altria.Overall sales fell 8.7%, and discount cigarette brand sales fell almost 25%. In a constrained economy, even nicotine fiends are considering quitting. The lower-price cigarette slump might be a leading indicator of reduced demand across the board.Altria’s 8.8% dividend yield is undeniably attractive to income investors. However, the company’s payout ratio is consistently close to 100% of earnings (currently 98.95%). Although dividends payouts come from cash flow — not earnings — Altria’s sales slump indicates that the current outlay isn’t sustainable.Edison International (EIX)Southern California Edison sign and logo EIX stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comStory continuesEdison International (NYSE:EIX) is one of the nation’s best-performing utility companies, primarily due to sustainable energy innovation and expansion. That growth plan sets it apart from comparable mature firms with limited innovation prospects. But Edison is still facing fallout from its $2.2 billion fire claims that may drag on future dividend payouts.The company’s August 7th earnings report referenced those liabilities. While the good news is that much of the cost is paid out, the company has yet to execute cost recovery. In all likelihood, that will come through price hikes passed to the customer. Although utility customers often have no say in metered pricing or a realistic alternative, there will likely be regulatory or government pressure to funnel cash toward cost recovery. That prospect could eat into dividend payouts.Edison’s current dividend yield is 4.21%. But, with a 117% payout ratio and looming uncertainty, the company’s future dividend prospects remain unclear.Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockThere’s an ongoing fight between employees and corporations over returning to the office, and Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) might suffer from the fallout. After the pandemic proved that remote roles are viable long-term, new remote and hybrid jobs continued climbing. That means less need for corporate office space as companies go fully remote or work out arrangements to share office space for hybrid work operations.Boston Properties, an office space owner and manager in key locations like New York, Boston, San Franciso and others, will lose the most if trends continue. The company’s real estate portfolio isn’t very diversified beyond these core office locations. In fact, BXP is facing the fallout already, as the occupancy rate dropped year-over-year, and management projects a fairly slim 88% rate for the remainder of 2023.Metropolitan office spaces are among the costliest to maintain as taxes, security and utilities are priced sky-high compared to residential or smaller-scale ventures. Those costs remain no matter the occupant rate. Therefore, as remote workers flee the big cities and leave buildings vacant, BXP’s expenses will continue accumulating without revenue to offset the staggering maintenance costs.BXP’s dividend yield is 6.14% right now, with a 92% payout ratio. But as cash starts flowing into maintaining unused properties, that yield may prove unsustainable.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint did not hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, it only increased shareholding by a small percentage, and it wasn't a huge purchase by absolute value, either. See our latest analysis for Westrock Coffee Company The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Westrock Coffee CompanyIn fact, the recent purchase by Co-Founder &amp; Chairman of the Board Joe Ford was not their only acquisition of Westrock Coffee Company shares this year. They previously made an even bigger purchase of US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$12.15 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$10.21. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.While Westrock Coffee Company insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeWestrock Coffee Company is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Westrock Coffee Company Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Westrock Coffee Company insiders own 19% of the company, currently worth about US$171m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Westrock Coffee Company Insider Transactions Indicate?The recent insider purchase is heartening. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Westrock Coffee Company. That's what I like to see! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Westrock Coffee Company (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.Of course Westrock Coffee Company may not be the best stock to buy.

It has recently witnessed a surge of 3.78%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of 30.07%. However, fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of Royal Caribbean Group.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with RCL. Click here to check it out. RCL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of RCLIs Royal Caribbean Group Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 8/105. Momentum rank: 6/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Royal Caribbean Group the GF Score of 66 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Snapshot of Royal Caribbean Group's BusinessRoyal Caribbean Group, with a market cap of $26.42 billion, is the world's second-largest cruise company. It operates 64 ships across five global and partner brands in the cruise vacation industry, with 10 more ships on order through 2026. The company's brands include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea. It also has a 50% investment in a joint venture that operates TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. The company's sales stand at $12.01 billion with an operating margin of 11.4%. However, the company completed the divestiture of its Azamara brand in the first quarter of 2021.Story continuesIs Royal Caribbean Group Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthFinancial Strength BreakdownRoyal Caribbean Group's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0.91 positions it worse than 85.38% of 554 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 0.69, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.04 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 6.25, which is worse than 95.11% of 654 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 7.29, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 75.31% of 563 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Royal Caribbean Group seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -12.7 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 71.48% of 768 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Royal Caribbean Group predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Is Royal Caribbean Group Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Royal Caribbean Group has a strong brand presence and a diverse portfolio, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns. Investors should tread carefully and consider these factors before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

One such stock that merits attention is Royal Caribbean Group (NYSE:RCL). The stock, which is currently priced at 100.18, recorded a gain of 0.83% in a day and a 3-month increase of 26.61%. The stock's fair valuation is $161.12, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with RCL. Click here to check it out. RCL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of RCLThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Is Royal Caribbean Group a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap? An In-Depth AnalysisHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Royal Caribbean Group should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.69, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Royal Caribbean Group a hidden gem or a value trap?Altman Z-Score: An Indicator of Financial HealthBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany Overview: Royal Caribbean GroupRoyal Caribbean is the world's second-largest cruise company, operating 64 ships across five global and partner brands in the cruise vacation industry, with 10 more ships on order through 2026. Brands the company operates include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea. The company also has a 50% investment in a joint venture that operates TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, allowing it to compete on the basis of innovation, quality of ships and service, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations, and price.Is Royal Caribbean Group a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap? An In-Depth AnalysisRoyal Caribbean Group's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Royal Caribbean Group's Altman Z-score reveals Royal Caribbean Group's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Royal Caribbean Group's historical data, 2021: 0.09; 2022: -0.04; 2023: -0.04, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Royal Caribbean Group's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Royal Caribbean Group, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 49.40; 2020: 37.74; 2021: 0.37; 2022: 18.37; 2023: 45.71; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-21.4%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Royal Caribbean Group's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is Royal Caribbean Group a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap? An In-Depth AnalysisThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Royal Caribbean Group's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.Conclusion: A Potential Value Trap?Given the indicators such as a low Altman Z-Score, declining revenues, and earnings, Royal Caribbean Group, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .

Read on to discover the financial health, profitability, and growth prospects of Ross Stores.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with ROST. Click here to check it out. ROST 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ROSTRoss Stores Inc (NASDAQ:ROST) is a leading American off-price apparel and home fashion retailer. It operates over 2,000 stores under the Ross Dress for Less and dd's Discounts banners. Ross Stores focuses on offering name-brand products at prices 20%-70% lower than conventional retailers. Its flexible merchandising approach and low-frills shopping environment centered on a treasure-hunt experience maximize inventory turnover and traffic, enabling its low-price approach.Ross Stores (ROST): A Fairly Valued Stock in the Retail IndustryUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. This value is calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates.According to the GF Value, Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) appears to be fairly valued. The stock's fair value is estimated based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. Currently priced at $120.83 per share, Ross Stores has a market cap of $41.20 billion and appears to be fairly valued.Story continuesRoss Stores (ROST): A Fairly Valued Stock in the Retail IndustryBecause Ross Stores is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth. For companies that may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk, check out these companies.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it is crucial to review the financial strength of a company before deciding to buy its stock. A good starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company is looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Ross Stores has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.79, which is better than 59.45% of 1085 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Ross Stores at 7 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Ross Stores (ROST): A Fairly Valued Stock in the Retail IndustryProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Ross Stores has been profitable 10 years over the past decade. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $19.20 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.72. Its operating margin is 10.52%, which ranks better than 79.14% of 1093 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Ross Stores at 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Ross Stores's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 59.54% of 1043 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry. However, Ross Stores's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0.7%, which ranks worse than 66.59% of 901 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry.ROIC vs WACCOne can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Ross Stores's ROIC is 21.55 while its WACC came in at 9.85.Ross Stores (ROST): A Fairly Valued Stock in the Retail IndustryConclusionOverall, Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) stock appears to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. However, its growth ranks worse than 66.59% of 901 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince?Story continuesVincent T. RocheThank you, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. ADI executed well in the third quarter and delivered results within our expectations despite the challenging operating environment. Revenue was nearly $3.1 billion, led by growth in our Industrial and Automotive markets once again. Gross margin remained strong, above 72%, operating margin was nearly 48% and EPS was $249 million. This continued profitability reflects our portfolio's resilience as well as the innovation premium that it commands. I want to turn to the current business environment now just for a moment. As we shared last quarter, we believe we're in a period of customer inventory reconciliation following 3 consecutive years of steady growth. Through our customer conversations, it's evident these accelerating inventory adjustments relate to the weakening macro backdrop and ADI's rapidly improving lead times. Importantly, we believe we shipped below end market consumption in the third quarter and expect to do so again in the fourth. This will help normalize our customers' inventory more quickly and position us to return to growth more quickly in the coming quarters.Stepping back, while near-term dynamics or turbulence, our long-term confidence remains undiminished. Over the last several decades, we have enhanced the resiliency of our global business, defined by our diversified customer and product portfolio and flexible hybrid manufacturing model. This enables us to ensure softer demand periods while sustaining strategic investments to ensure that we capitalize on the upside when the business inflects. It's these characteristics and our alignment to numerous concurrent secular growth trends that give us confidence that ADI will deliver on our long-term model of 7% to 10% revenue CAGR.Now one area underpinning this growth outlook are the applications tied to sustainable use cases, which currently represents about 1/3 of our total revenue. And today, I want to unpack a vital part of this, the evolving electrification ecosystem that is driving growth in our industrial and automotive markets. As the world marches to net 0, we need to eliminate 51 gigatons of global greenhouse gases emitted every year. Fossil fuels are by far the largest contributor accounting for more than 75% of all emissions. And at the same time, global energy consumption is forecasted to increase by 50% by 2050. A major unnecessary energy transition is underway and an upgraded and expanded energy grid is foundational to support a decarbonization pathway.Making the shift through renewable energy sources in both commercial and residential infrastructure as well as electric vehicles and global transportation will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These moves also create new challenges in the generation distribution, consumption and smoothing of energy supply. ADI solutions are embedded across all phases of this electrification journey from upgrading the grid infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. The common thread woven through all these applications is the high-performance precision signal processing, control and power management capabilities they require, capabilities in which ADI excels.Now today, I'll bring the story to life at the application level, starting with grid infrastructure. Overall, today's electrical grid is undergoing modernization to meet current and future demands. Historically, traditional energy sources like coal, oil and gas were centralized and distributed in one direction from the grid to the consumer.Today, renewable energy sources like wind and solar are more distributed necessitating a dynamic bidirectional flow of energy. To achieve this, the grid must be able to adjust performance across the network in real time, which requires an exponential increase in monitoring and storage capabilities. And for example, our collaboration with the Enel Group provides smart meters and grid digitalization solutions for distribution system operators.Here, ADI's control and sensing technologies are enabling high-performance, precision monitoring and data creation at the heart of the digital substation. And we're leveraging our mixed-signal digital and algorithm technologies to enable greater intelligence at the grid's edge.Now moving to energy storage systems, which are critical to mitigate intermittency issues across the network. ADI is a leader with our technologies used in 60% of energy storage systems across residential, commercial and grid scale networks. Leveraging our battery management system technology or BMS. We're increasing capacity and improving energy utilization in energy storage systems, which maximizes the battery's lifetime value. These monitoring and storage challenges extend to the grid's edge as well, including EV charging stations, ADI's energy metrology, isolation and sensing technologies, help enable a broader range of applications in AC and DC charging equipment.In addition to these important applications in our highly diverse industrial segment, our high-performance signal processing platforms and domain expertise are helping to electrify the automotive market. Here, our technology is a key enabler in the transition from combustion engines to cleaner electric vehicles by increasing range and lowering cost. And I'll start with BMS.As we've shared before, we are the leader in this area with our BMS solution designed into 16 of the top 20 EV manufacturers. We're currently sampling our eighth generation solution, which utilizes software and algorithms to enable physical measurement capabilities all the way into the battery cell. These advances in edge processing change the game in how the internal battery health is managed, supporting faster charging and better range prediction. An extension of this is our wireless BMS solution, a first in the industry. It has all the benefits of our wired solution and enables a scalable battery architecture, with quicker and more cost-effective production cycles.Currently, our wireless BMS is designed in at 4 OEMs, and we expect another large OEM to adopt it in the coming quarters. Given this momentum and the cutting-edge value proposition, we believe the wireless platform will represent a large portion of our BMS revenue by the end of the decade. And looking ahead, we're broadening our EV capabilities beyond battery management and storage to power conversion solutions. Specifically, we're developing a silicon carbide-based smart switch for bidirectional onboard charging that significantly reduces charger size and weight by over 50%, thus driving down cost. Notably, this intelligent integrated switch enables the EV to transfer energy back into the network, creating a more reliable grid. And this innovation solution more than doubles our content opportunity per EV powertrain.So in summary, ADI is driven by a deep sense of purpose and a desire for our innovations to positively impact all stakeholders. We're immensely proud of the role our technologies play to improve the well-being of humanity and indeed the planet, and I remain very confident in our future. Our portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, world-class talent base are aligned with an unprecedented number of attractive secular trends, where the semiconductor content per dollar of CapEx is increasing tremendously. This presents ADI with continued profitable growth opportunities as well as the ability to shape the future of industries.And so with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth.Prashanth Mahendra-RajahThank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. While demand continued to soften throughout the quarter, ADI delivered nearly $3.1 billion revenue, in line with our guidance. This was driven by continued year-over-year growth for both Industrial and Automotive.Looking at our performance by end market. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue, finished down 7% sequentially after a tremendous stretch of 13 straight quarters of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 4% with most applications up, led by sustainable energy as well as aerospace and defense, which each grew double digits. Automotive, which represented 24% of revenue, was down modestly sequentially in line with our expectations. Year-over-year growth of 15% was broad-based. We saw continued outsized growth for ADI's leading battery management and in-cabin connectivity solutions, which collectively increased nearly 30% year-over-year. Communications, which represented 12% of revenue, decreased double digits, both sequentially and year-over-year due to the broad-based inventory correction we flagged previously.And lastly, consumer, which represented 10% of revenue came in stronger than expected, finishing up 15% sequentially, but down 21% year-over-year. We remain optimistic that our second quarter marked the bottom for this business despite the ongoing inventory correction.And now on to the rest of the P&amp;L. Gross margin of 72.2% remains industry-leading, but declined sequentially due to lower utilization and product mix. Operating expenses of $752 million were roughly flat year-over-year and up sequentially. This quarter's OpEx reflects the full impact of annual merit increases. Operating margin of 47.8% contracted 230 basis points year-over-year, roughly in line with the gross margin decline. Non-op expenses were $57 million, and our tax rate was 11.2%. All told, EPS came in at $2.49 within our guidance range.Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. Given the revenue pressures and our decision to hold more finished goods versus restocking the channel, inventory dollars increased and the days of inventory moved higher to 179. As a result, channel inventory remains below our target level and slightly declined. Specifically, we strategically undershipped Asia, especially China, due to weaker demand trends. CapEx was $325 million for the quarter as we invest to enhance ADI's global resiliency and offer our customers options on where their products are sourced. 2023 should represent the high watermark for CapEx, and we expect it to decline in 2024.Importantly, our investments do not include the benefits of tax credit and grant funds that we anticipate from both the U.S. and the European Chips Act. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow or 29% of revenue. And over the same period, we've returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders or over 130% of free cash flow via more than $3.3 billion in buybacks and more than $1.6 billion in dividends.Now turning to the Q4 guidance. We expect the fourth quarter revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus or minus $100 million. This outlook assumes sell-in to be below sell-through. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect all markets to be down sequentially given the broad-based inventory correction. On a relative basis, Auto and Consumer should perform a bit better than Industrial and Comms.Operating margin is expected to be 44% plus or minus 70 basis points. This margin outlook embeds planned utilization reductions and a decline in OpEx. Our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2 plus or minus $0.10.As our outlook is lower than expected, let me provide some context on what we're experiencing and how we will navigate. Our revenue outlook reflects the broad-based macro softness across all end markets, all geographies and customers both large and small. We are also strategically improving lead times to get a better view into demand and enhance customer satisfaction. Today, we're shipping over 85% of our products within 13 weeks, and this is up from 35% a year ago. As Vince mentioned, we are seeing customers accelerate inventory adjustments due to both the softer environment and our lead time improvements. And as such, we're taking measures to preserve the integrity of our balance sheet, cash flow and income statement. This includes further reducing utilization and lowering external wafer purchases with a goal to decrease inventory meaningfully in the coming quarters.And importantly, as we've outlined before, we expect gross margins will maintain a 70% level on a trailing 12-month basis. This gross margin resiliency is a testament to the flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model and our unique swing capacity capability.In addition to the naturally lower variable comp, we're also taking steps to reduce total OpEx by roughly $50 million sequentially. So stepping back, we're not ready to call the bottom yet but our history shows that we cycle up quickly. And when we do, we will achieve higher highs. ADI has built a very resilient business, rich with opportunities. Our diversification and exposure to numerous secular trends drives our durable earnings stream and solid free cash flow, enabling us to consistently return capital to shareholders. And to that end, over the trailing 12 months, we've returned $5 billion to shareholders or more than 5% of our market cap.As this is my last ADI earnings call, I'd like to give a quick thank you to Vince for his mentorship and counsel over the past 6 years to the ADI Board, including our audit chair, Karen Golz, for their unwavering support and most importantly, to the world-class finance staff, including young Mike here for always reminding us of our commitments to you, the company's owners. I look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks as we get on the road. Mike, let's go to Q&amp;A.Michael C. LucarelliThanks, Prashanth. I don't think I've been called young in some time, but I appreciate that. Now let's get to our Q&amp;A session. We ask to limit yourself to 1 question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. You have a follow-up question, please requeue and we'll take your question if time allows. With that, can be our first question, please.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.Tore Egil SvanbergI have a question for Vince. So I know you're not ready to call a bottom. But some industry observers would say that this sort of inventory build started maybe late 2021, early 2022 based on your guidance for the October quarter, you're sort of back to that level. So then you've seen these cycles, you've seen many of them. They're all different. But just wanted to get a sense for you what you think we're getting close, especially given what I just said about that inventory adjustment now sort of being complete?Vincent T. RocheYes. Thanks, Tore. When I look at this current cycle, the symptoms are always the same in these cycles, but the causes tend to have different components. And I think right now, there are 2 kind of inputs to this particular correction. I think one is the inventory in digestion that exists out there that has been building for 18, 24 months now. And the second, of course, is the macroeconomic situation, which is a major governor as well. But I think if you look at what we understand from the direct side of our business, for example, when we look at our largest customers revenue growth and their forecast compared to our growth at these very same customers, we believe that we've been shipping the low-end consumption in the third and will in the fourth quarter.So I think one way to look at this is how long will the inventory correction take? My sense is it will be 2 to 3 quarters before we get through the inventory digestion cycle, and I think we're positioned as a company to get beyond it quite fast because we've been managing our factories very carefully, managing our inventories, both on our own balance sheet as well as our distribution channel. So we've also, I think, taken a long-term view to the demand patterns of our customers. We haven't, in any way, forced them into, for example, long-term supply agreements, essentially, at this point in the cycle, that will be forcing them to take products that they don't really need.We've been managing our channel aggressively. So as I said, we're keeping more inventory on our own balance sheet. So again, we will get to distribute the supply ultimately where we think it's needed when the recovery gets underway here. So that's my sense, sorry. I mean, in the industry, if you look back to the dot com cycle, you look at the 2008 financial crisis cycle, most of the downturns tended to last 3 to 4 quarters. So my sense is over the next 2, 3 quarters, we begin to see a recovery here, at least on the inventory side. And then it's really a question of how does the macro-economy perform?OperatorOur next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.Vivek AryaBest wishes again to Prashanth on his next adventure. You said that you're not ready to call the bottom yet and Vince, you mentioned that the inventory digestion period could last for some more time. How should we think about Q1 seasonality? It tends to be down kind of mid-single digit. Do you think we should be prepared for something different than that? right? And if it is worse than kind of mid-single digit, do you still think that ADI can maintain gross margins above 70%. So just kind of puts and takes to help us align our models would be very useful.Prashanth Mahendra-RajahWhy don't I take that, Vivek. So first, quick comments just to make sure everyone has the Q4 guide, correct. So on the channel, as I said in the prepared remarks, we are shipping in below the forecast we have from our channel partners. So we are intentionally bringing channel inventories down to help set us up for some better strength.The -- included in the guide is the backlog coverage has some turns, but less than normal given the higher level of uncertainty. So we would need some more turns and positive book-to-bill, which Vince mentioned is likely to be a quarter or 2 out. And then just from an end market standpoint, we've got all end markets down quarter-over-quarter.So as you know, we don't guide out further than the current quarter, but some color is I think you essentially have it right. There's no reason to think that first quarter would not be down seasonal on a, which would call it, mid-single digit quarter-over-quarter. But that we -- our view is going to be driven by the holidays and the customer decisions to reduce inventory as they go into the year-end.So we're not, at this point, seeing a more meaningful step down in Q1 based on what we can know today. And I will just remember to plant and everyone as you start to model out Q1 that every once in a couple of years, we have a 14-week quarter, and that will be Q1 of '24.And then on gross margins, I think we're actually quite proud of our gross margin story here that we've been -- we've messaged a number of times that we would have the ability to maintain a 70% gross margin in a -- on a trailing 12-month basis with a peak to trough decline of 15%. Q4 is down about 17% from the Q2 peak. And while we didn't give you a gross margin number, if you impute it from the OpEx math that I gave you, you'll see that we are able to hold that north of 70%, and we'll continue to work that. For Q1, gross margins, my best sense now would be that we are likely to face a little more challenge on the utilization level as we bring inventory levels down, but we have been very successful in activating our swing capacity.We're actually doing about 10% better on utilizations because we have swing than if we hadn't activated it. So it's been a very powerful lever for us. And and we need to see how the math on all of that works out for Q1, but I wouldn't expect Q1 to be notably different from kind of where we are for Q4.Vincent T. RocheYes. I'd like to add one other comment, Vivek, to what Prashanth has said. So the other side of margin is pricing, and pricing is very stable. It's very, very stable, resilient. I don't expect that to change. And our products are very, very sticky. We've got tremendous life cycles and that part of our business, this is really a unit correction in the business rather than price or share.OperatorOur next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.Ambrish SrivastavaThis is old Ambrish, Young Mike, can feel free to chime in. I was looking at the year-over-year comms, and I look at TI as your closest peer rival competitor. Vince, they started going into a year-over-year decline in 4Q '22 and you are just starting, and you said 2 to 3 quarters. So in the past history does suggest that usually on a year-over-year basis, we see roughly around 4 to 5 quarters of year decline. Is that the right way to think about your business? You said 2 to 3 quarters of digestion and I'm assuming that means year-over-year decline in reps, right?Vincent T. RocheYes. Good question, Ambrish. So yes, look, I mean, Comms is just a piece of ADI's overall story. We've actually seen -- I mean, we have 2 components as well. We've got wire line, we have wireless. I would say on the wire line side of things, we've seen the malaise going back into the late part of '22, early part of '23. So that's really things like optical control for data center and carrier networks, and power. We've got a power business there as well. So we think we'll see that, we expect to see CapEx somewhat recover in that space to be able to catch up with the needs, for example, driven by the explosion in computing power that's required to handle the AI inflection here, for example. So -- my sense is the wire line part will probably start its recovery in the first -- second quarter of the year.Wireless is a little harder to call. It's very, very dynamic. We all know that. The developed countries, particularly North America, 5G deployments, which have really been focused on coverage rather than capacity. They're going to be weaker than we thought. So that's probably going to give us headwinds for how long, we don't know, but I think it could be several quarters during our FY '24. India has been very strong this year, of course. And I think we're expecting to see more commitments to lay in both coverage and capacity in India during our FY '24.So look, we've got leadership in many of these areas, like optical control systems, 5G, software-defined solutions. It's really a question of timing in my mind. But -- there's a lot of uncertainty in the communications market in totality and particularly in wireless at this point. So hopefully, that gives you the answer to your question.Ambrish SrivastavaWell, I was asking about the overall business, Vince, not just about the Comms, sorry.Vincent T. RocheOkay. yes. Look, I think, Ambrish, the overall business. We see some trends, for example, that will transcend the inventory digestion problem. And even the macro-economy areas like digital healthcare, like aerospace and defense, the sustainable energy theme that we spoke to a little while ago. So again, I will just reiterate my sense is the inventory digestion problem will last probably 2, 3 quarters, and then we'll get back into a unit volume increase from there on.OperatorOur next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.Stacy Aaron RasgonPrashanth, I don't want to be pedantic on Q1, but I know you said right now, down seasonal, but also as an extra week. That extra week, if I just linearize it is like a plus 7. So do those cancel out? Or is it like it's the week between Christmas and New Year, so it's not a lot of revenue? Or just how do I think about the balance of those 2 things into Q1, assuming a Q1 that was...Prashanth Mahendra-RajahSo when I gave you my comments of down seasonal that was on a 13-week basis, the 14-week was just a reminder as you model it. So Mike, do you want to do the math, but I think you're essentially thinking about it right.Michael C. LucarelliYes. So as Prashanth said, let's take a first 13-week quarter. What happens normally in 1Q and a 13-week quarter our business is down, call it, 5%, plus or minus, total business. Now with an extra week, that adds about 7.5%, both on the revenue side and the OpEx side. So there's 2 pieces, normal, down 5% total company, in the 14-week quarter, you can add 7.5% of revenue and OpEx. That's the best way to think about it.Prashanth Mahendra-RajahAnd thank you for clarifying that, Stacy, I wasn't clear in my answer.Stacy Aaron RasgonOkay. And then that would drop off into Q2, though, you go the other way in Q2. So Q2 under like normal circumstances would be worse than seasonal because you have that extra week drop off?Michael C. LucarelliYes. So again, you can parse it in normal times, 2Q is up, call it, 2% to 5% and a 13-week to [13-week] quarter, if you take away an extra week, yes, you have a 7.5% headwind. They have got 1Q.Stacy Aaron RasgonGot it. Okay. That's helpful. I have another one, but I guess I don't want to get that band next time, so I....Michael C. LucarelliI'll allow another question because that's a good clarifying question, Stacy.Stacy Aaron RasgonOkay. I just wanted to ask about OpEx into next year. So it sounds like you're guiding it to about $700 million in the Q4. How do I think about it next year into a revenue year that's likely to be down potentially reasonably materially. Like how should we think about OpEx just year-over-year for fiscal '24 versus '23?Prashanth Mahendra-RajahYes. I think, Stacy, as we've always said, we run this business for the long term. So we're going to make the adjustments that are prudent to make on the discretionary side, adjusting the variable comp and where we can, but the value of this company comes from its innovation. So I wouldn't expect meaningfully more attack on the spending into 2024. But remember that our variable comp is designed to be highly accordion. So if '24 plays out as a down year, you will see that meaningfully unwind for us. Anything else...Stacy Aaron RasgonIs that $700 million runway Mike, is that like the right run rate to think about?Michael C. LucarelliThat's not a crazy level to think about for the year. I think if you take a step back and look at kind of what we're trying to manage within our control. We talked about gross margin maintaining at 70% a trailing 12-month basis. So for the full year, I think we can do 70% gross margins, and our goal is to maintain our operating margins within our long-term target and the low end of that account 42% to 45%. So that's kind of some guardrails we think about as you're modeling out next year and what would be a down year for revenue.OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.Christopher Brett DanelyCongrats Prashanth on retirement. I wish I was joining you. I just had a question on the Auto end market. So you're saying that you expect it to do, I guess, better relatively than Industrial. Given how much inventory has been built there, and the upcoming UAW strike, do you think it's possible that Auto could get materially worse? Are you baking that into any kind of forecast? And then are you I guess, Auto supply chain customers talking about a potential strike and the impact on their inventory.Prashanth Mahendra-RajahYes. All right. So thank you for the question. Chris, I think we're going to see you in a couple of weeks in New York. So on Auto, I guess some context first, we've grown for 12 consecutive quarters year-over-year. And including the fourth quarter, we're going to be up again. We said in the prepared comments that the lead times and the confidence supply is driving some of that acceleration in inventory adjustments and that's happening across all our markets. When we look specifically at Auto in the quarter and our growth rates there, the same strong growers, BMS, GMSL, A2B. They grew in the third quarter and both on a sequential basis and year-over-year. We expect kind of the similar strength from them into the fourth quarter.So I think that our outlook is, as Vince said, is really end market units driven and we have not yet put in a number nor have we received indicators from our supply chain partners that we should be making adjustments based on any disruption that could come from the negotiations that are going on right now.Vincent T. RocheYes. I think one other thing, Chris, to note is that, in general, there's more and more silicon value in cars every year, and that's true of ADI. We've got the switch to the electrification, which is, again, in pretty much the early stages of adoption. So there are some great growth drivers that will somewhat transcend the malaise, the economic malaise. But we still expect, overall, as Prashanth said, we've got many growth drivers that Automotive will continue to be the one of the better growth areas for ADI for the foreseeable future.OperatorOur next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.Harlan L. SurSorry about that. So in Q3, disti was down, was about 62% of sales. It was down about 4.5% sequentially. So that's less than the total business. Shipments to our direct customers came down around 8%. So maybe you guys can just discuss the shipments and excess inventory dynamics around both for Q3 and here in Q4. Is the excess inventory situation a little bit more pronounced than direct customers? And maybe similar to your disti customers where you have systems in place to monitor sell-through? Like how do you monitor the levels of sell-through and inventories at your direct customers?Prashanth Mahendra-RajahYes. Great. Okay. So let's do a couple of pieces on that. First, as a reminder, for a distribution company to do business with ADI, you have to give us your sell-through data on a weekly basis in arrears via electronic data feed. So we know exactly where our distribution guys are doing business, and we use that to run the company, as Vince always said, we run it on a POS basis. We said in the third sorry, in the second quarter earnings call, we said that we had gotten a little ahead of ourselves in China and that we intended to undership China. In the third quarter, we have done that. We are now intending to undership all markets generally in the fourth quarter to continue to bring the channel level inventories down. We have limited direct data visibility into our end customers inventory levels, except for those customers where we have consignment. But what we do have is the which you don't have access to is we can see the sales data of our products into our broad set of (inaudible) external customers and their corresponding revenue growth. And our team builds correlation data based on that to tell us how we're doing versus how their growth is. And that's what Vince was referring to that we have seen that their growth is accelerating versus our growth to them, which is why we have confidence that we are undershipping their end market demand, allowing them to pull inventory levels down, which, of course, it is safe to do so because now we can get our products to them within 13 weeks.Michael C. LucarelliYes. Prashanth that's a great point you made the less lead times is the best indicator of what our customers' inventory levels need to be. if a customer can get product quick, they need to hold a little less inventory. So our lead time is improving is helping us give us better visibility into what the customers need to hold and what they're holding.Vincent T. RocheYes. I think Prashanth said earlier, 85% of our total portfolio now is available in less than 13 weeks. Big, big change since this time last year.OperatorOur next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.Toshiya HariI had 2 quick ones, if I may. One on pricing. Vince, you mentioned that in the near term, it's more of a unit correction as opposed to a correction in pricing, which makes sense. To the extent foundry pricing improves into 2024, would you be in a position to share that sort of cost down, if you will, with customers the same way you've sort of passed on higher costs over the past couple of years? And then a second quick one for Prashanth. DOI 179, I think that's up, call it, 50, 60 days vis-a-vis pre-pandemic. How should we think about the new normal going forward? And how quickly can you get there?Vincent T. RocheSure. Let me answer the pricing piece first, Toshiya. There are really 2 parts to it. One is we have 75,000 product SKUs that are established and are the bedrock of the franchise of the ADI. They're very sticky. The product life cycles tend to be very, very strong. And they tend to be once they're designed and fairly price insensitive. And we're actually -- we're also, by the way, increasing the value of our products each year. We're managing the portfolio in terms of pricing. We're looking for elasticity, which is just a normal part of portfolio management. But -- we're also adding more value to the products that we're introducing to customers, the new products.I think the benefit of lower costs will come at the design-in phase if we do get lower cost, which from our third-party which, by the way, I think, is very, very unlikely. So I think the message is pricing is stable and very, very franchise is very durable.Prashanth Mahendra-RajahAnd I'll do the DOI one very quickly here, Toshi. So 179 days, balance sheet inventory grew call it, low single digits sequentially on a dollar basis. We have high confidence that we will exit Q1, taking out at least $100 million of inventory value. and the production plans are being oriented to allow us to do that. The days target, we have a model, but we've agreed that it is appropriate for the next CFO really to bless that model because they're going to own that and they need to kind of go through that map. So I can tell you that it's not going to be at 180 days, but I don't think we get back to 120 days. So we'll come back to you at some point on what that looks like.OperatorOur last question comes from Josh Buchalter with TD Cowen.Joshua Louis BuchalterAnd Prashanth, congratulations on the great run. You mentioned a few times under shipping in the print and the guidance. I was hoping you could maybe quantify the extent or maybe provide any sort of guidance to the amount that you're under shipping? And then given it sounds like seasonal fiscal first quarter isn't off the table. Does that mean we kind of expect you could be shipping to end demand exiting the October quarter?Prashanth Mahendra-RajahI'll let Mike take the second part of that question because I'm not sure I fully comprehended it. But on the first one, so we have our business that goes through the channel and the business that goes direct. Business through the channel, we have the demand forecast from our distribution guys, and we are under shipping into the channel to help them pull inventory levels in the channel down. We said that in the second quarter earnings call that we were going to do that for China. This quarter, we're going to do it across the globe for all distis.Your second question on how to think about the under shipment into end demand that Vince referenced to. All I can really do is refer back to sort of the data analysis that we do. There's not a real way to aggregate that, except to say that we have a relatively good correlation between our end customers revenue growth and our growth to those end customers on an individual basis and when we look at how they grew in third quarter versus our shipments to them and how they're forecasting or you guys or consensus forecasting their fourth quarter growth versus our shipments to them, we know that we're going to be helping them to pull inventory levels down, which again makes tremendous sense because lead times have improved. And Mike, I didn't...Michael C. LucarelliSure. on the first -- it's good question. If you look at the first quarter, we always typically undership consumption in the first quarter, why? You see a lot of our customers reduce their working capital going into end of the year-end. So the down 5% in our -- seeing the seasonal first quarter is below consumption. I think after that, you get back to kind of what Vince was saying you get coming back to demand and consumption, all kind of imbalance. And then it comes to a question of macro, what's happening in macro in our second quarter. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We once again will be on the road a lot this quarter. You'll find us in New York, Chicago, Florida, London and San Fran. Reach out to IR team to be notified when we are in your ZIP code. And with that, thanks for joining us and the interest in ADI.OperatorThis concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

If you want to skip our primer on Mr. Buffett and insider trading, then jump ahead to Warren Buffett and Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks.The second quarter of 2023 has proven to be an interesting one when it comes to Warren Buffett. As his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway filed its holdings for the period with the SEC, it revealed that Mr. Buffett had shaken things up by quite a bit. During the second quarter, he reduced his investments significantly in five companies and took up new stakes in three new firms. The unfortunate firms in this list are Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). These firms saw Berkshire Hathaway reduce its investments by 71%, 61%, 45%, 40%, and 8%, respectively. Cumulatively, the reduction translated into the investment firm cutting down the stakes by roughly $6.5 billion.The new investments came in some of the biggest home building companies in America, indicating that Mr. Buffett is on board with the significant improvement in sentiment surrounding the industry this year. Home building companies are facing some interesting times since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic, which led to stay at home orders and lock downs, resulted in a large scale shift to remote working. This not only freed up office space but also increased demand for houses in suburban areas as more workers moved to the city outskirts and felt encouraged by low interest rates to buy a house. This sudden surge in demand enabled the home building companies to massively increase their margins - a strategy that benefited them in 2023. The main hurdle for home buyers this year is high interest rates, but big home builders have successfully navigated against this by reducing their margins and offering buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. Naturally, home builder stocks have soared on the market this year, and Mr. Buffett's three new investments in this category are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).Story continuesWarren Buffett's latest SEC filings show that he has invested approximately $814 million in the three home building companies and increased his investment in the financial services firm Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by $409 million. Cumulatively, this shows that he bought $1.2 billion worth of shares of four companies in Q2 2023, which is quite a bit of activity when we consider the stability of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio. This stability comes through the Oracle of Omaha's investment strategy which sees him bide his time and wait patiently before pouncing and plowing billions of dollars into the stock of companies that he deems to be suitable. For more details on Warren Buffett's investment strategy, be sure to check out Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks which is a list that includes some stocks that he has held for decades after promising that he will never sell them.Shifting gears to focus on insider trading, along with penny stock pump and dump scandals, it is one area of the stock market that has generated controversy for decades and will continue to do so. This is evident from the fact that on June 29th, 2023 alone, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI filed insider trading charges against ten people in four separate cases. According to the U.S. Attorney, the accused made more than $30 million through 'stolen' and material non public information. The latest insider trading scandals in America include one of the largest companies in the world, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). A Pfizer employee Amit Dagar knew in 2021 that the firm's Paxlovid had generated positive results in a trial for COVID treatment, and he and his associates bought and sold call options to make more than $350,000 in profits.Today, we'll look at some stocks that are favored by both Warren Buffett and insiders to see which lucky companies have seen not only the most successful investor of our time buy their shares, but also confidence from their board and investors to solicit stock purchases. Some notable names on this list are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP).Warren Buffett and Insiders Love These StocksOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the stocks that both insiders and Warren Buffett are buying, we scanned Berkshire Hathaway's second quarter of 2023 investment portfolio and checked each of the 46 company stocks in it with Insider Monkey's insider trading tracker to see which firms have seen insider purchases.

Marriott InternationalMarriott International has entered into a partnership with HDFC Bank in India to introduce the country’s inaugural co-branded hotel credit card.With a presence of 145 hotels across 16 distinct brands situated in 41 cities within India, Marriott stands as the largest hospitality entity in the nation, boasting the highest inventory of rooms.At the core of Marriott’s strategy lies Marriott Bonvoy, the hospitality behemoth’s loyalty program that garners a remarkable 186 million members globally.Talking to Skift at the launch on Thursday, Ranju Alex, the area vice president for South Asia at Marriott, said there are over 4.5 million Bonvoy members in India. The introduction of the co-branded credit card is anticipated to further add to this membership count.Alex affirmed, “Loyalty stands as our paramount driving force for attracting guests to our hotels. We strive to continually foster engagement with them, ensuring their loyalty within an intensely competitive landscape.”The credit card aims to leverage the aspirations of the emerging middle class within the nation, Alex remarked.Marriott Cards in AsiaMarking the fourth Asian destination for this initiative, India joins the ranks of countries where Marriott has launched co-branded credit cards.Prior to this, the company unveiled two cards in Korea, two in Japan, and three in China.The discussions regarding the co-branded credit card had commenced prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The launch was unavoidably postponed due to the pandemic’s disruptions. Had circumstances been different, the launch would likely have taken place in early 2022, according to Alex.John Toomey, the chief sales and marketing officer for Asia Pacific (excluding China) at Marriott International, shed light on the extended timeline of research that led to this collaboration. “The research on this probably started five to ten years ago,” he said to Skift.Toomey added it would take someone living under a rock to ignore India’s potential as a hub for tourism and hospitality. This applies not only to outbound travel but also to the flourishing domestic landscape.Story continuesIndians and Credit CardsIn reference to the credit card habits of Indians, Toomey observed, “Moreover, this demographic displays a pronounced inclination towards credit card usage. In contrast, certain other nations, like Indonesia with its substantial population of 300 million, maintain a relatively subdued enthusiasm for credit cards.”An average Indian credit card user holds at least two credit cards, according to credit advisory Credit Sudhaar. And chances are at least one of them is a co-branded card issued by the bank in partnership with a leading retail company.HDFC Bank has reported exponential growth in its co-branded new acquisition portfolio, as it notes a threefold increase year-on-year with a total of over 3 million cards issued.Regulations from the Reserve Bank of India grant only banks the authority to issue credit and debit cards in India, which means retail enterprises must collaborate with financial institutions to introduce co-branded cardsThe Marriott-HDFC credit card will run on Diners Club, part of the Discover Global Network.Lately, there has been a jump in the number of co-branded credit card launches in the country.Indian full-service carrier Vistara last month launched its third co-branded credit with IDFC FIRST Bank.A Collinson report recently stated that Indian consumers are willing to use their payment cards for travel expenses and everyday costs when travel-related rewards are offered.Marriott’s Focus on LoyaltyExecutives at Marriott have often emphasized the mutually beneficial relationship between the loyalty program and co-branded credit cards. An earlier Skift story had mentioned how by leveraging the loyalty of their members and encouraging direct bookings, Marriott aims to bypass intermediary fees from online travel agencies.Bart Buiring, chief sales and marketing officer for Asia Pacific at Marriott International, in an earlier interaction with Skift, underscored the centrality of the Marriott Bonvoy program in their consumer strategy. With over 55 million members in the Asia Pacific alone, Marriott hopes to inspire renewed enthusiasm for travel within its customer base.The success of the Bonvoy program has also translated into substantial revenue from fees associated with their co-branded credit cards. These cards achieved record acquisition rates and card spending in the previous year. Marriott revealed a remarkable 16 percent year-over-year increase in non-room-related franchise fees, largely attributed to their co-brand credit card fees.Additionally, a recent analysis by CBRE Hotels Research highlighted that Marriott, along with other major hospitality players including Hilton, Hyatt, Wyndham, and Choice, collectively witnessed a 35 percent average growth in loyalty members since 2019.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

(MAR) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-international-inc-mar-attracting-130011335.html,1692795611,STORY,['MAR'],"[Marriott International (MAR) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this hotel company have returned +4.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.1% change. The Zacks Hotels and Motels industry, to which Marriott belongs, has gained 0.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marriott is expected to post earnings of $2.09 per share, indicating a change of +23.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29.5%. This estimate has changed +2.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.53 indicates a change of +10.1% from what Marriott is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marriott is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Marriott, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.86 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.93 billion and $25.31 billion estimates indicate +15.2% and +5.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarriott reported revenues of $6.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.8%. EPS of $2.26 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.46%. The EPS surprise was +3.2%.Over the last four quarters, Marriott surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marriott is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marriott. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Americans who have been shopping for a home in 2023, despite limited inventory and high mortgage rates that remain in the 6-7% range, are flocking to areas that are more affordable relative to the rest of the country, less expensive than their nearby metro area, or provide better value, offering more space at a lower price.Located exclusively in the Midwest and the Northeast, each of this year's top 10 Hottest ZIP codes in America is attracting buyers with homes that are either priced at or below the U.S. median, or are larger in size than the U.S. average. Additionally, homes listed within the Hottest ZIPs received an average of 3.6 more views per listing than in the rest of the country, and sold one month faster than average in 2023.The 2023 Hottest ZIP Codes in America, in rank order, are:43230, Gahanna, Ohio06489, Southington, Conn.07450, Ridgewood, N.J.01810, Andover, Mass.18064, Nazareth, Pa.46322, Highland, Ind.48183, Trenton, Mich.06851, Norwalk, Conn.14534, Pittsford, N.Y.63021, Ballwin, Mo.""As many companies continue to call employees back to the office, we're seeing a surge in home shoppers who are seeking a desirable combination of cost and convenience within commuting distance of major metropolitan areas,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""In addition to affordable markets, this year's list also features some higher priced areas close to large urban cores, which will likely appeal to buyers who are concerned with finding the right mix of size and amenities within reach of a nearby city center.""Story continuesNo. 1 Hottest ZIP: Gahanna, Ohio This year's Hottest ZIP Code is Gahanna, Ohio (43230), which continues the legacy of Columbus, Ohio markets appearing on the Hottest ZIP codes list. The greater Columbus area offers home buyers the amenities and quality-of-life advantages of a larger town, but at a lower price. It's home to The Ohio State University, the Short North Arts District as well as a captivating food scene. Homes in this ZIP code were priced 12.7% below the national median in June – and with more than a quarter of its population aged 25-34, it's favorable for young renters and buyers alike.Suburban space, closer commutes draw home shoppersLooking more closely at this year's hottest ZIPs, No. 3 on the list, Ridgewood, N.J. (07450), is a high-priced suburb of New York City that offers an idyllic setting with typical listings that are more than double the size of those in the NYC metro and is just a one-hour commute from Manhattan. Shoppers are willing to pay up for these amenities, and homes in the area have  a price-per-square-foot that is 7.9% higher than the metro's average. Residents of this year's No. 4 ZIP on the list, Andover, Mass. (01810), a suburb of Boston, can commute to the city in under an hour, and the area also boasts larger homes priced 25% lower per square foot than Boston listings. The typical home in No. 9, Pittsford, N.Y. (14534), was 29.3% larger than the median-sized home in the surrounding Rochester metro, less than 30 minutes from the city center by car, and despite the premium to live in this desirable village, listing viewership was more than 30% higher than the surrounding metro. Finally, Ballwin, Mo. (63021), at No. 10 on the list, is similar to these Northeast locales in that listing prices in the area tend to be higher than the metro average, but homes for sale were upwards of 30% larger than the metro's median home size.Big-city dwellers are driving demand Six of this year's Hottest ZIP codes – generally those found near big-cities – drew the majority of their property views from within their metro area, suggesting that in many areas, buyers are looking to move around locally. Additionally, those areas seeing significant interest from other locations are typically seeing it come from big-city shoppers. Reflecting this trend, No. 1 ranked Gahanna, Ohio (43230) captured the largest share of out-of-metro viewership among the Midwest metros, drawing 13.1% of its viewership from the New York City area in the second quarter of 2023. In fact, New York City was the top out-of-market viewer for seven of the 10 hottest zips.Size matters: nearly all Hottest ZIPs feature more spaceIn seven out of 10 of this year's Hottest ZIP codes, the typical home is larger than the average home in the surrounding metro area. Among the more expensive locations on the list, the typical household size is also larger, indicating that home shoppers in places such as Ridgewood, N.J. (07450), Andover, Mass. (01810) and Pittsford, N.Y. (14534) may be shopping for more space to accommodate a larger family. This is particularly true in Ridgewood, N.J. (07450), the most expensive ZIP on this year's list, where the typical household is 19.7% larger than the U.S. average of two-and-a-half people per household.Homebuyers want affordability Recent near-record high mortgage rates and still-inflated listing prices continue to create affordability challenges for homebuyers, resulting in buyer demand in areas that boast affordability. Seven of the top 10 Hottest ZIP codes offer home prices that are similar or lower than the U.S. median listing price or the prices in their surrounding metropolitan area. Notably, the Midwest saw a post-pandemic boom, as traditionally popular metros became unaffordable and many home buyers looked for value in new locations. Four major Midwest markets on this year's list are close to city centers, including Columbus, Ohio (43230 No. 1 Gahanna), Chicago, Ill. (46322 No. 6 Highland, Indiana), Detroit, Mich. (48183 No. 7 Trenton, Michigan) and St. Louis, Mo. (63021 No. 10 Ballwin, Missouri). These markets offer homebuyers prices that are 24.7% lower than the U.S. median, as well as a strong local economy and employment rates below the national average.From hot to not: West, South left outOnly the Northeast and Midwest are represented in this year's ranking, the first time in the list's history that only two regions are included. The South and West regions are not represented among this year's rankings, leaving out regions of the country that have typically contributed several markets to the list. Back in 2017 the South and West accounted for more than half of the Hottest ZIPs, and in both 2018 and 2019, these regions accounted for at least half of the top 10. High prices in the West and high price growth during the pandemic in the South are likely contributing to the shift.Among the top 10, buyers need to be prepared and move fastDespite the overall housing market starting to cool, with the average home in the U.S. spending about 45 days on the market, homes in this year's Hottest ZIP codes spent just 10 to 25 days on the market and saw three times more visitors per property on Realtor.com® in June. With inventory falling 22.4% in these ZIP codes compared to a 7.1% increase nationally, those looking to buy in these markets are facing tough competition.""Shoppers in this year's Hottest ZIP codes should cope by being prepared – pre-approved and zeroed in on their budget and down payment – and really focused on must haves versus nice-to-haves so they can be ready to act quickly when they see the right home hit the market,"" said Realtor.com® Economic Research Analyst Hannah Jones. The high price of financing a home purchase this year and still-steep competition meant successful buyers in the hottest markets also came with exceptional qualifications, with an average credit score of 754, surpassing the U.S. average of 740.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 89% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week’s 4.3% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. One-year return to shareholders is currently 38% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of KLA. See our latest analysis for KLA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About KLA?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that KLA does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see KLA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. KLA is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.0% and 4.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of KLAThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of KLA Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$103m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over KLA. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

285,210f6241-c667-365e-ae16-5f9ae5e39ee1,VZ,2023-08-24,15 Countries That Own the Most U.S. Debt,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-own-most-u-222257907.html,1692829377,STORY,"['T', 'VZ']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 countries that own the most U.S. debt. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that own the most U.S. debt.The U.S. has, for many years, had the highest debt in the world by a long distance. While traditionally, debt has been considered to be a negative indicator, and while this stigma is still present in many countries and cultures around the world, global thinking has changed in this regard and debt has been considered not just relevant but often necessary for growth. This is why some of the biggest companies in the world have increased their debt profile, though generally, companies operating in more capital-intensive industries are often highly leveraged.On the other hand, if countries or companies continue to increase their debt and become highly leveraged, then they are susceptible to changes in interest rates, which is why the interest coverage ratio is an important indicator of assessing a company's potential to be able to repay its debt, and a company where the interest coverage ratio is less than 2 is often considered to be a risky proposition for investment, though this can also vary industry by industry and even company by company depending on other variables. Similarly, if a country's external debt is really high, then rising interest rates simply result in the debt continuing to increase and while the U.S. is the biggest economy in the world and can pay its rising debt, the countries that own the most U.S. debt will receive much higher interest payments and even the U.S. might have to divert cashflow from other activities to be able to meet its interest payments. Currently, the U.S. is also at the top of the countries with the highest debt to GDP ratios in the world.15 Countries That Own the Most U.S. DebtThis is exactly the situation that is playing out right now, as interest rates across the world have continued to increase while governments bid to control rampant inflation, which has resulted in higher interest payments and according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, this could impact the U.S.'s fiscal outlook, with a report by the Congressional Budget Office indicating that if changes aren't made, then public debt could jump from 98% of total GDP in 2023 to 181% in 2053, with the hike in interest rates contributing significantly to this increase.Story continuesOf course, while rising interest rates are continuing to benefit the countries that own the most U.S. debt, highly leveraged companies are suffering greatly because of the reasons discussed earlier. One such impacted group is office REITs, which have been greatly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and many companies focusing on hybrids ways of working rather than demanding staff to return to office full time. The median office occupancy rate has fallen to just 87%, the lowest rate seen since office occupancy started to decline amidst the pandemic. While REITs have historically outperformed other asset classes such as stocks and bonds based from 1992 to 2017, the situation has changed in 2023. While occupancy rates have dwindled, highly leveraged REITs have seen their cashflows and net profits impacted by higher interest rate payments. Property values tend to decline as well when interest rates are higher. This is true globally and not just in the U.S. with UK Office REITs declining 23% YTD on average, and in the last one year, have seen their share prices fall by 31.6%. Similarly, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:ARE), one of the biggest REIT companies in the world, has seen their average share price fall by nearly 20% YTD alone. Multiple defaults have already occurred in the U.S. real estate sector in 2023 because of rising interest rates and you can learn more by visiting the worst performing REITs in 2023. At the same time, as interest rate hikes are seemingly softening and inflation doesn't seem out of control as it was in 2022, this could mean that stocks such as Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:ARE) are undervalued and might prove to be good investments, especially since many companies are calling for employees to return to office to some extent.Similarly, companies in various sectors are also quite sensitive to interest rate hikes, as higher rates increase their liabilities relative to assets, and put pressure on their PE ratios. Telecom companies often can carry large amounts of debt as the business is capital intensive in order to develop the necessary infrastructure required, and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), one of the most valuable telecom companies in the world, is the most indebted company in the world, while Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) also makes the top five. Being highly leveraged means that these telecom companies have to account for higher interest payments when interest rates rise, impacting profitability and has contributed to AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) seeing its share price fall by 24.8% YTD while Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has seen its stock price fall by nearly 18% in the same time period. At the same time, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) has worked on reducing its debt and mentioned this in its Q2 2023 earnings call ""Over the past three years, we've reduced our net debt by about $20 billion. We also recently transferred $8 billion of pension liabilities through the purchase of insurance annuities. As Pascal will discuss, we've addressed the number of one-time and discrete items and now expect to use an increasing amount of our free cash flows after dividends to accelerate our debt reduction efforts. We remain committed to achieving the 2.5 times range for net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2025."" On the other hand, many companies also engage in interest rate swaps to hedge against the risk of interest rates rising.MethodologyTo determine the countries that own the most U.S. debt, we visited the U.S. Treasury government website, which has data on U.S. treasury securities being held by countries, with the total debt held by foreign countries amounting to $7.4 trillion, and ranked nations based on how much debt they hold. All securities holdings are as at Jan 2023.15. FranceTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $183.9France's history on giving loans to the U.S. can be traced back several centuries to the American Revolution, when a cash-strapped U.S. took loans from France. That relationship has continued to the present day even though France's U.S. debt ownership has fallen by $50 billion in the past year.14. SingaporeTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $187.6Like many nations among the list of countries that own the most U.S. debt, Singapore is a major financial center with many companies operating regional headquarters in the country. The holdings of these countries are considered part of Singapore's ownership of U.S. debt, which helps explain why such a small country owns so much U.S. debt.13. BrazilTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $214.0Brazil owns the highest U.S. debt in Latin America, mainly because of the security investing in a stable currency offers.12. Hong KongTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $226.8Hong Kong was one of several countries nervously following the U.S. debt impasse, and must have breathed a sigh of relief when it was resolved towards the end of May 2023, with one of the primary reasons for purchasing U.S. debt being an attempt to maintain its currency peg to the U.S.11. IndiaTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $232.0Surprisingly, India is among the countries which own the most U.S. debt and has increased its holdings over the past year by 16%.10. TaiwanTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $234.6According to the Financial Times, in 2019, Taiwan owned around 14% of the U.S. long-term corporate bonds, and Taiwanese insurers have significantly increased their holdings of U.S. mortgage-backed securities.9. IrelandTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $253.4Ireland has become a tax haven for many U.S. companies, which you can learn more about by visiting the 10 biggest Irish companies. Since these companies mostly have operations in the U.S., they hold large amounts of government securities which is counted in Ireland's total.8. CanadaTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $254.1Canada has increased its U.S. debt ownership from $217 billion in January 2022 to $254 billion in January 2023.7. Cayman IslandsTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $285.3The main reason why Cayman Islands hold so much U.S. debt is because of the fact that many major hedge funds are domiciled there, and their international deposits count towards this total. In fact, a various reports suggest that more than half of global hedge funds are domiciled there.6. SwitzerlandTotal holdings of U.S. treasury securities (in billions): $290.5Switzerland has one of the lowest debt to GDP ratios of developed countries in the world, and has a significant investment in U.S. debt. Separately, U.S. bondholders are preparing to sue Credit Suisse, after the bank declared bankruptcy and was taken over by its rival UBS.Click to continue reading and see the 5 countries that own the most U.S. debt.Suggested Articles:20 Most Dangerous Countries in Europe11 Most Undervalued Biotech Stocks to Buy According to Analysts20 Countries That Watch the Most TVDisclosure: None. 15 countries that own the most U.S. debt is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

There she learned to use cutting-edge technology such as 360-degree cameras and virtual reality (VR) apps. What Grace might not have expected, however, was how soon she'd put her new knowledge of digital tech to professional use - creating a promotional VR video for the college.Grace's mom, Jennie Lester, is an administrative assistant for Big Sandy's Lineman Training program, which prepares workers for jobs in the utility line industry. While Jennie was brainstorming ways to advertise the program, Grace piped up with a thought: Why not create a VR video, using those same 360-degree cameras she had access to during the Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers program? They could attach a camera to a lineman's helmet and film him climbing a utility pole.Jennie loved the idea. ""I'm proud of her for stepping out of her shell, for having the confidence to do this,"" she says of her daughter.With the footage from the camera-mounted helmet in hand, Grace developed her video. ""I stitched it together to create a VR experience of what it's like to be a lineman,"" she explains.Grace's innovative idea and practical application of next-gen technology is what the STEM-focused summer program is all about. ""Grace is a prime example of how we're trying to empower students with Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers,"" says Jarred Gibson, program director at Big Sandy. In this area of eastern Kentucky, he notes, the poverty level is high and resources are limited. ""[The program] gives kids an opportunity to be somewhere in the summer, to get a warm meal every day, or breakfast, while learning curriculum and STEM,"" says Gibson. ""We provide equipment that they would probably never get to touch otherwise.""Story continuesThat equipment and training includes VR, AR, 3D printing, robotics, coding and entrepreneurship. With a curriculum designed by Arizona State University, students learn how to use this technology with an entrepreneurial mindset.For Grace, who is about to start her freshman year of high school, the impact of the program went beyond even the production of the video. When she arrived, she was shy and reserved. ""The program really gave me a good opportunity to … expand and make new friends and … become a little more confident,"" Grace says.

The 2023 PSR white paper coincides with the approaching compliance deadline of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) version 4.0. This update to the current PCI DSS is the largest change since 2004. These updates will affect all organizations that store, process or transmit cardholder data, from e-commerce to the public sector.Compliance with PCI DSS v4.0 is strongly encouraged by March 31, 2024 as v3.2.1 will expire. The standard has numerous updates and 64 new requirements. As organizations navigate this new standard, the 2023 PSR provides the tools to address critical areas in security management program design to not only meet the deadline but also set an organization up for long term success. This includes the role of PCI security integration into larger corporate governance, risk management, and compliance initiatives as well as the tools needed for modern program design.“Compliance is often seen as an added complexity to an already challenging task of securing digital payments in the face of evolving threat actor capabilities,” said Kris Philipsen, Managing Director of Cybersecurity Consulting at Verizon. “Fortunately, highly effective methods to achieving payment security compliance exist and are outlined in the Verizon Payment Security Report not only help make PCI DSS v4.0 outcomes highly predictable, but moreover allow organizations to achieve breakthrough performance enhancements in security program design.”The 2023 PSR helps to guide organizational leaders through designing and managing a PCI security compliance program, offering adaptable models for organizations to use. The report also notes leading management methods for identifying and overcoming the most significant constraints, providing a process for clarifying root causes of poor security program performance.Story continues“The March 2024 retirement date for PCI DSS v3.2.1 is rapidly approaching,” says Lance Johnson, Executive Director of PCI SSC. “The PCI Security Standards Council is committed to helping organizations understand the latest version of PCI DSS. To do this, the Council has created a PCI DSS v4.0 Resource Hub, which houses resources to help organizations better understand the Standard. By understanding what PCI DSS v4.0 means for your organization, you can take the necessary steps to achieve a smooth and efficient transition.”The top five insights businesses need to know:As PCI DSS requirements evolve, so should security programs.Data security and compliance success is achieved by design – not by luck.Leading management methods simplify program management complexity, helping organizations to be economic and achieve more with less.Organizations should design security programs to focus on what matters most and overcome the most important constraints.An integrated program management design can be applied to new programs and vastly improve existing programs.Read the 2023 Verizon PSR insights white paper, and learn more about the best practices for organizations to implement the PCI DSS v4.0.About the Verizon Business 2022 Payment Security ReportVerizon published the industry’s first analysis on the global state of compliance of PCI DSS in the 2010 Verizon PCI Compliance Report, now called the Payment Security Report (PSR). Based on global data gathered by qualified security assessors (QSAs) from Verizon and other external contributors, with additional comparisons between geographic regions (Americas, EMEA and APAC), the report explores why some companies accomplish more than others in their efforts to achieve sustainable and effective data security. Since its inception, the PSR has tracked compliance ups and downs, while keeping a finger on the pulse of the changing payment security landscape.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $136.8 billion in 2022.

290,08bd25bc-993c-355b-b4e9-2c608bef02e8,TPR,2023-08-24,We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) Passed With Ease,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ran-stock-scan-earnings-growth-165900612.html,1692809940,STORY,['TPR'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Tapestry (NYSE:TPR). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Tapestry Tapestry's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Tapestry's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Tapestry's EPS skyrocketed from US$3.24 to US$4.12, in just one year; a result that's bound to bring a smile to shareholders. That's a impressive gain of 27%.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Tapestry reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. That's not bad, but it doesn't point to ongoing future growth, either.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Tapestry's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Tapestry Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Tapestry has a market capitalisation of US$7.5b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$28m. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. While their ownership only accounts for 0.4%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Is Tapestry Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Tapestry's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Tapestry's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. Even so, be aware that  Tapestry is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

301,27ded5cd-ce35-36d0-aa17-09ce1f2de4ef,FOX,2023-08-24,Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-corporation-nasdaq-foxa-goes-100331838.html,1692871411,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Fox's shares on or after the 29th of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 27th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.26 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.52 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Fox has a trailing yield of 1.6% on the current share price of $32.94. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Fox's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Fox If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fox paid out just 21% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 21% of its cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Fox's earnings per share have dropped 6.4% a year over the past five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Fox has delivered 3.1% dividend growth per year on average over the past four years.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Fox for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share are down meaningfully, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend needs to be cut. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.While it's tempting to invest in Fox for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Fox and you should be aware of it before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

The offer included wage increases and AI protections, but the deal was denied by the WGA. Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down what else the offer entailed.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Hollywood studios is releasing the details of their latest offer to screenwriters in a bid to end the ongoing strike. The new offer, well, it includes higher pay and protections against AI. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the latest details for us. Allie, are we getting any closer to a deal?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, it's an interesting tactic by the studios to release this proposal publicly. They're doing this to put some pressure on the Guild, which actually denied the proposal in a meeting late last night. The two sides meeting face to face for the first time in a long time.We had some pretty prominent executives there like Disney CEO Bob Iger, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, WBD CEO David Zaslav. But the Guild slammed the meet up in a follow-up email to members saying, quote, ""This wasn't a meeting to make a deal. This was a meeting to get us to cave.So some pretty fighting words there. They essentially said that this deal didn't even come close to addressing all of their concerns. They still want a mandatory number of writers to be staffed on every shown in addition to bonuses based on how popular a show is on a streaming service. But this is-- what you're seeing on your screen now is what the studios did offer.And from their perspective, they believe that they really hit all the main points that the writers were asking for. We see a higher compensation, increases to streaming residuals, further protections around AI, a guaranteed minimum length of employment, and more transparency around viewership data so writers can actually understand the popularity of their work.And just to get even more specific here, the studios said the proposed wage increase would be a compounded 13% jump over the three-year contract. And that would actually be the highest increase for the WGA in 13 years. And then on the streaming residual side, that would jump by 22%.Story continuesSo they think they came up with a fair deal. Writers say no. It's a lose-lose situation. That's what I'm hearing from analysts right now. I mean, writers are out of work. You know, they have livelihoods that are just on hold right now. And then on the studio side, they're strapped for cash.They're bleeding money. Streaming profitability is still a major issue. And we're going to eventually hit a point where we're going to run out of content. So at some point, some people are even predicting in 2024. So it could go on for that long.- Wow, that would be long.ALEXANDRA CANAL: The pain on both sides is just going to be too much. So it's just how long can both sides hold out here?- That's a good question. And apparently, the writers are also asking for a cut of the rewards when it comes to revenue. Could this be a sticking point, especially as analysts predict Netflix is about to have a huge cash injection?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I mean, Netflix is doing really well with some of their revenue initiatives like the crackdown on password sharing, the ad-supported tier. I do think that's going to be a sticking point. They want a cut. If a show is doing really well on a streaming service. And bringing in subscribers, the writers are saying they deserve some-- a piece, at least, of that pie.But again, the streamers are really hesitant to set a precedent here, the studios are, because if they sign something, if they commit to giving a cut to the writers and then they're not able to make money in the end, that's going to be an issue. So it's not just coming up with a contract for today. It's thinking about where the industry is going to be in the next 5, 10 years.I mean, the last writers strike in 2007, no one would have ever predicted the explosion of streaming that we're seeing today. So it's a really challenging environment to try and think of a deal and come up with a way that both sides can sort of reach this compromise. But clearly, the writers right now believe that they have the upper hand.- And it sounds like it could be maybe possibly a while until we do get any sort of deal. All right, Allie. ThanksALEXANDRA CANAL: Thanks.]"

The first bullet point from the trade group offered a seemingly tantalizing concession to striking writers: the largest wage increase in 35 years.In reality, it amounted to a 5% raise in the first year.The small salary bump proposed to the movie and TV writers is in stark contrast to the far bigger gains made just this week by American Airlines pilots and the UPS Teamsters—the nation’s largest private-sector union. American Airlines pilots approved a new labor agreement Tuesday that would give its members 21% raises immediately, with a 46% increase over the four-year contract. And the UPS Teamsters union got a 35% increase in its minimum member pay.By comparison, writers union members would get just one-seventh of what UPS union members and one fourth of what the pilots union received in the first year of their contracts.The three-year deal offered by the AMPTP would give the WGA, the union representing screenwriters, additional pay increases of 4% and 3.5% in the second and third years of the contract.The WGA and AMPTP did not respond to requests for comment.Negotiations between the writers and the studios have been acrimonious. Even the studios merely making their counteroffer public was criticized. The writers union said the move was meant to divide members, by trying to get them to squabble over which parts of the counterproposal should be kept or negotiated further. “It is their only strategy—to bet that we will turn on each other,” the WGA wrote in a statement.Story continuesThe studios’ proposal was released after a Tuesday meeting of studio executives including Disney CEO Bob Iger, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, and Universal Filmed Entertainment Group chair Donna Langley. The WGA called into question whether the executives even intended to reach an agreement. “This wasn’t a meeting to make a deal,” the writers union statement said. “This was a meeting to get us to cave, which is why, not 20 minutes after we left the meeting, the AMPTP released its summary of their proposals.”What else are the WGA and the AMPTP still negotiating over?Similar to those of UPS drivers and American Airlines pilots, WGA members’ demands go beyond just pay increases; the union originally asked for first-year pay raises of 6% and 5% in the following two years—as well as changes to on-the-job working conditions.The AMPTP counterproposal also included some protections against A.I.-written scripts—a major point of contention—to ensure that they not be considered literary material. The proposal would mean writers wouldn’t lose any compensation if A.I. were used to create a script that they also contributed to. In the past the WGA has been open to using A.I. so long as it didn’t come at the expense of writers’ credits and take-home pay.The studio’s counteroffer made some concessions to another of the technological upheavals created by Silicon Valley: residuals for streaming. For the first time, studios and streamers appear open to the idea of reporting data regarding streaming viewership. Under the current proposal, the WGA would get access to “quarterly confidential reports” that would include the hours viewed per streamed program. The statement includes language promising to restructure current standards for residual payments—or rather nonpayments—for content that goes on streaming platforms.In the past streaming data has been kept confidential by streaming services and studios. This reluctance to share viewership numbers means that writers and actors for hit shows don’t earn extra residual payments for streamed content as they might for television or for theatrical releases. That can sometimes cost writers and actors big money. In 2021, actress Scarlett Johansson sued Disney for breach of contract when it premiered a feature film she starred in both in theaters and on its recently launched Disney+ streaming service. Johansson alleged that the decision was made partly to avoid paying her bigger box-office-related bonuses. The suit was later settled out of court for a reported $40 million.Another major sticking point in the negotiations is the number of writers that showrunners will be allowed to hire. The WGA’s original proposal required a minimum of five writers, while the AMPTP’s recent counteroffer was two writers, with the option to add more for longer shows. The proposal also addresses WGA demands that some writers be kept on staff through the entire production so they can gain production experience, beyond the writers’ room.If the UPS and American Airlines labor agreements are any indication, a strained relationship during negotiations doesn’t preclude unions from securing the wages and benefits they’re seeking. Negotiations between UPS and its union employees were considered dead just days before workers were to go on strike, and American Airlines pilots rejected multiple deals going back to November of last year. It got so bad that just days after rival United Airlines finalized a deal with its pilots union, Ed Sicher, president of the union representing American Airlines pilots, issued a press release titled, “Will They Attempt to Lowball Us Again?” But a few weeks later, he was celebrating a deal that offered “substantial monetary gains and quality-of-life improvements.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

309,1ce0dedb-379d-335d-9a48-fbb942decd92,DIS,2023-08-24,"Column: Ron DeSantis has a new attack on Disney, and it's truly stupid",LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-ron-desantis-attack-disney-182930217.html,1692815370,STORY,['DIS'],"[Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis: Not ""moved on"" from his fight with Disney quite yet (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The eyes of the political world will be on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during Wednesday night's GOP debate.For most observers, the question will be whether DeSantis can salvage his fading presidential ambitions from the Milwaukee stage. My question is: Will the TV makeup artists be able to conceal the injuries he's sustained by stepping on another rake in his campaign against Walt Disney Co.?DeSantis' latest misstep is an assault on Disney World discounts and other modest perks traditionally enjoyed by employees of the special district set up to oversee the land and infrastructure serving the park.In addition to constituting unethical benefits and perks, the scheme raises significant questions regarding self-dealing.DeSantis's Disney World board complains about employee perksThe governor's oversight board of hand-picked stooges on Monday filed a complaint to Florida's state inspector general accusing the company of paying ""unethical benefits and perks"" to the district's workers and their families.The board said ""the scheme raises significant questions regarding self-dealing"" by its predecessor board, since those five members were supposedly in line, along with about 400 other district employees and their families, to receive discounts on park tickets, hotel stays and merchandise.Sounds pretty serious, no? Well, no. More on that in a moment. First, a quick gallop through the back story.It will be remembered that the conflict between DeSantis and Disney began when the company's former chairman, Bob Chapek, publicly criticized DeSantis' so-called Don’t Say Gay law, which is aimed at suppressing discussions of gender issues in public school classrooms.DeSantis retaliated by moving to revoke Disney’s near-dictatorial control over the 43-square-mile territory on which Disney World and its related parks and resorts are located.The parcel outside Orlando was then known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District and was governed by a five-member board of Disney allies until DeSantis swung into action.Story continuesRead more: Column: Ron DeSantis and the whitewashing of slavery's horrorsThe district had been created in a deal between Walt Disney and Florida’s then-Republican governor, Claude Kirk, signed into law in 1967. The goal was to enable Disney to avoid the honky-tonk character of development around Disneyland in Anaheim, and instead keep the Florida property in perfectly coiffed white-bread comeliness.DeSantis, who seems to view everything in the world through a bile duct (hat-tip to novelist R.A. Lafferty for the turn of phrase), sought and received the state legislature's permission to fire the Reedy Creek board and replace it with his own cronies. He did so in March. Also, the district was renamed the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.Since then, the governor and the company have been in open combat. Just before the changeover, Disney signed long-term agreements with the old board, effectively stripping its successors of all their authority over development.The new board has sued to nullify those agreements. Disney has sued back, charging the governor with illegally retaliating against the company for speaking its mind. At the moment, Disney appears to have the upper hand in this fight, though the outcome will probably be in the hands of state and federal judges.In any event, DeSantis told CNBC on Aug. 14 that he has ""basically moved on"" from the conflict and urged Disney to drop its lawsuit. Disney's response was ""not so fast"": It promptly filed a motion seeking damages from the DeSantis administration for trampling over its free-speech rights.That brings us to the latest installment of this farcical affair. That's the referral to the state inspector general filed by the current oversight board.The board asserts that the discounts on hotels, merchandise, food and beverages granted the district's employees and their families ""cost taxpayers over $2.5 million"" last year alone. The board put forth this figure as though it's a burden on the good taxpaying souls of Orange and Osceola counties, where the district sits.Actually, it's nothing of the kind. Who pays taxes to the district? Disney, that's who. In other words, Disney has been charging itself for the cost of keeping the district's workers just a little bit happier.Read more: Column: Disney lawsuit shows Ron DeSantis at his bullying, bumbling worstAccording to the district's financial reports, Disney and its associated resorts account for 95% of the district's assessed valuation, the basis of its tax revenues, which in turn provide 97.4% of its budget. The balance of the assessed valuation and the tax revenues comes from hotels, movie theaters, shops and other entities, which all are Disney's tenants. The $2.5 million was about 1.5% of the district's operating budget last year.Who gets these benefits? For the most part, they're district employees, of which there were 392 last year, and their families. The board grouses that the former board members also received ""VIP Main Entrance passes"" to the parks, but it's hard to say that these were significant drains on the district's bottom line.As for the ethical implications of all this, it seems that the district board had a teensy ethical issue of its own when it made the referral to the inspector general.Glen Gilzean, who was appointed administrator of the tourism district in April, also served as the chair of the Florida state Commission on Ethics. The problem is that members of that commission aren't permitted to hold any public office.Gilzean resigned from his commission post, which is unpaid, on Tuesday, choosing to keep his district job, which pays $400,000 a year. He said in his resignation letter that he had no idea that holding both jobs was a no-no, which only raises the question of how he got the job as commission chair if he was so ignorant of this fundamental fact. (He was appointed to the commission by DeSantis.)The ethics commission's general counsel recalls events differently. He wrote in an Aug. 17 legal opinion that the commission's executive director told Gilzean flatly on April 26 that he couldn't hold both jobs. Someone is lying. I wonder who.Put it all together, and it looks as though DeSantis and his lackeys haven't ""moved on"" from their fight with Disney at all.We should be grateful: As long as Hollywood's actors and writers are on strike, someone has to generate entertainment content.

(WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and NBCUniversal (CMCSA), released the terms of its proposal, which the Writers Guild of America (WGA) denied in a face-to-face meeting with studio executives earlier that day.By releasing the details of the counterproposal, the AMPTP is hoping the package will sway members and encourage the guild to accept the deal.According to the AMPTP, the contract is ""a comprehensive package which addresses all of the issues the Guild has identified as its highest priorities,"" including higher compensation, increases to streaming residuals, transparency around viewership data, a guaranteed minimum length of employment, and further protections surrounding the use of artificial intelligence.A strike captain, center, leads the chants as strikers walk a picket line outside Warner Bros., Discovery, and Netflix offices in Manhattan, Friday, Aug. 18, 2023. (Mary Altaffer/AP Photo)The proposed wage increase, a compounded 13% jump over the three-year contract, would be the highest increase for the WGA in 35 years, the studios said. Streaming residuals would climb nearly 22% to $87,546 per episode for 3 exhibition years, up from the prior $72,067.The WGA slammed the meet-up in an email to members late Tuesday, lamenting the proposal didn't come close to satisfying the writers' demands.""This wasn’t a meeting to make a deal. This was a meeting to get us to cave, which is why, not twenty minutes after we left the meeting, the AMPTP released its summary of their proposals,"" the WGA wrote, adding the proposal's ""limitations and loopholes and omissions failed to sufficiently protect writers from the existential threats that caused us to strike in the first place.""""Our priority is to end the strike so that valued members of the creative community can return to what they do best and to end the hardships that so many people and businesses that service the industry are experiencing,"" wrote AMPTP president Carol Lombardini.Story continuesStudio executives including Disney CEO Bob Iger, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, and NBCUniversal Studio Group chair Donna Langley attended Tuesday's meeting.The two sides restarted negotiations on Aug. 11 after more than 100 days of no talks. The writers' strike is currently in its 113th day as experts say the cost to the economy could amount to $4 billion.The WGA will continue its picketing on Wednesday.SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — also remains firmly on the picket lines after joining striking writers in mid-July.Scott Purdy, KPMG's US national media leader, told Yahoo Finance the strikes could likely last ""two to three times"" the prior 2007-2008 strike, which lasted for 100 days. That means a work stoppage could run well into 2024.""I really think there's too much pain to miss an entire other season,"" Purdy said.

Ron DeSantis over a decision to eliminate their access to free passes and discounts to the theme park resort, saying it makes park visits unaffordable.During a monthly board meeting, several current and former district firefighters spoke emotionally about how the free passes to Disney parks were a benefit for them and their families that played a major role in their decision to work for the 56-year-old district, which provides municipal services like mosquito control, drainage, wastewater treatment, planning and firefighting to Disney World.“The removal of this benefit takes away, for some, their entire reason for working here,” said firefighter Pete Simon.The Central Florida Tourism Oversight District earlier this week said that $2.5 million in season passes and discounts on hotels, merchandise, food and beverages that their Disney-supporting predecessors provided the district's 400 employees amounted to unethical perks that benefited the company, with the district footing the bill. The district on Monday submitted a complaint to a state Inspector General, which investigates fraud, mismanagement, waste and abuse.The five members of the district’s board were appointed by DeSantis earlier this year after his takeover of the district in retaliation for Disney’s opposition to a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades.Firefighter Aaron Clark, whose father was also a district firefighter, choked up as he recounted how growing up his dad took him to the parks using the passes and how he now does the same thing with his three daughters.His father, Ricky Clark, called the elimination of the passes “disturbing” and said that the adversarial attitude the district and DeSantis have taken toward Disney “has nothing to do with district employees.”""My family had many memories at the park, spending time together, memories that can never be taken away,"" Ricky Clark said.Story continuesBoard chair Martin Garcia defended the decision. The passes and discounts unfairly favored Disney over other restaurants and shops that operated within the district, employees with large families got a greater benefit than single employees and a private company can't give gifts to government workers who provide services to it, Garcia said.In its place, the district was offering employees more than $1,400 in a wage increase, he said.The tussle over whether the free passes and discounts were an unethical benefit came as the new district administrator, who board members appointed last May, faced an ethics dilemma of his own. Glen Gilzean, who earns $400,000 annually in his new job, also was chair of the Florida Commission on Ethics. A legal opinion last week said he was unable to simultaneously be a commission board member and work for the district because the commission prohibits public employees from serving on its board.Gilzean announced at Wednesday's board meeting that he had resigned from the ethics commission.A fight between DeSantis and Disney began last year after the company, facing significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed the state law which critics have called, “Don't Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But the new supervisors’ authority over design and construction was restricted by the company’s agreements with Disney-supporting predecessors, which were signed before the new board took over.In response, Florida lawmakers passed legislation that repealed those agreements.Disney has sued DeSantis in federal court, claiming the governor violated the company’s free speech rights. The district has sued Disney in state court, seeking to nullify the agreements.During a budget presentation at Wednesday's meeting, Gilzean said that $4.5 million was targeted for litigation expenses for the 2024 fiscal year, as well as $1.9 million for the 2023 fiscal year.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Churn rose for every major streaming service except for one: Netflix (NFLX).Antenna's data showed churn rates eased slightly, to 3% from 3.1%, for Netflix despite the company rolling out its controversial password-sharing crackdown. Even more bullish news? The platform added about 2.6 million new subscribers in the month of July alone, Antenna said in a separate data set released on Wednesday.Others weren't so lucky. Apple TV+ (AAPL) saw its churn rate jump to 6.4% last month versus 5.5% in July 2022. Churn rates for Disney's (DIS) service rose to 4.6% compared to 4.0% in the year-ago period, while the churn rates for Hulu, Max, and Peacock climbed by 0.8%, 1.1%, and 1.5%, respectively.Overall, Lionsgate's Starz had the highest monthly churn in July compared to other major streaming platforms at a rate of 11.9%, followed by Peacock at 8.7% and Paramount+ at 7.4%.Antenna determined a service's monthly churn rate by dividing cancels in a given month by subscribers at the end of the previous month.""Churn is critical,"" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich told Yahoo Finance. ""It's really one of the biggest issues — having to replace subscribers, the marketing costs. It's just the untold story.""Reif Ehrlich said that in order to reduce churn, companies must focus on three main areas: original content, increased engagement, and a broad range of content. She called out live sports and news as possible content catalysts when it comes to engagement.Story continues""The more time subscribers spend, the less likely they are to churn,"" Reif Ehrlich said.Antenna's report comes as prices have ballooned across all of the major streaming services.Disney became the latest service to raise prices, announcing earlier this month it will raise the monthly price of its ad-free Disney+ and Hulu plans by more than 20% to $13.99 and $17.99, respectively.The price jumps echo competitors as Netflix, Apple TV+, and Max all raised prices over the past year.Added up, the cost of these services now rival the dreaded cable TV bundle of years past — the very thing that streaming set out to undo.Subscriber numbers at major direct-to-consumer services (DTC) including Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max, and Discovery+ were down by about 500,000 combined following this latest earnings season.""Global DTC subscriber growth was 8.5% year-over-year (YoY), slowing to single digits for the first time,"" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a recent note to clients.Despite the overall slowdown, growth was aided by Netflix's password-sharing crackdown, which helped the streamer add 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter. Wider crackdowns on password sharing will likely become the norm as media giants weigh profitability more heavily than subscriber count.Disney said it would be implementing its own crackdown at some point in 2024.As the golden age of streaming seemingly comes to an end, subscribers are cancelling plans to combat rising costs.

Five northern Illinois high schools will each receive a $50,000 grant to purchase electric transportation technology, allowing students a unique opportunity to learn up close about the advantages of driving zero-emissions vehicles.ComEd has awarded a total of $950,000 to 19 high schools in northern Illinois through the competitive grant program since the program first launched in 2019. The EVs for Education program is a component of ComEd’s work to accelerate EV adoption throughout the region, and to deliver on a key goal of the state’s landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which sets a goal of adding one million EVs to Illinois roads by 2030.""The benefits related to EVs are clear, and ComEd is working to remove barriers to adoption to help more customers move toward cleaner transportation, which generates energy savings, reduces pollution and helps bring cleaner air into our communities,"" said Louie Binswanger, SVP of Governmental, Regulatory and External Affairs at ComEd. ""Through our EVs for Education program, we’re working to bring the environmental and health benefits of EVs into more communities by empowering the next generation to play a role in our clean energy future.""Schools selected to participate in the program receive a $50,000 grant to help electrify their driver’s education curriculum by adding at least one EV to their existing vehicle fleet and purchasing at least one Level 2 EV charger. The program has a goal of empowering students on new clean energy technology, while helping reduce barriers for school communities where EV access is limited.Story continuesThe schools selected to participate in the 2023-2024 EVs for Education program are:Bloom Trail High School, Chicago HeightsBremen High School, MidlothianDwight D Eisenhower High School, Blue IslandRockford East High School, RockfordSterling High School, Sterling""We are excited to partner with ComEd on the EVs for Education initiative,"" said Rockford Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Greg Brown.

""By securing this grant, our School District is proving how we continue to find ways to provide the best opportunities to prepare our students for the future both inside and outside the classroom. We appreciate the partnership with ComEd in helping provide this opportunity.""To be eligible for an EVs for Education grant, applicants must offer a public-school driver’s education program and be located in the ComEd service region. Equity is a central component of the program, and ComEd prioritizes applications for funding from school districts serving a predominantly low-income student population, and those located in an area that is either underserved by EV access/charging or suffering from lower air quality conditions due to pollution.""Through ComEd’s grant Sterling High School students will have the opportunity to experience an EV when learning to drive,"" said Matt Birdsley, Director of Finance and Chief School Business Official for Sterling Public Schools. ""These funds bring an EV and much needed charging infrastructure to Sterling, Illinois, where EVs are beginning to see increased demand, yet as charging infrastructure is only just being implemented for the city.""ComEd worked with the Illinois High School &amp; College Driver Education Association (IHSCDEA) to develop curriculum for the program. In addition to providing students with experience behind the wheel of an EV, the program teaches them to identify the vehicle's basic components, understand charging requirements, and how to operate and charge an EV responsibly.""The IHSCDEA is very excited about the ComEd EVs for Education program, helping more public high school driver education students experience the differences between internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles,"" said Wayne Hartmann, IHSCDEA Technology Coordinator. ""These differences, which include handling characteristics, driving strategies, fueling techniques, and maintenance, are important for students to experience first-hand under the supervision of a qualified instructor. EV usage is certainly on the rise, and the program will equip students as they begin to interact with EVs more and more on our roadways.""EVs are on the rise in Illinois, and provide customers an opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint, enhance air quality for their communities, while also saving EV drivers money from avoided maintenance and fuel costs.To help customers understand and unlock the benefits of EVs, ComEd offers the EV Toolkit, a one-stop-shop to empower customers with information on rebates, current EVs and EV chargers available for purchase, where to find public charging, and an individual cost calculator. ComEd also recently announced a $231 million investment to accelerate EV adoption, which will fund a variety of new rebates, rates and other customer programs over the next three years to accelerate the adoption of electrified technologies, including EVs.

""So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.""A similar warning came this month from the world's largest retailer, Walmart.""Jobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers. But rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs and tightening lending standards, and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told Wall Street when the retailer reported earnings.Federal student loans will begin to accrue interest again on Sept. 1, with payments resuming on Oct. 1.Read more: Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could helpTransUnion's head of global research and consulting Charlie Wise tells Yahoo Finance that roughly 40 million consumers will face the ""payment shock"" when student debt relief ends.A man carries flowers and balloons during Los Angeles Mission College's 48th annual commencement ceremony on June 6, 2023. (Hans Gutknecht/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images via Getty Images)Consumers were already having trouble paying off credit card debt, as Macy's warned this week. Now, the return of student loan payments could make financial matters worse, with execs warning that the extra expense may lead consumers to pull back spending in other areas.Yahoo Finance takes a look at the consumer stocks with the most at risk.Retailers with most student loan payment exposureSome retailers appear more vulnerable to repayment shock than others heading into the crucial back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.Story continues""We are most cautious on brands with high exposure to student debt holders and inferior value perceptions amongst 18-34-year-olds, the most representative demographic of student debt holders,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients.The research team at TD Cowen highlighted Target (TGT) and Ulta (ULTA) as particularly vulnerable, due to their exposure to younger, low-income consumers with student loans.""The resumption of student loan repayments is one of many factors that we're watching really closely,"" Target CFO Michael Fiddelke told Yahoo Finance as the retailer slashed its full-year profit outlook.Other ""most-exposed"" stocks to younger, lower-income student borrowers, according to TD Cowen analysts, include Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), FIGS (FIGS), Foot Locker (FL), Burlington Stores (BURL), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote that US student debt borrowers will likely pull back spending on apparel overall since they ""prefer brands over private label and specialty retailers over discounters.""This is bad news for American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Carter's (CRI), Crocs (CROX), Canada Goose (GOOS), The Gap (GPS), Nordstrom (JWN), Nike (NKE), Steven Madden (SHOO), Under Armour (UAA), and Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. (VSCO), Sole said.Stores with a higher discretionary product mix also face higher risk, according to JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers.That includes Target and Ulta, Horvers noted, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Best Buy (BBY), followed by Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Costco (COST), and Walmart, with the primary difference driven by the former group's higher mix of discretionary product.On the flip side, auto parts stocks are less at risk ""given their lower-income exposure and low discretionary mix,"" Horvers wrote in a note to investors.Meanwhile, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) ""remains a question mark"" as its ""geo-weighted exposure to student loans ranks it high offset by its largely non-discretionary mix (85% grocery),"" Horvers added.Restaurants watch for sales weaknessWhen it comes to spending at restaurants, TD Cowen's Charles said he estimates up to ""a 2% annual headwind to restaurant industry spending as student loan payments resume.""The team at TD Cowen suggested Jack in the Box (JACK), Dutch Bros (BROS), and Sweetgreen (SG) may face headwinds. Investors should also tread lightly with tobacco and beverage brands, such as Altria Group (MO), British American Tobacco (BATS), and Monster Beverage (MNST).Even higher-end plays in the restaurant space aren't immune.Cava — where a salad bowl can set one back $14 — expressed caution on the consumer outlook in its latest earnings.CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance that student loan payments restarting was one of the ""multitude of factors"" up against consumers, along with higher gas prices, costly utility bills, and a ""hawkish Fed.""""So we're mindful of those pressures,"" Schulman said. ""We saw a resilient consumer in Q2, but we'd be remiss if we didn't take those considerations into account.""Of course, not all borrowers will have to pay right away.Those still in school remain ""in the regular forbearance period,"" TransUnion's Wise points out. ""But we think that about 26 million-27 million consumers will be facing the beginning or resumption of payments in the next couple of weeks.""There's another catch: The Department of Education is instituting a 12-month ""on-ramp"" for repayment from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today released the results of a new survey of IT and security professionals on the prevalence and effectiveness of specialized third-party solutions that combat the challenges of malicious bots, account takeover (ATO), third-party scripts, and audience hijacking.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)From Bad Bots to Malicious Scripts: The Effectiveness of Specialized Defenses found that not only are these protective technologies prevalent, but the companies using them have seen significant, quantifiable improvement in their ability to mitigate risk and prevent damage to their organizations and customers.Akamai partnered with Foundry on the report, which surveyed more than 300 global IT and security decision-makers. Respondents were asked about the solutions they had in place for four broad categories of fraud and abuse: malicious bots, ATO attacks, script risks, and audience hijacking.Malicious botsAlmost nine out of 10 respondents (89 percent) use third-party solutions or a combination of third-party and in-house solutions to combat malicious bots. Nearly all (97 percent) reported an improvement in their efforts to combat bots, with more than half (54 percent) of those using third-party solutions indicating their cybersecurity capabilities have improved significantly since deployment. Of those who saw significant improvement, the top three capabilities and gains most frequently mentioned were:The ability to handle high heat events and surges in traffic (47 percent)An improvement in marketing effectiveness (42 percent)The ability to balance security controls with performance optimization (41 percent)Account takeover (ATO)More than three-quarters (79 percent) of respondents said their businesses had been targeted by ATO attacks in the past 12 months. Two-thirds of survey takers said that their cybersecurity capabilities had significantly improved since deploying specialized ATO defenses, while 31 percent said they had somewhat improved. The most frequently reported gains by those who saw significant improvement were:Story continuesThe ability to detect fraudulent or suspicious activity (44 percent)Visibility into indicators of account compromise (41 percent)The ability to detect fraudulent or suspicious logins (39 percent)Script risksMore than eight in 10 (81 percent) respondents said their organizations have been targeted by suspicious script behavior within the past 12 months. Essentially all (98 percent) of those using third-party specialized script protection solutions say their cybersecurity capabilities have improved at least somewhat since their deployment. More specifically, 71 percent of those using third-party solutions saw a significant reduction in abusive script behaviors, with another 24 percent seeing moderate reduction. Of those who saw significant improvement, the three most frequently reported gains were:The ability to detect compromised first and third-party scripts (38 percent)The ability to prioritize events that require investigation (38 percent)The ability to meet compliance requirements (38 percent)Audience hijackingJust over one-quarter (26 percent) of survey takers said their organizations have been impacted by audience hijacking tactics. According to the report, those who had experienced audience hijacking said the top two effects on their businesses were increased cart abandonment (43 percent) and increased affiliate fraud (41 percent).""Malicious bots, scripts, and ATO attacks are pervasive and will continue to pose ever greater challenges for commerce organizations as digital innovation and investment drives competitive advantage and customer loyalty,"" said Patrick Sullivan, VP and CTO, Akamai Security Strategy.

Highlights include:United States●       Nine in 10 organizations said they'd been targeted by ATO attacks within the past year, the highest rate of all three regions. More than 9 in 10 (93 percent) have deployed a specialized ATO solution — higher than the overall response rate (83 percent).The U.S. faces the highest rate of bot attacks, with 88 percent having experienced an attack in the past year (well above the 75 percent overall response), and nearly all U.S. organizations (96 percent) have a specialized solution in place.Almost every respondent (94 percent) was affected by suspicious script behavior over the prior 12 months.The majority of U.S. respondents (94 percent) are aware of audience hijacking and nearly 4 in 10 (39 percent) said they have been impacted by it (well above the overall rate of 26 percent).EuropeJust under three-quarters (73 percent) of organizations said they'd been targeted by ATO attacks within the past year, slightly less than the overall response (78 percent).Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of European respondents experienced bot attacks, a significant figure though slightly less than the 75 percent overall rate.Europe had the lowest rate (72 percent) of organizations targeted by suspicious script behavior.

Shares have lost about 1.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is F5 due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.F5's Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues Miss EstimatesF5 reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top line missed but the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates.This Seattle, WA-based company’s non-GAAP earnings of $3.21 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.86. The bottom line increased 24.9% from the year-ago quarter’s $2.57 per share and was way higher than management’s guided range of $2.78-$2.90 per share. The robust bottom-line performance was mainly driven by higher revenues, the benefits of price realization and easing supply-chain constraints and related costs.F5 revenues of $702.6 million for the third quarter fell short of the consensus mark of $703.2 million. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 4.2% and came well above the midpoint of management’s guidance range of $690-$710 million despite persistent macroeconomic uncertainties and tight budgets of customers.F5 stated that better sales execution mainly boosted the top-line performance. The company also noted that it is witnessing early signs of stabilization in demand as third-quarter demand remained above what it had expected at the beginning of the quarter. Moreover, though third-quarter demand was way lower than the year-ago quarter level, it remained higher than the first and second quarters of the current fiscal.Top Line in DetailProduct revenues (47% of total revenues), which comprise the Software and Systems sub-divisions, increased 1% year over year to $328.2 million. The rise in Product revenues was mainly driven by increased sales of Systems, partially offset by a decline in Software sales. The company’s reported non-GAAP Product revenues were slightly lower than our estimates of $333.8 million.Story continuesSystems revenues grew 5% year over year to $155 million, accounting for approximately 47% of the total Product revenues. Though the demand for Systems products remained constrained, the segment benefited from supply-chain normalization and better execution in reducing the backlog. Our estimates for Systems revenues were pegged at $190.1 million.Industry-wide supply-chain constraints for components in 2022 had severely hurt F5’s Systems segment’s overall performance. However, a continuously improving supply chain for the past couple of quarters has been helping the company clear its backlog, thereby boosting its Systems top line.However, the benefits of higher Systems sales were partially offset by weak performance in Software. Software revenues declined 3% year over year to $174 million in the third quarter, mainly due to tough comparisons. Nonetheless, Software sales improved 32% sequentially, reflecting strong growth in renewals. Our estimates for Software’s third-quarter revenues were pegged at $143.7 million.Global Service revenues (53% of the total revenues) grew 8% to $374 million. The robust growth was mainly driven by price increases introduced last year and the benefits of high-maintenance renewals. Our estimates for Global Services revenues were pegged at $362.4 million.F5 Networks registered sales growth across the Americas and EMEA regions, witnessing a year-over-year increase of 3% and 16%, respectively. However, revenues from the APAC region plunged 6% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue contributions from the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions were 57%, 26% and 18%, respectively.Customer-wise, Enterprises, Service providers and Government represented 66%, 13% and 21% of product bookings, respectively.MarginsOn a year-over-year basis, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins contracted 80 basis points (bps) and 70 bps to 79.8% and 82.5%, respectively. However, sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins expanded 190 bps and 210 bps, respectively. The company noted that the sequential improvement was primarily driven by price realization and ease in supply-chain constraints, as well as reductions in ancillary supply-chain costs.While GAAP operating expenses went up 4.8% to $457.4 million, non-GAAP operating expenses declined 5.7% to $346 million. GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 65.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 from 64.7% in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 49.2% from 54.4% in the year-ago quarter.F5 Networks’ GAAP operating profit declined 2.8% to $104 million, while the margin contracted 120 bps to 14.7% However, the non-GAAP operating profit jumped 20% year over year to $233 million, while the margin improved 440 bps to 33.2%. An increase in the non-GAAP operating margin was primarily driven by higher revenues and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a contraction in the gross margin.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowF5 Networks exited the June-ended quarter with cash and short-term investments of $690.6 million compared with the previous quarter’s $755.3 million.The company generated operating cash flow of $165 million in the third quarter and $463.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.During the quarter, FFIV repurchased shares worth $250 million. In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, it bought back common stocks worth $290 million. As of Jul 24, 2023, F5 had $982 million remaining under its current authorized share repurchase program. So far in fiscal 2023, the company has utilized about 68% of its free cash flow toward share buybacks compared with its commitment of using at least 50% of free cash flow for share buybacks announced at the beginning of fiscal 2023.GuidanceF5 Networks projects non-GAAP revenues in the $690-$710 million band (midpoint of $700 million) and non-GAAP earnings per share in the $3.15-$3.27 band (midpoint of $3.21) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The non-GAAP gross margin is forecast to be around 83%.Considering the full-quarter benefits of cost-reduction initiatives announced in April 2023, the company expects fourth-quarter non-GAAP operating expenses between $338 million and $350 million. Share-based compensation expenses are anticipated in the range of $55-$57 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, F5 has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

But not anymore. Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jason English explains that millennials, who are now the ones forming households, don't share that same stigma. English, who covers consumer staples stocks, says it presents a problem for companies who bank on having well-known brands.When it comes to his coverage, English is not favoring General Mills (GIS), Campbell Soup (CPB), or J.M. Smucker (SJM), because they have ""underperformed"" and ""their businesses are really going to be challenged."" As for stocks he likes, ""we want more global-facing businesses,"" English says, highlighting Mondelez (MDLZ) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL). English also likes BellRing Brands (BRBR) saying the company is ""absolutely on fire.""Video Transcript- Jason how is all of this feeding through into store or generic brands? Are we seeing that trade-down effect?JASON ENGLISH: We are seeing it, Julie. And we can debate, is this a sign of overall consumer weakness or is this a sign of a secular trend that was in place before COVID? I would argue it's the latter. I grew up and my generation grew up in an era where private label was kind of cheap knockoff product.The younger generation, the millennial generation, is now forming households and pushing the largest basket down the grocery aisle grew up in a very different environment, where private label doesn't have the same stigma. Meanwhile, retailers have really made it a priority to push their own brands to engender loyalty within the store.Those dynamics were disrupted during COVID primarily because of supply. Those disruptions are behind us and we're now seeing once again the secular trend of the rise of store brands or retailers own brands or private label, whatever you want to call it, that trend is back and it's back and forth, which makes it even harder.If you're one of these branded guys operating in the center store, the consumption is shrinking there. Consumers. are sharing stomach to perimeter fresh, real foods. And then within those categories, you're losing share to the retail brands. It has a compounding effect that makes the businesses even more challenging.Story continues- And so Jason, we've been looking through of course, your coverage list just to see where you're a little bit more bullish. And perhaps on the other end of that spectrum, very bearish. So what are some of your top picks as of right now as you look across the environment, think about what we've seen from the consumer over the course of back-to-school season, and even what that's projected to look like as we get into the holiday season?JASON ENGLISH: Yeah, good question. So you mentioned I've got a bearish bent. I probably have more celebrating to find with most sell side analysts out there. So we have a lot of conviction in some of our sells that are suffering from all these dynamics they talked about, particularly US-centric centers for food companies like General Mills, like Campbell's Soup, like Smucker's, they've underperformed. I think their businesses are really going to be challenged. I see no catalysts for relative rerating or outperformance going forward. So we remain very comfortable there.On the flip side, we want more global-facing businesses. Emerging market consumer is holding up really well, especially in Latin America. Pockets of Southeast Asia, there's real growth there. So I want some more global reaching companies who can tap into that growth I'm going to lean into Mondelez, the snack food, the maker of Oreo, Cadbury, et cetera, really thriving in this environment. And I expect it to continue to thrive.And on the personal care side of my coverage universe, we're going to lean into Colgate at least amongst our large-cap. We got some nice small-cap names to mid-cap names with some really good product cycles. One in particular would be BellRing Brands, where they make protein shakes after nutrition. It's absolutely on fire, more capacity, costs relief on the comp.So I've got names I like but at the same time, the other side, I got some companies with some real pressures that I would look to avoid.]"

But output of oil in the largest producing country hit new three-year highs, a government report showed on Wednesday, as supply-demand of the commodity remained volatile from persistent Saudi attempts to squeeze a market at a crossroads due to the sluggish economy in top importing nation China.U.S. gasoline inventories registered a surprise build last week against expectations for a drop, while the growth in distillates was four times more than forecast, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report.Crude stockpiles fell by 6.135M barrels during the week ended Aug. 18, following through with the 5.960M decline in the prior week to Aug. 11, the EIA said. Industry analysts tracked by Investing.com had forecast a drop of just 2.850M for last week.But on the gasoline inventory front, the EIA reported a build of 1.467M barrels, after a slide of 0.261M barrels last week. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.888M for last week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, there was a climb of 0.945M barrels versus the prior week’s gain of 0.296M. Analysts had predicted a build of just 0.218M for last week. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships, and fuel for jets.The EIA’s reports on oil and fuel inventories have turned volatile lately as global stockpiles see shifts from Saudi and Russian maneuvers to slash exports amid slower buying from China.Inventory levels aside, the EIA report was noteworthy for the new three-year high estimates that it made for U.S. oil production.Crude output was projected at 12.8M barrels per day during the week to Aug. 18, making it the agency’s highest such estimate since the record 13.1M barrels produced daily before the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020.Story continuesOver the past three weeks, the EIA has constantly raised production estimates for oil by 100,000 barrels each week under a new reporting methodology that accounts for oil potentially flowing from oil wells that are other than those drilled and uncompleted -- referred to in the industry as DUCs.“Earlier this year the EIA revised the number of drilled but uncompleted wells in the top U.S. shale basin, adding several years’ worth of unreported DUCs,” said Phil Flynn, energy analyst at Chicago brokerage Price Futures Group.Flynn said the revisions imply that drilling-rig productivity has been higher than past estimates despite the U.S. oil rig count having fallen by more than 15% this year.The EIA “believes active drilling rigs were about 10% more productive in 2021–2022 than previously estimated”, Flynn added.Related ArticlesOil: U.S. stocks down 6M barrels, output at new 3-year highExclusive-Insurers raise premiums for Black Sea tankers as tensions mount - tradersGold prices push past $1,900 as dollar, yields cool]"

The offer included wage increases and AI protections, but the deal was denied by the WGA. Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down what else the offer entailed.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Hollywood studios is releasing the details of their latest offer to screenwriters in a bid to end the ongoing strike. The new offer, well, it includes higher pay and protections against AI. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the latest details for us. Allie, are we getting any closer to a deal?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, it's an interesting tactic by the studios to release this proposal publicly. They're doing this to put some pressure on the Guild, which actually denied the proposal in a meeting late last night. The two sides meeting face to face for the first time in a long time.We had some pretty prominent executives there like Disney CEO Bob Iger, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, WBD CEO David Zaslav. But the Guild slammed the meet up in a follow-up email to members saying, quote, ""This wasn't a meeting to make a deal. This was a meeting to get us to cave.So some pretty fighting words there. They essentially said that this deal didn't even come close to addressing all of their concerns. They still want a mandatory number of writers to be staffed on every shown in addition to bonuses based on how popular a show is on a streaming service. But this is-- what you're seeing on your screen now is what the studios did offer.And from their perspective, they believe that they really hit all the main points that the writers were asking for. We see a higher compensation, increases to streaming residuals, further protections around AI, a guaranteed minimum length of employment, and more transparency around viewership data so writers can actually understand the popularity of their work.And just to get even more specific here, the studios said the proposed wage increase would be a compounded 13% jump over the three-year contract. And that would actually be the highest increase for the WGA in 13 years. And then on the streaming residual side, that would jump by 22%.Story continuesSo they think they came up with a fair deal. Writers say no. It's a lose-lose situation. That's what I'm hearing from analysts right now. I mean, writers are out of work. You know, they have livelihoods that are just on hold right now. And then on the studio side, they're strapped for cash.They're bleeding money. Streaming profitability is still a major issue. And we're going to eventually hit a point where we're going to run out of content. So at some point, some people are even predicting in 2024. So it could go on for that long.- Wow, that would be long.ALEXANDRA CANAL: The pain on both sides is just going to be too much. So it's just how long can both sides hold out here?- That's a good question. And apparently, the writers are also asking for a cut of the rewards when it comes to revenue. Could this be a sticking point, especially as analysts predict Netflix is about to have a huge cash injection?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I mean, Netflix is doing really well with some of their revenue initiatives like the crackdown on password sharing, the ad-supported tier. I do think that's going to be a sticking point. They want a cut. If a show is doing really well on a streaming service. And bringing in subscribers, the writers are saying they deserve some-- a piece, at least, of that pie.But again, the streamers are really hesitant to set a precedent here, the studios are, because if they sign something, if they commit to giving a cut to the writers and then they're not able to make money in the end, that's going to be an issue. So it's not just coming up with a contract for today. It's thinking about where the industry is going to be in the next 5, 10 years.I mean, the last writers strike in 2007, no one would have ever predicted the explosion of streaming that we're seeing today. So it's a really challenging environment to try and think of a deal and come up with a way that both sides can sort of reach this compromise. But clearly, the writers right now believe that they have the upper hand.- And it sounds like it could be maybe possibly a while until we do get any sort of deal. All right, Allie. ThanksALEXANDRA CANAL: Thanks.]"

(WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and NBCUniversal (CMCSA), released the terms of its proposal, which the Writers Guild of America (WGA) denied in a face-to-face meeting with studio executives earlier that day.By releasing the details of the counterproposal, the AMPTP is hoping the package will sway members and encourage the guild to accept the deal.According to the AMPTP, the contract is ""a comprehensive package which addresses all of the issues the Guild has identified as its highest priorities,"" including higher compensation, increases to streaming residuals, transparency around viewership data, a guaranteed minimum length of employment, and further protections surrounding the use of artificial intelligence.A strike captain, center, leads the chants as strikers walk a picket line outside Warner Bros., Discovery, and Netflix offices in Manhattan, Friday, Aug. 18, 2023. (Mary Altaffer/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The proposed wage increase, a compounded 13% jump over the three-year contract, would be the highest increase for the WGA in 35 years, the studios said. Streaming residuals would climb nearly 22% to $87,546 per episode for 3 exhibition years, up from the prior $72,067.The WGA slammed the meet-up in an email to members late Tuesday, lamenting the proposal didn't come close to satisfying the writers' demands.""This wasn’t a meeting to make a deal. This was a meeting to get us to cave, which is why, not twenty minutes after we left the meeting, the AMPTP released its summary of their proposals,"" the WGA wrote, adding the proposal's ""limitations and loopholes and omissions failed to sufficiently protect writers from the existential threats that caused us to strike in the first place.""""Our priority is to end the strike so that valued members of the creative community can return to what they do best and to end the hardships that so many people and businesses that service the industry are experiencing,"" wrote AMPTP president Carol Lombardini.Story continuesStudio executives including Disney CEO Bob Iger, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, and NBCUniversal Studio Group chair Donna Langley attended Tuesday's meeting.The two sides restarted negotiations on Aug. 11 after more than 100 days of no talks. The writers' strike is currently in its 113th day as experts say the cost to the economy could amount to $4 billion.The WGA will continue its picketing on Wednesday.SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — also remains firmly on the picket lines after joining striking writers in mid-July.Scott Purdy, KPMG's US national media leader, told Yahoo Finance the strikes could likely last ""two to three times"" the prior 2007-2008 strike, which lasted for 100 days. That means a work stoppage could run well into 2024.""I really think there's too much pain to miss an entire other season,"" Purdy said.

The distribution of these grants is part of Comcast’s ongoing commitment to supporting the growth of all small businesses, while advancing the objectives of diversity, equity, inclusion and community investment.“I want to thank Comcast for its commitment to taking tangible actions that can drive long-term impact for change,” said Portland City Commissioner Carmen Rubio at a Comcast RISE launch event at the Portland Mercato on May 30, 2023. “Collaborations like these, with leaders like Comcast stepping up to the plate, show us that we all have a part to play in the solution. When our economy thrives locally and inclusively, neighborhoods, families, communities and businesses, we all benefit.”Comcast is particularly focused on uplifting small businesses, as they make up 95% of all companies in Portland. Nearly 600 small businesses in Multnomah County submitted applications for the Comcast RISE grants. Still recovering from pandemic-related economic downturn, many small businesses need external support to navigate the ever-changing commercial landscape. Small businesses are a dynamic element in Portland and part of what makes the city unique. SmartAssets reports that approximately 24% of Multnomah County locals have small business incomes.“During the past two and a half years, we have listened to feedback and taken the learnings from this program and have found new ways to further empower and strengthen even more small businesses and entrepreneurs, who are the backbone of our economy and local communities,” said Loren Hudson, SVP and Chief Diversity Officer for Comcast Cable. “By offering grant packages that include complimentary marketing, technology, financial grants, business consulting, entrepreneurship training, we can further our efforts to positively impact small businesses, into 2024 and beyond, and help them to shift from pandemic recovery to long-term growth.”Story continues“I started Sparkly Gowns as an online store and opened the brick-and-mortar location in 2022. This grant from Comcast Rise will help me grow my business. I want to improve my online presence, increase my marketing and add technology to my retail store. I am from Colombia, and as an immigrant business owner, it makes such a difference to get support,” said Fabiola Cardenas Castellanos, owner of Sparkly Gowns.Nearly 60% of the Multnomah County small business owners who applied identify as a person of color, and 65% report being a female-owned company. This is notable, as small businesses, especially those owned by historically marginalized identities, were hit particularly hard during the pandemic. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research noted that Black-owned small businesses were hardest hit, suffering the steepest decline (41%), followed by Hispanic and Asian American-owned small businesses. In addition, according to a study by the National Association of Women Business Owners, women-owned businesses have been growing at only half the rate of those run by men, namely because women struggle to access capital and other resources to help them succeed.“This grant means a lot for Fisticuts Barbershop, and it comes at the perfect time. As a small-business owner, I had to be incredibly nimble to make it through the pandemic. Now I’m looking to promote and grow Fisticuts. The Comcast RISE grant gives me professional resources to tell my story,” said Roberto Martinez, founder, Fisticuts Barbershop.“I bought Pacific Pie Company in July 2021 with the hope to breathe new life into the space and the community by expanding it into a coffee shop, but over the last couple of years I've run into roadblocks for growth,” said Brook Ramirez, owner of Pacific Pie Company. “The Comcast RISE grant comes at a great time and will allow me to move forward with my vision. It finally feels like all the pieces are falling into place.”Comcast RISE stands for Representation, Investment, Strength and Empowerment.

But then daily declines ensued, attributing to factors like inflation and tech stock valuations. This volatility prompted retail investors to seek safer options like treasuries and money market funds, with short-term fixed-income options returning around 5%. For those seeking higher yield and stability, reliable dividend stocks like these stock gems below can be excellent passive income streams in the future. Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) has consistently paid monthly dividends for 54 years, making it a reliable choice. Despite REIT challenges due to rising interest rates, now could be a good time to invest in O stock with a 5.18% yield. Although its dividend growth averaged 3.73% annually in the past five years.While valid concerns exist, they may be exaggerated. Realty Income mainly holds single-tenant properties under triple-net leases, easing landlord responsibilities. Tenants like 7-Eleven, Dollar General, and Walgreens add stability. While many REITs cut distributions in the pandemic, Realty Income raised its payout contributing to its record of 121 dividend increases since 1994 and 637 consecutive monthly payments. A $3.07 annualized payout per share offers a 5.2% yield with monthly dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat said, don’t presume poor future returns for O stock. With a 5.18% yield and potential price rebound after interest rates normalize, investing now might yield profits.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comDespite ongoing debates, the return to office work could boost traffic volumes and companies pushing hybrid schedules may benefit energy firms like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). Devon presents a strong case as a speculative dividend stock. With a forward yield of 6.1%, it surpasses the sector average of 4.24%. The company’s payout ratio at 43.79% indicates confidence in sustained yield.Story continuesDevon’s quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share offers a remarkable yield of nearly 10%, a rarity in solid companies. DVN stock is undervalued due to falling crude oil prices. Down nearly 20% year-to-date, DVN’s P/E ratio at 5 is much lower than the S&amp;P 500 average of 22. With a 52-week low, this presents an enticing opportunity for patient investors seeking high dividends.Despite Federal Reserve policy risks, Dev on Energy shows potential as a high-yield dividend stock. Despite energy sector challenges, DVN remains a solid long-term investment. As society normalizes, office returns could boost traffic volumes and benefit DVN and other energy firms.Fortis (FTS)5 Utility Stocks to Buy for an Extra Durable PortfolioSource: ShutterstockFortis (NYSE:FTS) is Canada’s largest investor-owned utility, dominant in North America and the Caribbean. Stable regulated assets, solid financials, and a C$22.3 billion capital plan for 2023-2027 with 4-6% dividend growth showcase its resilience.The company unveiled a 5-year C$22.3B capital plan, expecting 6.2% annual rate base growth with a dividend target of 4-6%. Utilities, including Fortis, maintain stable dividends even amid earnings declines. Fortis maintains steady growth, with 50 years of consecutive dividend increases, across economic cycles due to stable demand and regulated operations, ensuring stable cash flow. Its consistent 5% annual bottom line growth over a decade contributes to reduced volatility compared to growth stocks.With a 4% yield, FTS stock exemplifies the high dividend nature of utilities. Fortis allocates about 52% of net income as dividends, surpassing the 20% market average. The company plans 5% annual dividend growth for years, offering stability in uncertain times.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can go to 5 Most Innovative Companies of All Time.Humans have been innovating since they first stepped foot on Earth. For any civilization, innovation was a milestone that changed the way of living. Today’s competitive market environment heavily depends on innovation. Entrepreneurs are constantly looking for unconventional ways to design new products and services to overcome old solutions. With the saturation of global markets, innovation has become critical across all industries. Innovation is a time taking process that requires a thorough understanding of the business idea and proper implementation.As we mentioned earlier, innovation has become a buzzword since the launch of Apple’s first iPhone and it still circulates in the market, the media, and schools. Companies are focused on innovation more than ever before and it has become a prime target for executives. Startup is a new fancy name in the business world and the hype around this word is surreal. You can't understand the dynamics of a startup unless you work on a business idea. There are chances of failure and businesses that entered the market have experienced both success and failure. For instance, Quibi is one of the biggest startup failures in recent times. The short-form American streaming platform generated $1.75 billion from venture capitalists and media houses in two funding rounds. It was a few weeks before the target launch of Quibi when the world went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 6, 2020, Quibi launched its streaming platform in the U.S. and Canada. The company went on to release its streaming platform undermining the sudden shift in the market following the pandemic. A few months later on October 22, Quibi decided to quit its operations. Quibi’s founders pointed out the pandemic to be the root cause of its failure. However, it was the wrong decision-making of the founders which led to a collapse of such a massive investment. Therefore, running a startup and bringing innovation to the market isn't that simple. It requires building up a corporate setup that demands patience, right timing, and a lot of resources. Elon Musk in a podcast with Lex Fridman said, “What matters is the pace of innovation, access to resources, and raw materials.” Story continuesWhy Innovation?For a company, innovation is a tool through which it survives the competition. Creativity is the key aspect of innovation and in business, creativity cultivates unique ideas. Creative ideas play a viable role in producing solutions to problems. However, creative ideas don’t guarantee innovation, but for an idea to be innovative, it must be useful for the consumer. James Chin Moody who holds a Ph.D. in innovation theory believes that innovation is not a noun but rather a process of technological change. Moody who is the CEO of Australian package delivery company, Sendle, while talking to CNBC Make It said:“Innovation is the process of creating the thing, yes, but that’s such a small fraction. It’s the process of taking the thing and convincing someone that they need the thing. The process in the middle is really what we mean when we talk about innovation.”In the modern world, every company has adopted innovation in the form of technology. In the context of business, innovation conceives, develops, delivers, and scales new products and services. In an episode of the Inside the Strategy Room podcast, McKinsey’s senior partner Laura Furstenthal defined innovation in a corporate setup:“If you look up 'innovation' in a dictionary, you see definitions like creating novel ideas or even just the word 'creativity.' We believe you have to think about the impact, so our definition of innovation incorporates delivering net new growth that is sustainable, repeatable, and substantial. You can focus on new products, markets, customers, or business models, but however you measure it, innovation has to increase value and drive growth.”As we mentioned earlier, value innovation is really important for a company’s survival. Value innovation comprises the introduction of new products and minimization of costs at the same time. Every company once started with a small setup and grew bigger with time. In McKinsey’s research on the existence of innovation “essentials,” the study focused on how competent 183 companies were at innovation. The research compared those companies with a proprietary database of economic profit, which was net profit subtracted from the cost of capital. The study revealed that companies that adopted innovation had a significant advantage over their peers. The companies with the most innovation essentials generated higher economic profit, up to 2.4 times higher than other players.Contemporary InnovationAutomotive, technology, biotechnology, and healthcare and pharmaceutical industries comprise some of the most innovative companies worldwide. Technology is a diversified segment including computer and information technology. Computer technology has evolved over the past few years and semiconductors chips are the key to the innovation of this segment, thanks to advancements in semiconductor technology. In today's world, almost everything we own and operate on a daily basis has semiconductors in it. Semiconductors have really lifted the game of processors in the computing world.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) are two of the leading semiconductor chip makers in the market. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been doing a remarkable job as the company continues to move uphill. The semiconductor company is set to announce its second quarter results on August 23. Analysts are really interested in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and have raised their targets ahead of earnings. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri lifted NVIDIA’s stock price target to $540 from $475. Similarly, Wells Fargo has also upgraded its price target to $500 from $450. Analysts are bullish on the stock and Morgan Stanley has named NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as its “top pick.” ""We think it's hard to bet against NVDA's preeminent positioning as the primary beneficiary of an AI-driven architectural data center transformation,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers in his research note. The semiconductor giant has been under the radar this year, driven by optimism around its potential for AI and demand for its components. Global firms and governments are seeking NVIDIA chips for the all-important build-up of AI software. E-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been using NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs to power Amazon Web Services. AWS and NVIDIA have been in partnership for more than 10 years and have developed solutions for virtual workstations, machine learning, high-performance computing, and IoT services. On March 21, AWS and NVIDIA joined hands to build the world's most scalable, on-demand AI system that will solve complex large language models and create generative AI applications. On May 23, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) collaborated to accelerate their AI initiatives. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will integrate NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software into its Azure Machine Learning. This will allow Azure customers to speed up their production, deployment, and management of customized applications through 100 NVIDIA AI frameworks and NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Whereas Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is keeping up with the chipmaker and is aiming to create a bigger ecosystem that is more power-efficient than Nvidia’s chip. Google has built its custom chip called the Tensor Processing Unit. The chip is handling 90% of the company's work on AI training. On April 4, Cornell University published a paper in which Google claimed to have a 1.7 times faster and 1.9 times more power-efficient system compared to Nvidia's A100 chip. These tech giants are really shaping the future and innovating technology through AI and semiconductors. The demand for semiconductors is continuing to rise and electric cars are one of the biggest semiconductor marketplaces. Electric cars are highly dependent on semiconductor chips. The innovation in semiconductor technology potentially offers longer battery life for EVs. Moreover, the chips make the EV system smarter and safer to provide risk-free rides. EVs are using AI and semiconductors simultaneously to improve the ecosystem of electric cars for their passengers. Moreover, semiconductors are also being used at the backend of systems to support the software of EVs. Elon Musk has hinted that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is highly dependent on NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. Here are some of the comments from Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Q2 2023 earnings call:“You see a lot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. I would say if they’re so great, why can’t they make a self-driving car? Because it’s harder. That’s why. So -- but I do think -- I think there’s some great AI companies out there. But just fundamentally, the staggering amount of data we’ve got to process, it’s got to be processed somehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that.So that’s what Dojo is designed to do is optimize for video training. It’s not optimized for LLMs. It’s optimized for video training. With video training, you have a much higher ratio of compute-to-memory bandwidth, so -- whereas LLMs tends to be memory bandwidth choked. So that’s it. I mean -- but like I said, we’re also -- we have some -- we’re using a lot of NVIDIA hardware. We’ll continue to -- we’ll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast as NVIDIA will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They’ve done an incredible job.And frankly, I don’t know if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can’t. So they’ve got so many customers. They’ve been kind enough to, nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders. But yes, the sheer magnitude of video training -- because like I said, we’re not trying to just get as good as human. We want to get to 10 times better than human, maybe 100 times better than human.”Whereas NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) counterpart Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is planning to reveal a new series of Radeon graphics cards. The senior vice president of AMD, Scott Herkelman in a tweet mentioned that the chip maker is set to make major announcements at Gamescom. Herkelman didn’t point out any specifics about the announcements. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su during the Q1 2023 earnings call said that they were on track to launch the GPU ramp of MI300 in Q4 2023.""And then I would say, from an overall market standpoint, I think enterprise will still be mixed with the notion that we expect some improvement. It depends a little bit on the macro situation. And then as we go into the second half of the year, in addition to Genoa, we’re also ramping Bergamo. So that’s on track to launch here in the second quarter and will ramp in the second half of the year. And then as we get towards the end of the year, we also have our GPU ramp of MI300. So with that, we start the ramp in the fourth quarter of our supercomputing wins as well as our early cloud AI wins. So those are all the factors. Of course, we’ll have to see how the the year play about how we’re positioned from an overall product and road map standpoint for Data Center.""While innovation is usually linked to technological advancements, there are companies outside of the tech sector that are and have been innovating in their respective domains for decades now. Let's take a look at some of the most innovative companies of all time.25 Most Innovative Companies of All TimeSergey Nivens/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe took the 25 companies from the most innovative companies list published by Forbes, BCG, PwC, and CEOWorld Magazine.

333,d2f9d7bd-31aa-3c70-9634-cafca6f338b8,HAS,2023-08-24,Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.70,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-nasdaq-due-pay-dividend-101545519.html,1692872145,STORY,['HAS'],"[The board of Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.70 per share on the 15th of November. This means the annual payment is 4.2% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Hasbro Hasbro Doesn't Earn Enough To Cover Its PaymentsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Hasbro isn't generating any profits, and it is paying out a very high proportion of the cash it is earning. This is quite a strong warning sign that the dividend may not be sustainable.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to grow rapidly. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we could see the payout ratio reach 126%, which is on the unsustainable side.historic-dividendHasbro Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.44, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.9% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, things aren't all that rosy. In the last five years, Hasbro's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 7.3% per annum. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Hasbro that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

I grew up around math and science because my father was a medical researcher. It was my dream to work in a lab in a white coat and publish articles in world-renowned journals.WORKFirst Job: I scooped ice cream at a local shop in high school. It was a great way for me to practice English and meet people when I first moved to the United States. More importantly, I got to enjoy free ice cream and fresh waffle cones all day long!McKinsey &amp; Company 2008-2011 - Business Analyst, Chicago, Illinois, United StatesThe Walt Disney Company 2013: Special Projects Lead at Shanghai Disneyland Resort, Shanghai, China | 2013-2014: Leadership Development Rotations at Disney Studios, Burbank, California, United States | 2014-2016: Senior Manager of Digital Products at Disney Studios, Burbank, California, United States | 2016-2018: Director of Business Development at Disney Consumer Products &amp; Interactive Media, Glendale, California, United StatesWarnerMedia 2018-2021: Vice President, Business Development, Burbank, California, United StatesKFC Global 2021-Present: Head of Channel Development &amp; Innovation, Los Angeles, California, United StatesStory continuesWhat moments, or who, in your life influenced the way you work?My Dad: While medical research may be tedious and frustrating, with long testing periods and unexpected results, my dad was (and still is at age 68) passionate about this career because advancing healthcare for our society gave meaning and fulfillment to his life. He inspired me to find my own passion and make an impact on the world with my life. He also taught me the value of strong work ethnics, patience, and humility.Moving to the United States: I had never been to a foreign country until I moved to the U.S. from China, so that journey taught me the importance of diversity and inclusivity. Being dropped into a new environment at the start of 11th grade, with only one year to get up to speed on the language, academics and extracurricular activities to be ready to apply to college was one of the biggest challenges I had encountered. It taught me that nothing is impossible as long as I have the courage to try.Becoming a Parent: Although I always wanted to be a parent, the actual event still threw my world upside down. From my older son being diagnosed with autism to working from home with two preschoolers during the pandemic, parenthood has raised my adaptiveness and resilience to a new level. My husband and I are also hugely thankful for all the help and encouragement we received from our family and community to get through the toughest times. We've learned to be more open with our struggles and vulnerabilities, and ask for help when we need it.Do you believe in work/life balance?I believe in balance and integration of family, friends, work, hobbies, learning and passions. That has never meant 9-5 or a predetermined split of time. Balance is fluid based on all the roles you are playing and needs at any given time. I do believe that it is critical to be fully present and focused wherever you are at. Time is our most precious commodity, and I value it more today than I did years ago. I make it a point to maximize every moment with my family and friends.What do people think you do versus what you actually do?My kids think I'm the keeper of the Colonel's secret recipe, and my friends think I hang out with bigshots in gaming and entertainment every day, brokering deals over cocktails. In reality, I spend most of my time connecting with internal stakeholders at Yum! and with our franchisees to understand their evolving needs and visions, develop innovation opportunities that align with their agendas and coordinate efforts across markets to maximize impact.What is the best piece of advice that you've been given?Don't be in the business of playing it safe. Be in the business of creating possibilities of greatness.How do you do it?As the saying goes, you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. I surround myself with great people who I get inspired by and learn from every day, including my family, friends, team and mentors. Once the right environment and momentum are in place, everything else will follow.Another quality I'm fortunately blessed with is optimism. While every endeavor has its smooth sail days and rocky moments, I like to emphasize the good and feel energized by what I have learned/achieved and the potential to push for more.

If you want to skip our primer on Mr. Buffett and insider trading, then jump ahead to Warren Buffett and Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks.The second quarter of 2023 has proven to be an interesting one when it comes to Warren Buffett. As his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway filed its holdings for the period with the SEC, it revealed that Mr. Buffett had shaken things up by quite a bit. During the second quarter, he reduced his investments significantly in five companies and took up new stakes in three new firms. The unfortunate firms in this list are Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). These firms saw Berkshire Hathaway reduce its investments by 71%, 61%, 45%, 40%, and 8%, respectively. Cumulatively, the reduction translated into the investment firm cutting down the stakes by roughly $6.5 billion.The new investments came in some of the biggest home building companies in America, indicating that Mr. Buffett is on board with the significant improvement in sentiment surrounding the industry this year. Home building companies are facing some interesting times since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic, which led to stay at home orders and lock downs, resulted in a large scale shift to remote working. This not only freed up office space but also increased demand for houses in suburban areas as more workers moved to the city outskirts and felt encouraged by low interest rates to buy a house. This sudden surge in demand enabled the home building companies to massively increase their margins - a strategy that benefited them in 2023. The main hurdle for home buyers this year is high interest rates, but big home builders have successfully navigated against this by reducing their margins and offering buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. Naturally, home builder stocks have soared on the market this year, and Mr. Buffett's three new investments in this category are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).Story continuesWarren Buffett's latest SEC filings show that he has invested approximately $814 million in the three home building companies and increased his investment in the financial services firm Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by $409 million. Cumulatively, this shows that he bought $1.2 billion worth of shares of four companies in Q2 2023, which is quite a bit of activity when we consider the stability of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio. This stability comes through the Oracle of Omaha's investment strategy which sees him bide his time and wait patiently before pouncing and plowing billions of dollars into the stock of companies that he deems to be suitable. For more details on Warren Buffett's investment strategy, be sure to check out Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks which is a list that includes some stocks that he has held for decades after promising that he will never sell them.Shifting gears to focus on insider trading, along with penny stock pump and dump scandals, it is one area of the stock market that has generated controversy for decades and will continue to do so. This is evident from the fact that on June 29th, 2023 alone, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI filed insider trading charges against ten people in four separate cases. According to the U.S. Attorney, the accused made more than $30 million through 'stolen' and material non public information. The latest insider trading scandals in America include one of the largest companies in the world, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). A Pfizer employee Amit Dagar knew in 2021 that the firm's Paxlovid had generated positive results in a trial for COVID treatment, and he and his associates bought and sold call options to make more than $350,000 in profits.Today, we'll look at some stocks that are favored by both Warren Buffett and insiders to see which lucky companies have seen not only the most successful investor of our time buy their shares, but also confidence from their board and investors to solicit stock purchases.

(Image: Forum Mobility)Somewhere around the middle of the Netflix movie “The Founder,” actor Michael Keaton’s Ray Kroc character is told that his franchise success turns on real estate, not flipping hamburgers.The same could be said of the nascent electric truck charging business. Every electric charging depot needs land. As part of a multiprong strategy, the biggest real estate developers and a host of well-funded startups are gobbling up acreage for future sites.The opportunity is enormous. The California Energy Commission estimates the state will need 157,000 medium- and heavy-duty truck chargers by 2030. The first target is the 30,000 drayage trucks that haul cargo to and from ports in Los Angeles, Long Beach and Oakland.California passed the Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Fleets regulations requiring a transition from diesel to electricity. Generous incentives for buying electric trucks, installing charging stations and building utility infrastructure lessen the enormous cost burden along with credits under the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard.“We will take that hodgepodge of incentives and turn it into a digestible monthly fixed fee for a trucker,” said Matt LeDucq, CEO of Fourm Mobility, a startup backed by global real estate services leader CBRE.Private and public locationsLarge fleets saw California’s rules coming. Schneider recently opened a 4.8-megawatt charging facility in El Monte, east of Los Angeles. It is capable of charging 32 Class 8 trucks at one time. NFI Industries expects to bring a similar facility online in Ontario later this year. Both facilities are private, though they received significant financial help from state and local governments.“The depot we’re building in Livermore is going to be accessible to people who don’t have land and don’t have charging infrastructure,” said LeDucq. His company is working on 10 drayage-focused charging sites across the state. “There are a lot of little fleets out there.”Story continuesForum has plenty of competition. Startup WattEV opened its first public charging depot at the Port of Long Beach in July. It expects to open three more sites before the end of the year. It offers a truck-as-a-service model, allowing drivers to use WattEV-owned trucks and charging for a single price. WattEV largely relies on grants and incentives.It recently received a $34 million federal grant through the California Transportation Commission to build and operate what is expected to be the nation’s largest electric charging depot. It would cover more than 100 acres near Sacramento International Airport on Interstate 5.WattEV opened its first public charging station for electric trucks at the Port of Long Beach in July. (Photo: WattEV)By contrast, startup infrastructure developer Voltera Inc. is backed by EQT, one of the largest and most active infrastructure investors globally. Its biggest announcement so far is cooperating with Nikola Corp. to add up to 50 Hyla hydrogen filling stations to its battery-electric charging sites.Daimler Truck North America is working with BlackRock Alternatives and NextEra Energy Resources on a $650 million electric charging plan called Greenlane. Its first site will be in Southern California followed by additional sites along various freight routes.CBRE makes EV charging a businessThe largest real estate services company in the world, CBRE sees parallels between its business and electric vehicles.“It’s akin to running a data center or running a building management system,” said Scott Howard, CBRE executive managing director and EV Solutions lead. “It’s something we’re uniquely positioned to do for the industry.”CBRE’s client roster includes office buildings, industrial and manufacturing facilities, and distribution yards. Customers began asking how to electrify their fleets before it formalized the EV Solutions business unit.“The definition of real estate is broader than just the building,” Howard said.CBRE leads a $400 million joint venture with Forum Mobility, focused on winning new customers.“We obviously have a very large and deep client roster. There’s a lot of need from them to electrify their campuses [and] their fleets,” Howard said. “The industry is just exploding.”Long relationships with utility providers is another advantage, according to Jim Hurless, CBRE global real estate lead for EV business.“We approach it together not just to solve for this one facility but understanding what CBRE’s client base is or the REITs [real estate investment trusts] and other investors and developers that we partner with. What is their strategy for the same market in the same area in the grid? We have the ability to give them a forward-looking forecast.”For Prologis, it’s about building electrificationAs of December, Prologis owned 5,495 buildings, many of them warehouses, comprising about 1.2 billion square feet in 19 countries.“By 2030, depending on the market, we’re going to see a reasonably substantial portion of those sites electrified,” said Henrik Holland, senior vice president and global head of Prologis Mobility.“We have direct access to the warehouses where our customers are charging. Charging will happen where it’s most cost effective and operationally efficient. In many cases, that’s going to be [behind the fence] at the logistics facility.Prologis has two such projects with A.B. Moeller Maerk’s Performance Team drayage operation. One is a Prologis-owned warehouse where Prologis provides the charging infrastructure to manage the Performance Team’s charging needs. At a second site, Prologis operates the infrastructure but doesn’t own the building.Such a mix of projects is how electric charging will likely develop, Holland said.Like CBRE, Prologis is tight with utilities. That doesn’t help when equipment like switchgear is in short supply. But it does allow for keeping customers informed in real time. Using zero-carbon renewable natural gas-powered mobile chargers is a stopgap while waiting for permanent infrastructure to be constructed.“We can bring that to life within a matter of weeks and run that for a period of time as we bring the next phase of service online with a utility,” he said.Portable electric chargers, like one made by Lightning eMotors, are a stopgap while waiting for permanent electric charging infrastructure. (Photo: Alan Adler/FreightWaves)Reaching across Interstate 10Another well-funded startup, Terawatt Infrastructure, has used some of its billion-dollar-plus backing to acquire land to develop charging sites west to east along Interstate 10 from California to El Paso, Texas..Since a large site acquisition in California could run $30 million-$40 million, a billion bucks “can go quickly, especially considering the demand,” Terawatt CEO Neha Palmer said.When she worked at Google acquiring sites for data centers, Palmer had a 50-mile radius to work with in choosing a site.“Here, it’s hyperlocal,” she said. “We want to make sure these charging locations are in places where it’s not going to disrupt operations. That’s either on the customer site or, if there’s not space, we have to find a site that’s close to them.”That location has to have access to lots of power. Not every address does.“In a place like California, there’s more congested regions and places where you might have more power,” Palmer said. “These are the kinds of site selection criteria we’re having to deploy as we think about large-scale EV charging for customers.”Utilities take the long view — literally 25 years — when creating an integrated resource plan. Power companies consider more than vehicle charging. But they also keep five-year time horizons that consider future loads like the demand from EVs.Related articles:WattEV opens public truck charging depot in Long Beach portMegawatt charging for electric trucks arriving in small loadsForum Mobility in $400M JV for electric truck infrastructureClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Real estate investors surge into electric truck charging appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

See our latest analysis for Newell Brands Is Newell Brands Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Newell Brands today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $12.55, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Furthermore, Newell Brands’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.What does the future of Newell Brands look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted revenue growth of 1.4% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Newell Brands, at least in the short term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NWL’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NWL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The number of package flights operated by FedEx Express and UPS significantly declined month over month in July, underscoring how far the overall air cargo market has sunk since the spring of 2022 and the effect of efficiency initiatives the companies have undertaken in response to lower express volumes.FedEx (NYSE: FDX) flew 9% fewer domestic flights last month than in June following small sequential gains the prior two months, with year-over-year flight activity down 14%, according to an analysis by investment bank Morgan Stanley. The year-over-year decline in UPS’ flight activity accelerated to 13% from 10% in June. UPS (NYSE: UPS) reduced July flights by 14% from June. Flight activity in May and June, by comparison, was relatively stable.Morgan Stanley only tracks domestic flights for express carriers, but they have also cut back flight activity on international routes during the past year to save money.Express air, part of the integrated logistics service both companies provide, underperformed typical seasonal declines, with UPS seeing the second consecutive month of declines worse than seasonality.FedEx and UPS have previously declared they are reducing flight activity to match lower volumes in parcel shipments, while FedEx is also streamlining its air infrastructure as part of a multiyear effort to take out structural costs and improve profit margins.FedEx in June said it plans to remove 29 aircraft from its fleet this fiscal year through permanent retirement and temporary storage. It retired 18 older aircraft during the fiscal year ended May 30 and reduced global flight hours by 12% during the final quarter.UPS reported second-quarter domestic next-day air revenue fell 9.4% on a 12% drop in volume. Management attributed a large chunk of the domestic decline to customers trading down to UPS’ lower-cost ground network. The airline pulled more shipments into its WorldPort hub in Louisville, Kentucky, to help fill up next-day flights and reduce use of second-day flights, resulting in domestic flight hours that were 6.5% lower versus last year, said CFO Brian Newman.Story continuesUPS also experienced a large amount of freight diversion to competitors during the summer because customers were worried about a looming strike by delivery drivers and warehouse workers. The Teamsters union on Tuesday ratified a new five-year contract.UPS’ international volume slipped 6.6% during the quarter. The company said a reduction in aircraft block hours significantly contributed to a $343 million decrease in operating expenses for the international air and ground network.The express carriers’ reduced flight activity is a manifestation of the wider freight recession gripping the broader air cargo market since last year. Data from Cirium Ascend consultancy shows total freighter hours in July fell 7% year over year. BMO Capital Markets calculated that dedicated freighters flew 5.7% fewer hours in July than a year earlier.The Morgan Stanley figures also show the difference in performance at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which has slowed its private cargo airline’s torrid pace of growth but hasn’t made any large-scale adjustments to the fleet. Flight activity at Amazon Air dipped 2% month over month in July after being flat in June. Compared to last year, Amazon’s flight count actually increased 16%, three points better than in June.Amazon’s year-over-year flight growth in July was the highest since February 2022. The flight performance aligns with an 11% increase in Amazon’s North American retail sales during the second quarter and a record Prime Day last month.Sun Country Airlines, which operates Boeing 737-800 converted freighters for Amazon, said it flew more hours during the second quarter than a year earlier. Meanwhile, Cargojet said its Amazon business in Canada has ticked up recently, justifying the addition of an extra flight and the opening of a new base at Vancouver airport.Amazon has surgically trimmed a handful of flights operated by contract carriers. The retailer parted ways this summer with Silver Airways, a small airline that flew turboprop aircraft on short hops from Amazon’s regional hub in Fort Worth, Texas, that likely were replaced by cheaper truck transport. It also dialed back on flights operated by ASL Airlines in Europe and returned a few aging Boeing 767-200 freighters with expiring leases.More FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.WHAT ELSE TO READ:Wait for airfreight recovery could extend deep into 2024The post FedEx, UPS pull back July cargo flights amid weak volumes appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

We remind investors that the tentative agreement between Teamsters and UPS was reached in July 2023.Evidently, Teamsters represents 34,000 pilots of UPS, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). In the ratification process, 86% of voting members cast their votes in favor of the deal. The voting procedure (electronic) started on Aug 3 and concluded on Aug 22.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This deal approval has averted the possibility of a strike by the workers. If a strike had materialized, operations of this parcel-delivery giant would have been severely crippled. This would also have worsened the supply-chain scenario in the United States. A strike, in all probability, would have resulted in delayed deliveries during Christmas apart from causing escalation in shipping costs.This ratification enables the current full-and-part-time employees at UPS, represented by the union, to receive a $2.75 per hour pay increase in 2023. It also makes them eligible to get $7.50 more per hour over the length of the contract, which is five years. The deal has also done away with the contentious two-tier wage system for drivers.Further, the deal includes provisions aimed at improving workers’ quality of life. To this end, the labor deal, worth $30 billion, has secured additional paid holiday, and safety and health protections for workers like air conditioning in vehicles and cargo ventilation. All local supplemental agreements, barring one, have also been ratified. The new deal will take effect as soon as the remaining supplemental agreement is renegotiated and finalized.In fact, new labor deals are in vogue these days in the transportation space. With companies struggling with labor shortage, the bargaining power of various labor groups has naturally increased.Story continuesRecently, American Airlines’ AAL pilots ratified a $9.6 billion contract, which boosts the overall compensation of AAL pilots by more than 46% over its duration of four years.

Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan outlines the wage increases and benefits stipulated in the new contract and comments made by Teamsters leadership.Video Transcript- UPS workers have officially voted yes to a new labor deal that follows the largest single strike against a company in US history. The agreement spans five years and lifts wages for warehouse and delivery workers. Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan joins us now with the BreakdownAlexis, we knew that there was an agreement in principle, but this is the ratification of that. Talk us through the significance here.ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, [? Julie. ?] So this is really making this agreement between the Teamsters and UPS management official. It was reached in July but the agreement, it got about 86-- a little over 86% support from these Teamsters UPS workers. That's approximately 300,000 full and part-time drivers and warehouse workers.And the contract, it's not fully ratified yet. There are 175 Teamsters workers, UPS workers in Florida who voted no to a supplement, and so the parties still need to work out those kind of minor features as of yet. But it is expected that this will get the full vote and it will become this five-year agreement in place.But when the agreement does get fully ratified, these union workers will see major wage increases and also some new benefits, like an added vacation day and an end to mandatory overtime, which had been a sticking point for these workers.Now, let's take a look more closely, you just had them up on the screen there, at those wage increases. By the end of this contract, the veteran full time workers, they're going to earn an average of $49 an hour plus benefits. That's about $102 a year-- $102,000 a year in salary, up from an average of $42 an hour plus benefits.And as for the part-time workers, they're going to get an immediate boost to at least $21 an hour plus benefits. So that's a boost up from $17 an hour plus benefits. And by the end of the contract, those part-time base pay, their work pay will be about $25.75 an hour. So the increases go over time here.Story continuesNow, just two weeks ago, UPS had cited these new labor costs. When it reported its second-quarter earnings, the company reported a sharp drop in revenue as well as profits for the quarter. Package volumes for the quarter down 10% for that time period. And now, you have these added labor costs. And so UPS, with those two things, had decreased its revenue outlook for the year.So certainly, this will weigh heavily on the company as it kind of tries to adjust here to these really sweeping changes in what it's going to have to pay in order to get these packages across the country and across the globe.- And, Alexis, the Teamsters' relatively new President Sean O'Brien, he's been outspoken about the importance of the agreement. What's his message?ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, so he described this agreement as a template for how workers should be paid and protected across the country. He added that the non-union shops, and he points out Amazon frequently, he said that Amazon better pay attention to this deal. Now, Amazon, for its part, it just relaunched its in-house Amazon shipping ground service for its amazon.com sellers.But certainly, the Teamsters have had their eyes, and particularly Sean O'Brien, the president, has had his eyes on Amazon. Now, Amazon uses third-party services for its delivery drivers, but this is definitely a target that they should be expecting to be coming from the Teamsters.- Yahoo Finance's own Alexis Keenan. Excellent breakdown there, Alexis. Appreciate it.]"
347,c39155a4-eab4-3381-a42d-c742216b2dc9,UPS,2023-08-24,"United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-ups-trending-130006092.html,1692795606,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this package delivery service have returned -9.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.1% change. The Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, to which UPS belongs, has lost 7.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.25 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -24.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -24.6%. This estimate has changed -8.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.53 indicates a change of +7.9% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UPS, the consensus sales estimate of $22.37 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -7.4%. The $93.47 billion and $97.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -6.9% and +4.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $22.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11%. EPS of $2.54 for the same period compares with $3.29 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.61%. The EPS surprise was +1.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our primer on Mr. Buffett and insider trading, then jump ahead to Warren Buffett and Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks.The second quarter of 2023 has proven to be an interesting one when it comes to Warren Buffett. As his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway filed its holdings for the period with the SEC, it revealed that Mr. Buffett had shaken things up by quite a bit. During the second quarter, he reduced his investments significantly in five companies and took up new stakes in three new firms. The unfortunate firms in this list are Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). These firms saw Berkshire Hathaway reduce its investments by 71%, 61%, 45%, 40%, and 8%, respectively. Cumulatively, the reduction translated into the investment firm cutting down the stakes by roughly $6.5 billion.The new investments came in some of the biggest home building companies in America, indicating that Mr. Buffett is on board with the significant improvement in sentiment surrounding the industry this year. Home building companies are facing some interesting times since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic, which led to stay at home orders and lock downs, resulted in a large scale shift to remote working. This not only freed up office space but also increased demand for houses in suburban areas as more workers moved to the city outskirts and felt encouraged by low interest rates to buy a house. This sudden surge in demand enabled the home building companies to massively increase their margins - a strategy that benefited them in 2023. The main hurdle for home buyers this year is high interest rates, but big home builders have successfully navigated against this by reducing their margins and offering buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. Naturally, home builder stocks have soared on the market this year, and Mr. Buffett's three new investments in this category are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).Story continuesWarren Buffett's latest SEC filings show that he has invested approximately $814 million in the three home building companies and increased his investment in the financial services firm Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by $409 million. Cumulatively, this shows that he bought $1.2 billion worth of shares of four companies in Q2 2023, which is quite a bit of activity when we consider the stability of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio. This stability comes through the Oracle of Omaha's investment strategy which sees him bide his time and wait patiently before pouncing and plowing billions of dollars into the stock of companies that he deems to be suitable.

This is evident from the fact that on June 29th, 2023 alone, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI filed insider trading charges against ten people in four separate cases. According to the U.S. Attorney, the accused made more than $30 million through 'stolen' and material non public information. The latest insider trading scandals in America include one of the largest companies in the world, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). A Pfizer employee Amit Dagar knew in 2021 that the firm's Paxlovid had generated positive results in a trial for COVID treatment, and he and his associates bought and sold call options to make more than $350,000 in profits.Today, we'll look at some stocks that are favored by both Warren Buffett and insiders to see which lucky companies have seen not only the most successful investor of our time buy their shares, but also confidence from their board and investors to solicit stock purchases.

NetApp makes additional adjustments to the non-GAAP tax provision for certain tax matters as described below. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP results can be found at http://investors.netapp.com. NetApp’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes that the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance.5GAAP net income per share and non-GAAP net income per share are calculated using the diluted number of shares.NetApp usage of non-GAAP financial informationTo supplement NetApp’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), NetApp provides investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow, billings, and historical and projected non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. NetApp also presents the hardware and software components of our GAAP product revenues. Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP measures. The hardware and software components of our product revenues are derived from an estimated fair value allocation of the transaction price of our contracts with customers, down to the level of the product hardware and software components. This allocation is primarily based on the contractual prices at which NetApp has historically billed customers for such respective components.NetApp believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rates, and non-GAAP earnings per share data, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.NetApp believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which it defines as the net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in its business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on its common stock. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.NetApp believes that the presentation of the software and hardware components of our product revenues is meaningful to investors and management as it illustrates the significance of the Company’s software and provides improved visibility into the value created by our software innovation and R&amp;D investment.NetApp approximates billings by adding net revenues as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period to the change in total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the same period. Billings is a performance measure that NetApp believes provides useful information to management and investors because it approximates the amounts under purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed.NetApp’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors’ operating results and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making.NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures when applicable:A. Amortization of intangible assets. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.B. Stock-based compensation expenses. NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the amount can fluctuate based on variables unrelated to the performance of the underlying business. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period.C. Litigation settlements. NetApp may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. NetApp excludes these charges and benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results.D. Acquisition-related expenses. NetApp excludes acquisition-related expenses, including (a) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges and (b) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are not related to our ongoing business or cost base and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.E. Restructuring charges. These charges consist of restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.F. Asset impairments. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.G. Gains/losses on the sale or derecognition of assets. These are gains/losses from the sale of our properties and other transactions in which we transfer control of assets to a third party. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.H. Gains/losses on the sale of investments in equity securities. These are gains/losses from the sale of our investment in certain equity securities. Typically, such investments are sold as a result of a change in control of the underlying businesses. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.I. Debt extinguishment costs. NetApp excludes certain non-recurring expenses incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of debt. Management believes such nonrecurring costs do not reflect the results of its underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.J. Income tax adjustments. NetApp’s non-GAAP tax provision is based upon a projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The non-GAAP tax provision also excludes, when applicable, (a) tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal periods that are a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, authoritative guidance, income tax audit settlements, statute lapses and/or court decisions, (b) tax charges or benefits that are attributable to unusual or non-recurring book and/or tax accounting method changes, (c) tax charges that are a result of a non-routine foreign cash repatriation, (d) tax charges or benefits that are a result of infrequent restructuring of the Company’s tax structure, (e) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in valuation allowance, and (f) tax charges or benefits resulting from the integration of intellectual property from acquisitions. Management believes that the use of non-GAAP tax provisions provides a more meaningful measure of the Company’s operational performance.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NetApp believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. NetApp management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and projected results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures.Constant CurrencyIn periods in which the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes are significant, NetApp presents certain constant currency growth rates or quantifies the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on year-over-year fluctuations, including for net revenues, billings, and earnings. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results.About NetAppNetApp is a global, cloud-led, data-centric software company that empowers organizations to lead with data in the age of accelerated digital transformation.

If you want to skip our analysis of what's been happening in the candy market over the past year, head on to 5 Most Consumed Candies in the US.According to a report by Grand View Research, the United States confectionery market is currently valued at $38.17 billion in 2022. The candy market in the United States is expected to grow to $55.35 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8%.The report suggests that the growing demand for sugar-free options, rising awareness of the health benefits of chocolate, and increased living standards across the United States are primary drivers of the boom in the confectionery industry. On January 25, Forbes shared its analysis of the obesity pandemic in the United States. 19 states in the United States had an obesity rate of over 35%. According to the report, more than 2 in 5 adults and 1 in 5 children are obese in the United States. Also, check out the 20 most obese states in America in 2023. Such, eventually pushes the country to choose healthier food options, contributing to the growing demand for sugar-free candies and dark chocolate.According to the report by Grand View Research, the chocolate confectionary industry held the largest market share, followed by the sugar confectionary industry, with a 45% and 30% market share in 2022, respectively. The popularity of candies is also derived from events and holidays in the United States, such as Halloween, Valentine's Day, and Easter. The glitz and glamor of these holidays are backed by the widespread availability of candies in different shapes and sizes. However, the rising cocoa prices and sugar shortage may cause alarm for candy companies ahead of Halloween.On July 22, The Wall Street Journal addressed the likely hit to the candy industry due to a country-wide sugar shortage. The report suggests that the sugar shortage stems from various reasons, including a decline in sugar beet production in the Midwest, increased demand for sugar from other industries, and tariffs imposed on imported sugar. Inevitably, the shortage of sugar will push the price of sugar, suggesting an extra cost of $1 billion to candy makers across the country. As per the report, the sugar shortage is expected to last until 2023. You can also check out some of the other worst-performing commodities in 2023.Story continuesOn August 18, Reuters reported the ordeal faced by chocolate makers as cocoa prices hit an all-time high in 46 years. The decline in cocoa production in West Africa and increased demand for Cocoa from China and India have disrupted the demand-supply equilibrium in the United States, eventually pushing the prices of cocoa. According to the report, cocoa prices have increased by 50% over the past year.While rising cocoa prices may concern chocolate makers, does the same apply to consumers? On July 10, Bloomberg reported that the purchase of chocolate confectioneries is expected to rise to $26 billion, a 5.8% increase compared to the previous year. The report suggests that the rising demand may prevent candy makers from suffering explicable losses before Halloween.Candy Companies in the United StatesSome of the major players in the United States include The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), The Simply Good Foods Company (NASDAQ:SMPL), and Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc.

But not anymore. Goldman Sachs Managing Director Jason English explains that millennials, who are now the ones forming households, don't share that same stigma. English, who covers consumer staples stocks, says it presents a problem for companies who bank on having well-known brands.When it comes to his coverage, English is not favoring General Mills (GIS), Campbell Soup (CPB), or J.M. Smucker (SJM), because they have ""underperformed"" and ""their businesses are really going to be challenged."" As for stocks he likes, ""we want more global-facing businesses,"" English says, highlighting Mondelez (MDLZ) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL). English also likes BellRing Brands (BRBR) saying the company is ""absolutely on fire.""Video Transcript- Jason how is all of this feeding through into store or generic brands? Are we seeing that trade-down effect?JASON ENGLISH: We are seeing it, Julie. And we can debate, is this a sign of overall consumer weakness or is this a sign of a secular trend that was in place before COVID? I would argue it's the latter. I grew up and my generation grew up in an era where private label was kind of cheap knockoff product.The younger generation, the millennial generation, is now forming households and pushing the largest basket down the grocery aisle grew up in a very different environment, where private label doesn't have the same stigma. Meanwhile, retailers have really made it a priority to push their own brands to engender loyalty within the store.Those dynamics were disrupted during COVID primarily because of supply. Those disruptions are behind us and we're now seeing once again the secular trend of the rise of store brands or retailers own brands or private label, whatever you want to call it, that trend is back and it's back and forth, which makes it even harder.If you're one of these branded guys operating in the center store, the consumption is shrinking there. Consumers. are sharing stomach to perimeter fresh, real foods. And then within those categories, you're losing share to the retail brands. It has a compounding effect that makes the businesses even more challenging.Story continues- And so Jason, we've been looking through of course, your coverage list just to see where you're a little bit more bullish. And perhaps on the other end of that spectrum, very bearish. So what are some of your top picks as of right now as you look across the environment, think about what we've seen from the consumer over the course of back-to-school season, and even what that's projected to look like as we get into the holiday season?JASON ENGLISH: Yeah, good question. So you mentioned I've got a bearish bent. I probably have more celebrating to find with most sell side analysts out there. So we have a lot of conviction in some of our sells that are suffering from all these dynamics they talked about, particularly US-centric centers for food companies like General Mills, like Campbell's Soup, like Smucker's, they've underperformed. I think their businesses are really going to be challenged. I see no catalysts for relative rerating or outperformance going forward. So we remain very comfortable there.On the flip side, we want more global-facing businesses. Emerging market consumer is holding up really well, especially in Latin America. Pockets of Southeast Asia, there's real growth there. So I want some more global reaching companies who can tap into that growth I'm going to lean into Mondelez, the snack food, the maker of Oreo, Cadbury, et cetera, really thriving in this environment. And I expect it to continue to thrive.And on the personal care side of my coverage universe, we're going to lean into Colgate at least amongst our large-cap. We got some nice small-cap names to mid-cap names with some really good product cycles. One in particular would be BellRing Brands, where they make protein shakes after nutrition. It's absolutely on fire, more capacity, costs relief on the comp.So I've got names I like but at the same time, the other side, I got some companies with some real pressures that I would look to avoid.]"

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:23% = US$6.8b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 23% ROETo begin with, Occidental Petroleum has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 28% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 24% net income growth seen by Occidental Petroleum was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 28% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is OXY worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether OXY is currently mispriced by the market.Is Occidental Petroleum Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Occidental Petroleum's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 1.9%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 98% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 18% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 16%) over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Occidental Petroleum's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

If you want to skip our primer on Mr. Buffett and insider trading, then jump ahead to Warren Buffett and Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks.The second quarter of 2023 has proven to be an interesting one when it comes to Warren Buffett. As his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway filed its holdings for the period with the SEC, it revealed that Mr. Buffett had shaken things up by quite a bit. During the second quarter, he reduced his investments significantly in five companies and took up new stakes in three new firms. The unfortunate firms in this list are Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). These firms saw Berkshire Hathaway reduce its investments by 71%, 61%, 45%, 40%, and 8%, respectively. Cumulatively, the reduction translated into the investment firm cutting down the stakes by roughly $6.5 billion.The new investments came in some of the biggest home building companies in America, indicating that Mr. Buffett is on board with the significant improvement in sentiment surrounding the industry this year. Home building companies are facing some interesting times since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic, which led to stay at home orders and lock downs, resulted in a large scale shift to remote working. This not only freed up office space but also increased demand for houses in suburban areas as more workers moved to the city outskirts and felt encouraged by low interest rates to buy a house. This sudden surge in demand enabled the home building companies to massively increase their margins - a strategy that benefited them in 2023. The main hurdle for home buyers this year is high interest rates, but big home builders have successfully navigated against this by reducing their margins and offering buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. Naturally, home builder stocks have soared on the market this year, and Mr. Buffett's three new investments in this category are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).Story continuesWarren Buffett's latest SEC filings show that he has invested approximately $814 million in the three home building companies and increased his investment in the financial services firm Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by $409 million. Cumulatively, this shows that he bought $1.2 billion worth of shares of four companies in Q2 2023, which is quite a bit of activity when we consider the stability of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio. This stability comes through the Oracle of Omaha's investment strategy which sees him bide his time and wait patiently before pouncing and plowing billions of dollars into the stock of companies that he deems to be suitable.

This is evident from the fact that on June 29th, 2023 alone, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI filed insider trading charges against ten people in four separate cases. According to the U.S. Attorney, the accused made more than $30 million through 'stolen' and material non public information. The latest insider trading scandals in America include one of the largest companies in the world, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). A Pfizer employee Amit Dagar knew in 2021 that the firm's Paxlovid had generated positive results in a trial for COVID treatment, and he and his associates bought and sold call options to make more than $350,000 in profits.Today, we'll look at some stocks that are favored by both Warren Buffett and insiders to see which lucky companies have seen not only the most successful investor of our time buy their shares, but also confidence from their board and investors to solicit stock purchases. Some notable names on this list are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP).Warren Buffett and Insiders Love These StocksOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the stocks that both insiders and Warren Buffett are buying, we scanned Berkshire Hathaway's second quarter of 2023 investment portfolio and checked each of the 46 company stocks in it with Insider Monkey's insider trading tracker to see which firms have seen insider purchases.

The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at 5.89. This analysis seeks to answer the question: is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) modestly overvalued? The valuation analysis that follows will provide insights into this question.Company IntroductionOXY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of OXYOccidental Petroleum is an independent exploration and production company with operations in the United States, Latin America, and the Middle East. It reported net proved reserves of 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2022. The company's net production averaged 1,159 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022 at a ratio of 75% oil and natural gas liquids and 25% natural gas. The stock's current price is $61.39, while its GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $50.51. This suggests that the stock is modestly overvalued.Is Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Modestly Overvalued?Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.Our analysis suggests that Occidental Petroleum is modestly overvalued. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. As the stock's share price of $61.39 is significantly above the GF Value Line, it suggests that the stock may be overvalued and its future returns could be poor. This could potentially impact the long-term return of its stock, which is likely to be lower than its business growth.Story continuesIs Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Modestly Overvalued?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Hence, a careful review of a company's financial strength is crucial before deciding to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Occidental Petroleum has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.02, which ranks worse than 91.94% of 1018 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. GuruFocus ranks Occidental Petroleum's financial strength as 5 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Is Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Modestly Overvalued?Profitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Occidental Petroleum has been profitable 6 times over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $31.50 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.89. Its operating margin is 29.55%, which ranks better than 73.45% of 968 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, the profitability of Occidental Petroleum is ranked 7 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is a critical factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Occidental Petroleum's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 54.51% of 853 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 33.1%, which ranks better than 71.55% of 826 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, the return on invested capital should be higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, Occidental Petroleum's return on invested capital is 10.98, and its cost of capital is 9.12.Is Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Modestly Overvalued?ConclusionIn summary, the stock of Occidental Petroleum is estimated to be modestly overvalued.

If you want to skip our primer on Mr. Buffett and insider trading, then jump ahead to Warren Buffett and Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks.The second quarter of 2023 has proven to be an interesting one when it comes to Warren Buffett. As his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway filed its holdings for the period with the SEC, it revealed that Mr. Buffett had shaken things up by quite a bit. During the second quarter, he reduced his investments significantly in five companies and took up new stakes in three new firms. The unfortunate firms in this list are Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). These firms saw Berkshire Hathaway reduce its investments by 71%, 61%, 45%, 40%, and 8%, respectively. Cumulatively, the reduction translated into the investment firm cutting down the stakes by roughly $6.5 billion.The new investments came in some of the biggest home building companies in America, indicating that Mr. Buffett is on board with the significant improvement in sentiment surrounding the industry this year. Home building companies are facing some interesting times since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic, which led to stay at home orders and lock downs, resulted in a large scale shift to remote working. This not only freed up office space but also increased demand for houses in suburban areas as more workers moved to the city outskirts and felt encouraged by low interest rates to buy a house. This sudden surge in demand enabled the home building companies to massively increase their margins - a strategy that benefited them in 2023. The main hurdle for home buyers this year is high interest rates, but big home builders have successfully navigated against this by reducing their margins and offering buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. Naturally, home builder stocks have soared on the market this year, and Mr. Buffett's three new investments in this category are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).Story continuesWarren Buffett's latest SEC filings show that he has invested approximately $814 million in the three home building companies and increased his investment in the financial services firm Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by $409 million. Cumulatively, this shows that he bought $1.2 billion worth of shares of four companies in Q2 2023, which is quite a bit of activity when we consider the stability of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio. This stability comes through the Oracle of Omaha's investment strategy which sees him bide his time and wait patiently before pouncing and plowing billions of dollars into the stock of companies that he deems to be suitable.

This is evident from the fact that on June 29th, 2023 alone, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI filed insider trading charges against ten people in four separate cases. According to the U.S. Attorney, the accused made more than $30 million through 'stolen' and material non public information. The latest insider trading scandals in America include one of the largest companies in the world, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). A Pfizer employee Amit Dagar knew in 2021 that the firm's Paxlovid had generated positive results in a trial for COVID treatment, and he and his associates bought and sold call options to make more than $350,000 in profits.Today, we'll look at some stocks that are favored by both Warren Buffett and insiders to see which lucky companies have seen not only the most successful investor of our time buy their shares, but also confidence from their board and investors to solicit stock purchases.

The McLean, Virginia-based financial giant is sprucing up its network of 50 branch-café locations spanning 18 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., giving each one a new look with menu items targeting younger consumers.Capital One is replacing longtime supplier Peet's Coffee with new food and beverage options from Santa Cruz, California-based Verve Coffee Roasters and introducing new menu items like avocado toast and ice cream geared to appeal to under-40 adults.Coffee drinks still dominate the Capital One café menu, and Capital One credit and debit card customers still get 50% off any hand-crafted beverage. But along with different food items, the facelift brings new drinks including cider and kombucha, which are now on offer at a revamped location that opened this week in Scottsdale, Arizona.The $468 billion-asset Capital One recently launched a video touting the change, but the company did not respond by deadline for comment, nor did representatives from Verve. A Peet's spokesperson declined to comment on the change. The transition reportedly will be completed by the end of the year. A sign advertising a discount for Capital One cardholders at the bank's café in Scottsdale, Arizona. Credit: Kate FitzgeraldCapital One inherited its first few bank-office cafés when it acquired ING Direct for $9 billion, and in recent years the financial giant steadily tweaked and expanded the concept to encompass brightly lit cafés with charging stations, WiFi and plenty of space for people to sit, visit or work in urban and shopping-mall zones with high foot-traffic.Capital One isn't the only bank making room for coffee in its branches. Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp received permission from the City of Scottsdale this month to build a bank branch with café space 11 miles away from Arizona's only Capital One café.Story continuesA U.S. Bank spokesperson said the $680 billion-asset bank has incorporated a self-serve coffee bar/café area into its newer branch designs, but the firm has no plans to bring baristas into branches.Santander opened one of its five global Santander Bank Work cafés in Brooklyn in 2020. The Spanish bank described the location as an ""innovation hub"" for entrepreneurs and community members with meeting spaces. It provides coffee and food from a third party, and Santander credit or debit card customers get a 30% discount on beverages.Many other banks have informal coffee bars and space for customers who want to sit down and relax in the branch, said Stewart Watterson, a strategic analyst with Datos Insights.""I believe what we're seeing is a more concerted effort to transform bank branches' purpose,"" Watterson said, noting that banks are using branch amenities to encourage new-customer walk-ins while directing existing customers and those who want streamlined service to digital channels.Most research suggests that younger adults prefer to open accounts through digital channels and most don't want to visit branches. But other data suggests that millennials and Gen Z consumers up to age 24 prefer visiting branches to learn about products, according to Watterson.""Some financial institutions are transforming branches from transaction-processing centers to places where a 20-something would want to hang out, and coffee makes a natural addition,"" he said.After a two-day closure for remodeling, customers lined up to try the new menu at the revamped Capital One café in Scottsdale.A mix of young adults and a few baby boomer-age consumers used Capital One café's seating and free office space. Some chatted with Capital One employees who carry small tablets and laptops around the café to answer potential customers' questions or guide them to the two ATMs located in the café. ]"

""So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.""A similar warning came this month from the world's largest retailer, Walmart.""Jobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers. But rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs and tightening lending standards, and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told Wall Street when the retailer reported earnings.Federal student loans will begin to accrue interest again on Sept. 1, with payments resuming on Oct. 1.Read more: Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could helpTransUnion's head of global research and consulting Charlie Wise tells Yahoo Finance that roughly 40 million consumers will face the ""payment shock"" when student debt relief ends.A man carries flowers and balloons during Los Angeles Mission College's 48th annual commencement ceremony on June 6, 2023. (Hans Gutknecht/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images via Getty Images)Consumers were already having trouble paying off credit card debt, as Macy's warned this week. Now, the return of student loan payments could make financial matters worse, with execs warning that the extra expense may lead consumers to pull back spending in other areas.Yahoo Finance takes a look at the consumer stocks with the most at risk.Retailers with most student loan payment exposureSome retailers appear more vulnerable to repayment shock than others heading into the crucial back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.Story continues""We are most cautious on brands with high exposure to student debt holders and inferior value perceptions amongst 18-34-year-olds, the most representative demographic of student debt holders,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients.The research team at TD Cowen highlighted Target (TGT) and Ulta (ULTA) as particularly vulnerable, due to their exposure to younger, low-income consumers with student loans.""The resumption of student loan repayments is one of many factors that we're watching really closely,"" Target CFO Michael Fiddelke told Yahoo Finance as the retailer slashed its full-year profit outlook.Other ""most-exposed"" stocks to younger, lower-income student borrowers, according to TD Cowen analysts, include Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), FIGS (FIGS), Foot Locker (FL), Burlington Stores (BURL), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote that US student debt borrowers will likely pull back spending on apparel overall since they ""prefer brands over private label and specialty retailers over discounters.""This is bad news for American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Carter's (CRI), Crocs (CROX), Canada Goose (GOOS), The Gap (GPS), Nordstrom (JWN), Nike (NKE), Steven Madden (SHOO), Under Armour (UAA), and Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. (VSCO), Sole said.Stores with a higher discretionary product mix also face higher risk, according to JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers.That includes Target and Ulta, Horvers noted, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Best Buy (BBY), followed by Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Costco (COST), and Walmart, with the primary difference driven by the former group's higher mix of discretionary product.On the flip side, auto parts stocks are less at risk ""given their lower-income exposure and low discretionary mix,"" Horvers wrote in a note to investors.Meanwhile, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) ""remains a question mark"" as its ""geo-weighted exposure to student loans ranks it high offset by its largely non-discretionary mix (85% grocery),"" Horvers added.Restaurants watch for sales weaknessWhen it comes to spending at restaurants, TD Cowen's Charles said he estimates up to ""a 2% annual headwind to restaurant industry spending as student loan payments resume.""The team at TD Cowen suggested Jack in the Box (JACK), Dutch Bros (BROS), and Sweetgreen (SG) may face headwinds. Investors should also tread lightly with tobacco and beverage brands, such as Altria Group (MO), British American Tobacco (BATS), and Monster Beverage (MNST).Even higher-end plays in the restaurant space aren't immune.Cava — where a salad bowl can set one back $14 — expressed caution on the consumer outlook in its latest earnings.CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance that student loan payments restarting was one of the ""multitude of factors"" up against consumers, along with higher gas prices, costly utility bills, and a ""hawkish Fed.""""So we're mindful of those pressures,"" Schulman said. ""We saw a resilient consumer in Q2, but we'd be remiss if we didn't take those considerations into account.""Of course, not all borrowers will have to pay right away.Those still in school remain ""in the regular forbearance period,"" TransUnion's Wise points out. ""But we think that about 26 million-27 million consumers will be facing the beginning or resumption of payments in the next couple of weeks.""There's another catch: The Department of Education is instituting a 12-month ""on-ramp"" for repayment from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024. Though interest will accrue during this period, financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments won't be considered delinquent or reported to credit bureaus and debt collectors.Cowen's Charles said in a note to clients this ""likely pushes any major impact to spending to late next year.""Are you an American with student loan debt or a company nervous about the return of student loan payments?

If you want to skip our primer on Mr. Buffett and insider trading, then jump ahead to Warren Buffett and Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks.The second quarter of 2023 has proven to be an interesting one when it comes to Warren Buffett. As his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway filed its holdings for the period with the SEC, it revealed that Mr. Buffett had shaken things up by quite a bit. During the second quarter, he reduced his investments significantly in five companies and took up new stakes in three new firms. The unfortunate firms in this list are Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). These firms saw Berkshire Hathaway reduce its investments by 71%, 61%, 45%, 40%, and 8%, respectively. Cumulatively, the reduction translated into the investment firm cutting down the stakes by roughly $6.5 billion.The new investments came in some of the biggest home building companies in America, indicating that Mr. Buffett is on board with the significant improvement in sentiment surrounding the industry this year. Home building companies are facing some interesting times since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic, which led to stay at home orders and lock downs, resulted in a large scale shift to remote working. This not only freed up office space but also increased demand for houses in suburban areas as more workers moved to the city outskirts and felt encouraged by low interest rates to buy a house. This sudden surge in demand enabled the home building companies to massively increase their margins - a strategy that benefited them in 2023. The main hurdle for home buyers this year is high interest rates, but big home builders have successfully navigated against this by reducing their margins and offering buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. Naturally, home builder stocks have soared on the market this year, and Mr. Buffett's three new investments in this category are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).Story continuesWarren Buffett's latest SEC filings show that he has invested approximately $814 million in the three home building companies and increased his investment in the financial services firm Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by $409 million. Cumulatively, this shows that he bought $1.2 billion worth of shares of four companies in Q2 2023, which is quite a bit of activity when we consider the stability of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio. This stability comes through the Oracle of Omaha's investment strategy which sees him bide his time and wait patiently before pouncing and plowing billions of dollars into the stock of companies that he deems to be suitable. For more details on Warren Buffett's investment strategy, be sure to check out Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks which is a list that includes some stocks that he has held for decades after promising that he will never sell them.Shifting gears to focus on insider trading, along with penny stock pump and dump scandals, it is one area of the stock market that has generated controversy for decades and will continue to do so. This is evident from the fact that on June 29th, 2023 alone, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI filed insider trading charges against ten people in four separate cases. According to the U.S. Attorney, the accused made more than $30 million through 'stolen' and material non public information. The latest insider trading scandals in America include one of the largest companies in the world, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). A Pfizer employee Amit Dagar knew in 2021 that the firm's Paxlovid had generated positive results in a trial for COVID treatment, and he and his associates bought and sold call options to make more than $350,000 in profits.Today, we'll look at some stocks that are favored by both Warren Buffett and insiders to see which lucky companies have seen not only the most successful investor of our time buy their shares, but also confidence from their board and investors to solicit stock purchases.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Intuit (INTU) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Intuit is 16.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 10.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.4%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Intuit is 32.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.2%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 21.4% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Intuit. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.6% over the past month.Bottom LineIntuit has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Intuit is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over 600 remote accounting positions were listed on Robert Half's job board as of May 2023 which showcases the viability of remote work with the right tools. A survey by ConvergenceCoaching found that the percentage of firms enabling regular or flexible remote work nearly doubled to 80% in 2022, with 43% incorporating remote recruitment into their talent strategy.

However, there's a challenge. Different people have different ways of doing things, which can make it tricky to use automation in accounting.Story continuesStill, more and more companies are using automation in their accounting work.

If you want to skip our primer on Mr. Buffett and insider trading, then jump ahead to Warren Buffett and Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks.The second quarter of 2023 has proven to be an interesting one when it comes to Warren Buffett. As his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway filed its holdings for the period with the SEC, it revealed that Mr. Buffett had shaken things up by quite a bit. During the second quarter, he reduced his investments significantly in five companies and took up new stakes in three new firms. The unfortunate firms in this list are Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). These firms saw Berkshire Hathaway reduce its investments by 71%, 61%, 45%, 40%, and 8%, respectively. Cumulatively, the reduction translated into the investment firm cutting down the stakes by roughly $6.5 billion.The new investments came in some of the biggest home building companies in America, indicating that Mr. Buffett is on board with the significant improvement in sentiment surrounding the industry this year. Home building companies are facing some interesting times since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic, which led to stay at home orders and lock downs, resulted in a large scale shift to remote working. This not only freed up office space but also increased demand for houses in suburban areas as more workers moved to the city outskirts and felt encouraged by low interest rates to buy a house. This sudden surge in demand enabled the home building companies to massively increase their margins - a strategy that benefited them in 2023. The main hurdle for home buyers this year is high interest rates, but big home builders have successfully navigated against this by reducing their margins and offering buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. Naturally, home builder stocks have soared on the market this year, and Mr. Buffett's three new investments in this category are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).Story continuesWarren Buffett's latest SEC filings show that he has invested approximately $814 million in the three home building companies and increased his investment in the financial services firm Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by $409 million. Cumulatively, this shows that he bought $1.2 billion worth of shares of four companies in Q2 2023, which is quite a bit of activity when we consider the stability of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio. This stability comes through the Oracle of Omaha's investment strategy which sees him bide his time and wait patiently before pouncing and plowing billions of dollars into the stock of companies that he deems to be suitable.

This is evident from the fact that on June 29th, 2023 alone, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI filed insider trading charges against ten people in four separate cases. According to the U.S. Attorney, the accused made more than $30 million through 'stolen' and material non public information. The latest insider trading scandals in America include one of the largest companies in the world, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). A Pfizer employee Amit Dagar knew in 2021 that the firm's Paxlovid had generated positive results in a trial for COVID treatment, and he and his associates bought and sold call options to make more than $350,000 in profits.Today, we'll look at some stocks that are favored by both Warren Buffett and insiders to see which lucky companies have seen not only the most successful investor of our time buy their shares, but also confidence from their board and investors to solicit stock purchases.

However, the bottom line declined 29.5% from the $5.97 reported in the year-ago quarter. Nonetheless, earnings per share reflected sequential growth of 58.3%, thanks to sequential improvement in the ongoing EBIT margin.Net sales of $4,792 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,896 million. The top line dropped 6% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange, net sales amounted to $4,813 million, down 5.6% year over year.The decline was mainly the result of the normalization of the promotional environment close to the pandemic levels, which was absent in the first half of 2022.

On a sequential basis, sales improved 3.1% due to seasonality gains.The gross profit for second-quarter 2023 was $816 million, down 9% from the $897 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Ongoing EBIT of $352 million declined 23.6% from $461 million in the year-ago quarter.

On a sequential basis, ongoing EBIT rose 40.2%, with the ongoing EBIT margin expanding 200 bps to 7.3%.In the quarter, the company’s cost take-out actions delivered a $150-million benefit on a year-over-year basis, driven by negating significant cost inflation from 2021 and 2022. Moreover, the company’s portfolio transformation initiatives, targeting a higher-growth, higher-margin business, remain on track. It is poised to reap gains from the housing-driven demand recovery, as it now has eight of the top 10 national builders as its trade customers.Story continuesRegional PerformancesNet sales for the North America segment decreased 4.7% year over year but improved 2.8% sequentially to $2,824 million.

Excluding currency, the segment’s sales rose 4.6% year over year due to market share gains and favorable demand trends in Mexico.

That is because the Sep 15, 2023 $90.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Sempra shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Sempra is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Gas Distribution industry that ranks in the Top 42% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimates.  The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.96 per share to $1.98 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Sempra right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

388,44e1b6e0-0868-3940-a45a-db8b1d353e8c,GE,2023-08-24,11 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-most-undervalued-renewable-energy-214959656.html,1692827399,STORY,"['NRG', 'ENPH', 'VST', 'SEDG', 'TSLA', 'GE', 'NEE']","[In this article, we discuss the 11 most undervalued renewable energy stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy sector, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy.Renewable energy is the fastest-growing energy source in the world as most companies and countries around the world are targeting net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Between 2010 to 2020, renewable energy usage increased by 42% and accounted for 20 percent of utility-scale U.S. electricity generation. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) believes that in 2024, electricity usage through renewables will reach 26% in the US. Furthermore, in 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that global energy sector investments will be at $2.8 trillion, and nearly 61% of that total is expected to be accounted for by renewable energy sources.The biggest economies of the world, the USA and China, have been making significant investments in the industry. In 2022, nearly half of all green energy investments were made in China. The country invested $546 billion in clean energy in 2022, surpassing the United States which made investments worth $141 billion during the same period. Moreover, the European Union recently reached a provisional deal to increase the percentage of renewable energy to 42.5% by 2030 from the current 32%. Since the Paris Agreement of 2015, investments in renewable energy have nearly tripled. Renewable energy investments are also catching pace in South Asian countries as India plans to deploy solar investments of around $25 billion between 2022 to 2027.Challenges Faced by the Renewables SegmentDespite being the fastest-growing segment in the energy sector, installation of clean energy does have its challenges. Weather conditions and time of day significantly affect renewable energy deployment. For example, in 2023, solar energy stocks have been showing a downward trend as storms and rains have delayed solar panel installations.Story continuesIn addition to that, the renewable energy infrastructure costs are quite significant even though the alternative energy usage costs have declined remarkably over the years. Nevertheless, as the technology grows, the costs might go down exponentially. A major factor behind the high costs of clean energy infrastructure is the interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve since early 2022. The high interest rates have affected the deployment as companies mostly borrow money to cover the initial cost of installations and high interest causes an increase in expenditures.Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) was one of the companies that was affected by both of the above-mentioned challenges as mentioned by the Chief Financial Officer of the company, Jeanne Jone during the Q2 2023 earnings conference call:“Earnings are lower in the second quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities as well as $0.03 of unfavorable weather at PECO.”Despite the challenges faced by the renewable energy industry, it is still expected to grow at a tremendous rate and its market size is expected to reach around $2 trillion by 2030. To take advantage of this growth, investors can look towards some prominent clean energy stocks such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).11 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsUbjsP/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyAfter a thorough research of the renewable energy industry, we selected the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders in the second quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was taken from Insider Monkey's database of 910 elite hedge funds.We only chose the stocks that have notable operations or infrastructure in the renewable energy segment and skipped the stocks whose investments in the sector are still in the initial phases.11 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11. NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) is a Texas-based energy company that provides electric utilities to over 7 million customers in the United States. The company distributes electricity through natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear, wind, and solar power sources.In the last three months, 3 out of 4 Wall Street analysts have maintained a Buy rating on NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG). The average analyst price target of $44.25 suggests over 19.5% upside to its stock price on August 21. On July 20, BoFA maintained a Buy rating on the company stock and raised its price target to $46 from $43.In the second quarter, NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was owned by 39 hedge funds with a combined stake value of $1.074 billion.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) are some of the most undervalued renewable energy stocks along with NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG).Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.”10. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is a renewable energy company that develops DC-optimized inverter systems for solar power technology. The company is headquartered in Israel and operates globally.SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)’s stock was owned by 43 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 42 in the previous quarter. D E Shaw increased its stake in the company by 68% in Q2 and remained the largest stakeholder for the second quarter in a row. The firm owned 1.5 million shares of SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) worth $404.651 million.In the last three months, 13 out of 16 Wall Street analysts have kept a Buy or Overweight rating on SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) stock. The average analyst target for the company is $310.06, compared to the stock price of $163 at the August 21 market close.9. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a British integrated oil and gas company. It also has significant operations in renewable energy such as hydrogen and biofuels. The company also has investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is targeting to reduce half of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. On July 27, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) increased its quarterly dividend per American Depository Share by 15% to $0.662. The dividend will be payable by September 18 to the shareholders of record on August 11. On top of that, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) also authorized a $3 billion share repurchase program on the same day.Third Point Management made the following comment about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We initiated a position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in the summer of 2021 and highlighted the company’s significant discount to intrinsic value as well as to US-listed peers after decades of poor performance. While shares have performed well since we initiated the investment, the company still trades at staggering discount to intrinsic value and represents a compelling investment at current levels. We initially argued (and still believe) that the fastest path to improved performance and better valuation would be a separation of Shell’s business units to better attract shareholders and improve accountability, the latter of which was essential when the company was in the hands of executives who had demonstrated virtually no focus on shareholder value creation.The most important change at Shell over the past two years has been the upgrade in the management team, with the appointments of Wael Sawan as CEO and Sinead Gorman as CFO. They have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to shareholder value, capital discipline, and improved returns. At their recent analyst day, Mr. Sawan stated “underpinning all that we do will be a ruthless focus on performance, discipline, and simplification.” It was the third time they used the term “ruthless” in their presentation, sending a strong message to shareholders…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is an American company that provides electric power, natural gas, and energy management services in the United States. It provides utilities to its customers through fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and renewables. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland.On August 3, Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) posted strong Q2 results with a GAAP EPS of $2.56, outperforming the estimates by a huge margin of $1.94. Its revenue of $5.45 billion exceeded the forecasts by $900 million. The company’s stock closed at $101.14 on the day, registering a 5.85% increase from the August 2 close. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) closed at its all-time high of $107 on August 14.Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stock was owned by 46 hedge funds in Q2 2023, at a combined value of $1.85 billion.Alger Capital made the following comment about Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is America’s leading clean energy company, based on carbon-free production. The company is the largest supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, governments, community aggregations, and a range of wholesale customers (such as municipalities, cooperatives, and other end markets) across the continental U.S., backed by approximately 32,400 megawatts of generating capacity consisting of nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric assets. Constellation produces nearly 10% of the nation’s carbon-free energy.Shares outperformed during the third quarter primarily due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Signed into law in august, the bill provides a nuclear production tax credit of approximately $43.75 per megawatt hour of energy generated. This credit favorably impacted earnings, resulting in an increase in Constellation’s share price.”7. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is a Texas-based electricity and power generation company. It owns the world’s largest battery energy storage system at its Moss Landing Power Plant project in California. Additionally, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) provides electricity through several sources, including solar, wind, nuclear, and natural gas.Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)’s stock was a part of 48 investment portfolios in Q2 2023 and their total stake was valued at $1.58 billion. In the previous quarter, it was owned by 46 hedge funds with a total stake value of $1.51 billion. Oaktree Capital Management held the largest stake in the company with 17 million shares worth $446.25 million.Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share, compared to the previous $0.204. It is payable by September 29 to the shareholders of record on September 20. The company has raised its dividend for the last four years and has a yield of 2.75% as of August 21.Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“I sent the 2019 letter on February 10, 2020. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) closed that day at $22.27. As I write in early January the price is $22.30. Now I did say “We would actually prefer it if both (VST &amp; NRG) securities went nowhere for as long possible”—assuming repurchased shares at depressed valuations was our best-case scenario. But A) I didn’t think I’d be that right with respect to “nowhere”, and B) I certainly didn’t think I’d be right 3-years on. Here we are though, with the stock literally going nowhere for the last 3-years. Just like we drew it up!“Management has indeed repurchased 20.3% of the shares outstanding since year-end 2019 and will probably repurchase another 12-15% of the outstanding shares in 2023. My initial assumption was that management could plausibly repurchase 60% of their shares by 2030, leaving them with 200mn outstanding (that assumed shares were appreciating and they had to pay more as the years went on, not what’s transpired so far), but at the current pace of about 50mn shares repurchased per year, they’ll hit that mark by the end of 2026, which would imply free cash flow of $10 pershare if the underlying business continues to perform as it currently is. That’s a 45% FCF yield on today’s price. Meanwhile, dividends per share have grown 54% since 2019 and the stock now yields 3.5%, growing about 15% a year.Being paid to wait makes waiting much easier. We had sold VST shares in mid-2020, replacing some of the position with call options, to free up capital for other opportunities that became available. But when winter storm Uri hit Texas in February 2021 and VST shares went down 20%+, below $17 a share, we rebuilt our common equity position. Today VST oscillates between the biggest and second biggest position in the fund, depending on weekly performance.”6. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) provides solar power solutions, battery energy storage solutions, and EV charging stations. The company focuses primarily on residential customers. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is headquartered in California and serves over 140 countries. With 50 hedge funds holding a stake in the company, it is our 6th most undervalued renewable energy stock to buy according to hedge funds.Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) has been covered by 24 analysts in the last three months according to Tipranks. 17 of those analysts are bullish on the company stock and the average price target of all the analysts is $199.86, showing a 53.55% upside to its stock price of $130.16 on August 21. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is one of the most undervalued technology stocks according to Wall Street analysts.Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) joins the likes of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in our list of most undervalued renewable energy stocks.Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC made the following comment about Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) designs, develops, manufactures and sells home energy solutions in the U.S. and internationally for the solar industry. The company is the world’s leading manufacturer of microinverters that convert solar-generated D.C. energy to A.C. energy usable in homes and buildings. Enphase introduced the world’s first microinverter system in 2008 and has expanded its offerings to include battery storage systems and proprietary technologies that provide energy monitoring and control services for solar energy systems. It sells its products and solutions directly to solar system distributors, large installers and strategic partners.We see Enphase having a substantial market share that is gained through a premium product offering, superior customer service and the development of a large and diverse network of solar installers and distributors. The company’s products and services address a growing residential solar market. Coupling battery backup systems with existing and newly installed residential solar systems could accelerate the company’s revenue and earnings growth over the next several years, in our view. Additionally, commercial and international expansion offer additional revenue and earnings upside.

390,9aa565e4-3481-3e46-8ea9-1ee83464370e,VLO,2023-08-24,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-valero-energy-110016771.html,1692874816,STORY,['VLO'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Valero Energy is US$139 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityValero Energy's US$129 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Analyst price target for VLO is US$146, which is 5.2% above our fair value estimateDoes the August share price for Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.81bUS$4.72bUS$3.99bUS$4.01bUS$3.66bUS$3.46bUS$3.35bUS$3.30bUS$3.29bUS$3.30bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -8.65%Est @ -5.41%Est @ -3.14%Est @ -1.55%Est @ -0.44%Est @ 0.34% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$5.3kUS$4.0kUS$3.1kUS$2.9kUS$2.4kUS$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.3b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.2%) = US$52bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$52b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$23bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$49b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$129, the company appears about fair value at a 6.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Valero Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.303. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Valero EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can go to 5 Most Innovative Companies of All Time.Humans have been innovating since they first stepped foot on Earth. For any civilization, innovation was a milestone that changed the way of living. Today’s competitive market environment heavily depends on innovation. Entrepreneurs are constantly looking for unconventional ways to design new products and services to overcome old solutions. With the saturation of global markets, innovation has become critical across all industries. Innovation is a time taking process that requires a thorough understanding of the business idea and proper implementation.As we mentioned earlier, innovation has become a buzzword since the launch of Apple’s first iPhone and it still circulates in the market, the media, and schools. Companies are focused on innovation more than ever before and it has become a prime target for executives. Startup is a new fancy name in the business world and the hype around this word is surreal. You can't understand the dynamics of a startup unless you work on a business idea. There are chances of failure and businesses that entered the market have experienced both success and failure. For instance, Quibi is one of the biggest startup failures in recent times. The short-form American streaming platform generated $1.75 billion from venture capitalists and media houses in two funding rounds. It was a few weeks before the target launch of Quibi when the world went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 6, 2020, Quibi launched its streaming platform in the U.S. and Canada. The company went on to release its streaming platform undermining the sudden shift in the market following the pandemic. A few months later on October 22, Quibi decided to quit its operations. Quibi’s founders pointed out the pandemic to be the root cause of its failure. However, it was the wrong decision-making of the founders which led to a collapse of such a massive investment. Therefore, running a startup and bringing innovation to the market isn't that simple. It requires building up a corporate setup that demands patience, right timing, and a lot of resources. Elon Musk in a podcast with Lex Fridman said, “What matters is the pace of innovation, access to resources, and raw materials.” Story continuesWhy Innovation?For a company, innovation is a tool through which it survives the competition. Creativity is the key aspect of innovation and in business, creativity cultivates unique ideas. Creative ideas play a viable role in producing solutions to problems. However, creative ideas don’t guarantee innovation, but for an idea to be innovative, it must be useful for the consumer. James Chin Moody who holds a Ph.D. in innovation theory believes that innovation is not a noun but rather a process of technological change. Moody who is the CEO of Australian package delivery company, Sendle, while talking to CNBC Make It said:“Innovation is the process of creating the thing, yes, but that’s such a small fraction. It’s the process of taking the thing and convincing someone that they need the thing. The process in the middle is really what we mean when we talk about innovation.”In the modern world, every company has adopted innovation in the form of technology. In the context of business, innovation conceives, develops, delivers, and scales new products and services. In an episode of the Inside the Strategy Room podcast, McKinsey’s senior partner Laura Furstenthal defined innovation in a corporate setup:“If you look up 'innovation' in a dictionary, you see definitions like creating novel ideas or even just the word 'creativity.' We believe you have to think about the impact, so our definition of innovation incorporates delivering net new growth that is sustainable, repeatable, and substantial. You can focus on new products, markets, customers, or business models, but however you measure it, innovation has to increase value and drive growth.”As we mentioned earlier, value innovation is really important for a company’s survival. Value innovation comprises the introduction of new products and minimization of costs at the same time. Every company once started with a small setup and grew bigger with time. In McKinsey’s research on the existence of innovation “essentials,” the study focused on how competent 183 companies were at innovation. The research compared those companies with a proprietary database of economic profit, which was net profit subtracted from the cost of capital. The study revealed that companies that adopted innovation had a significant advantage over their peers. The companies with the most innovation essentials generated higher economic profit, up to 2.4 times higher than other players.Contemporary InnovationAutomotive, technology, biotechnology, and healthcare and pharmaceutical industries comprise some of the most innovative companies worldwide. Technology is a diversified segment including computer and information technology. Computer technology has evolved over the past few years and semiconductors chips are the key to the innovation of this segment, thanks to advancements in semiconductor technology. In today's world, almost everything we own and operate on a daily basis has semiconductors in it. Semiconductors have really lifted the game of processors in the computing world.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) are two of the leading semiconductor chip makers in the market. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been doing a remarkable job as the company continues to move uphill. The semiconductor company is set to announce its second quarter results on August 23. Analysts are really interested in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and have raised their targets ahead of earnings. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri lifted NVIDIA’s stock price target to $540 from $475. Similarly, Wells Fargo has also upgraded its price target to $500 from $450. Analysts are bullish on the stock and Morgan Stanley has named NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as its “top pick.” ""We think it's hard to bet against NVDA's preeminent positioning as the primary beneficiary of an AI-driven architectural data center transformation,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers in his research note. The semiconductor giant has been under the radar this year, driven by optimism around its potential for AI and demand for its components. Global firms and governments are seeking NVIDIA chips for the all-important build-up of AI software. E-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been using NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs to power Amazon Web Services. AWS and NVIDIA have been in partnership for more than 10 years and have developed solutions for virtual workstations, machine learning, high-performance computing, and IoT services. On March 21, AWS and NVIDIA joined hands to build the world's most scalable, on-demand AI system that will solve complex large language models and create generative AI applications. On May 23, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) collaborated to accelerate their AI initiatives. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will integrate NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software into its Azure Machine Learning. This will allow Azure customers to speed up their production, deployment, and management of customized applications through 100 NVIDIA AI frameworks and NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Whereas Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is keeping up with the chipmaker and is aiming to create a bigger ecosystem that is more power-efficient than Nvidia’s chip. Google has built its custom chip called the Tensor Processing Unit. The chip is handling 90% of the company's work on AI training. On April 4, Cornell University published a paper in which Google claimed to have a 1.7 times faster and 1.9 times more power-efficient system compared to Nvidia's A100 chip. These tech giants are really shaping the future and innovating technology through AI and semiconductors. The demand for semiconductors is continuing to rise and electric cars are one of the biggest semiconductor marketplaces. Electric cars are highly dependent on semiconductor chips. The innovation in semiconductor technology potentially offers longer battery life for EVs. Moreover, the chips make the EV system smarter and safer to provide risk-free rides. EVs are using AI and semiconductors simultaneously to improve the ecosystem of electric cars for their passengers. Moreover, semiconductors are also being used at the backend of systems to support the software of EVs. Elon Musk has hinted that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is highly dependent on NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. Here are some of the comments from Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Q2 2023 earnings call:“You see a lot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. I would say if they’re so great, why can’t they make a self-driving car? Because it’s harder. That’s why. So -- but I do think -- I think there’s some great AI companies out there. But just fundamentally, the staggering amount of data we’ve got to process, it’s got to be processed somehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that.So that’s what Dojo is designed to do is optimize for video training. It’s not optimized for LLMs. It’s optimized for video training. With video training, you have a much higher ratio of compute-to-memory bandwidth, so -- whereas LLMs tends to be memory bandwidth choked. So that’s it. I mean -- but like I said, we’re also -- we have some -- we’re using a lot of NVIDIA hardware. We’ll continue to -- we’ll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast as NVIDIA will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They’ve done an incredible job.And frankly, I don’t know if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can’t. So they’ve got so many customers. They’ve been kind enough to, nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders. But yes, the sheer magnitude of video training -- because like I said, we’re not trying to just get as good as human. We want to get to 10 times better than human, maybe 100 times better than human.”Whereas NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) counterpart Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is planning to reveal a new series of Radeon graphics cards. The senior vice president of AMD, Scott Herkelman in a tweet mentioned that the chip maker is set to make major announcements at Gamescom. Herkelman didn’t point out any specifics about the announcements. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su during the Q1 2023 earnings call said that they were on track to launch the GPU ramp of MI300 in Q4 2023.""And then I would say, from an overall market standpoint, I think enterprise will still be mixed with the notion that we expect some improvement. It depends a little bit on the macro situation. And then as we go into the second half of the year, in addition to Genoa, we’re also ramping Bergamo. So that’s on track to launch here in the second quarter and will ramp in the second half of the year. And then as we get towards the end of the year, we also have our GPU ramp of MI300. So with that, we start the ramp in the fourth quarter of our supercomputing wins as well as our early cloud AI wins. So those are all the factors. Of course, we’ll have to see how the the year play about how we’re positioned from an overall product and road map standpoint for Data Center.""While innovation is usually linked to technological advancements, there are companies outside of the tech sector that are and have been innovating in their respective domains for decades now. Let's take a look at some of the most innovative companies of all time.25 Most Innovative Companies of All TimeSergey Nivens/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe took the 25 companies from the most innovative companies list published by Forbes, BCG, PwC, and CEOWorld Magazine. We ranked the companies based on their appearance in a number of sources and average scores. So, the company that appeared in all four sources and had the least average score on the list was ranked higher, and so on. The average score was calculated by simply summing up the ranks of each company in each source and then dividing it by the number of sources. This had the effect of assigning a greater average score to companies that were ranked lower in our sources and similarly assigning a lower average score to companies that were ranked at the top. The companies with an equal number of sources and average scores are ranked based on the highest ranking given in the references.

Over the past week,18 price targets across multiple sectors have been lowered, with no letup in sight. An almost equal number of price targets also were cut in the previous week.In fairness, an equal number of price target raises have occurred this past week, but 13 of the 18 originated with just three analysts: Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan, Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI Group and Craig Schmidt of Bank of America Securities. The price hikes affected just three subsectors — Paolone raised price targets on four residential REITs, Sakwa raised targets on seven office REITs, and Schmidt raised targets on two retail REITs.By contrast, 12 analysts lowered price targets on seven REIT subsectors. Of the 18 price cuts, 15 were on REITs where the analyst maintained the previous rating, and three were on new downgrades.Given the recent news on interest rates, along with weakness in the REIT sector, it's possible that further price target cuts could negatively affect REIT prices for the remainder of 2023.The chart below shows the REITs that had price targets slashed this week.

Someone who bought American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT) at $100 may react quite differently to a target price cut than someone who bought the stock at $205.Story continuesIf one is strictly an income investor, if the REIT does not cut nor eliminate the dividend, there is no reason to panic sell on a price decline. Only the income generated every month or quarter is important. If the dividend yield is substantially greater than the yield on shares already owned, it could be a good opportunity for an investor to add to their preexisting shares.The other question to consider is whether the basic fundamentals of the stock have changed. A rising interest rate environment may take share prices down, but the economic climate can change in a few months. That's different from a company that has lost a once-held competitive advantage or whose management has changed for the worse.Investors should keep in mind that analysts are only correct about 50% of the time, so investors should always perform their own due diligence and never rely on the opinion of an analyst alone in making investment decisions.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

It also came while home prices and mortgage rates are still high and consumer sentiment low.The investment giant picked up shares from D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN.B) and NVR (NVR), according to information in a filing it made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Most of the investment was made in D.R. Horton, the nation’s largest homebuilder that’s upping its stake in single-family rentals.Buffett currently sits at No. 6 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and fifth on Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List with a net worth of about $118 billion. Known for his concentrated portfolio that produces strong returns over the long term, Buffett has the experience, the clout and the wealth to bet big and single-handedly sway market trends.Many see these stock purchases as a positive sign for the struggling real estate market. But should you follow Buffett’s lead?Betting Big Like BuffettThe mere fact that Berkshire has made such a big splash in the home building industry speaks volumes. However, whether you should dive in depends on how confident you are that a housing rebound is on its way.According to The Wall Street Journal, current homeowners — already locked into low mortgages — are unwilling to sell their homes, making new construction “the only game in town.” Builder confidence fell in August but rose in the seven previous months this year. Publicly traded home builder shares have outperformed expectations this year and The WSJ is quick to point out that the three largest home builders, which include D.R. Horton and Lennar (and PulteGroup), did ever better.Story continuesMoney Expert Jaspreet Singh: Get Rich Through These 3 InvestmentsInvestors like Buffett are wagering that the housing market is due to not only rebound, but boom. Not surprisingly, all three housing companies saw rises in stock prices after news of Berkshire’s interest was announced.Spending around $814 million on stocks might seem like a confident gamble, but as Investor’s Business Daily noted, the investments totalled less than 0.25% of Berkshire’s stock portfolio, which was valued at $353.4 billion on June 30. The best bet for you might be to go in similarly small, but do go in.Berkshire Hathaway bought the following stock in the second quarter, according to its latest 13F filing (all fund managers with at least $100 million in assets must publicly disclose their stock holdings to the SEC each quarter using a Form 13F):DHI: 6 million shares worth $726.5 million as of June 30.

The first bullet point from the trade group offered a seemingly tantalizing concession to striking writers: the largest wage increase in 35 years.In reality, it amounted to a 5% raise in the first year.The small salary bump proposed to the movie and TV writers is in stark contrast to the far bigger gains made just this week by American Airlines pilots and the UPS Teamsters—the nation’s largest private-sector union. American Airlines pilots approved a new labor agreement Tuesday that would give its members 21% raises immediately, with a 46% increase over the four-year contract. And the UPS Teamsters union got a 35% increase in its minimum member pay.By comparison, writers union members would get just one-seventh of what UPS union members and one fourth of what the pilots union received in the first year of their contracts.The three-year deal offered by the AMPTP would give the WGA, the union representing screenwriters, additional pay increases of 4% and 3.5% in the second and third years of the contract.The WGA and AMPTP did not respond to requests for comment.Negotiations between the writers and the studios have been acrimonious. Even the studios merely making their counteroffer public was criticized. The writers union said the move was meant to divide members, by trying to get them to squabble over which parts of the counterproposal should be kept or negotiated further. “It is their only strategy—to bet that we will turn on each other,” the WGA wrote in a statement.Story continuesThe studios’ proposal was released after a Tuesday meeting of studio executives including Disney CEO Bob Iger, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, and Universal Filmed Entertainment Group chair Donna Langley. The WGA called into question whether the executives even intended to reach an agreement. “This wasn’t a meeting to make a deal,” the writers union statement said. “This was a meeting to get us to cave, which is why, not 20 minutes after we left the meeting, the AMPTP released its summary of their proposals.”What else are the WGA and the AMPTP still negotiating over?Similar to those of UPS drivers and American Airlines pilots, WGA members’ demands go beyond just pay increases; the union originally asked for first-year pay raises of 6% and 5% in the following two years—as well as changes to on-the-job working conditions.The AMPTP counterproposal also included some protections against A.I.-written scripts—a major point of contention—to ensure that they not be considered literary material. The proposal would mean writers wouldn’t lose any compensation if A.I. were used to create a script that they also contributed to. In the past the WGA has been open to using A.I. so long as it didn’t come at the expense of writers’ credits and take-home pay.The studio’s counteroffer made some concessions to another of the technological upheavals created by Silicon Valley: residuals for streaming. For the first time, studios and streamers appear open to the idea of reporting data regarding streaming viewership. Under the current proposal, the WGA would get access to “quarterly confidential reports” that would include the hours viewed per streamed program. The statement includes language promising to restructure current standards for residual payments—or rather nonpayments—for content that goes on streaming platforms.In the past streaming data has been kept confidential by streaming services and studios. This reluctance to share viewership numbers means that writers and actors for hit shows don’t earn extra residual payments for streamed content as they might for television or for theatrical releases. That can sometimes cost writers and actors big money. In 2021, actress Scarlett Johansson sued Disney for breach of contract when it premiered a feature film she starred in both in theaters and on its recently launched Disney+ streaming service. Johansson alleged that the decision was made partly to avoid paying her bigger box-office-related bonuses. The suit was later settled out of court for a reported $40 million.Another major sticking point in the negotiations is the number of writers that showrunners will be allowed to hire. The WGA’s original proposal required a minimum of five writers, while the AMPTP’s recent counteroffer was two writers, with the option to add more for longer shows. The proposal also addresses WGA demands that some writers be kept on staff through the entire production so they can gain production experience, beyond the writers’ room.If the UPS and American Airlines labor agreements are any indication, a strained relationship during negotiations doesn’t preclude unions from securing the wages and benefits they’re seeking. Negotiations between UPS and its union employees were considered dead just days before workers were to go on strike, and American Airlines pilots rejected multiple deals going back to November of last year. It got so bad that just days after rival United Airlines finalized a deal with its pilots union, Ed Sicher, president of the union representing American Airlines pilots, issued a press release titled, “Will They Attempt to Lowball Us Again?” But a few weeks later, he was celebrating a deal that offered “substantial monetary gains and quality-of-life improvements.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Ed Sicher, president of the Allied Pilots Association (APA) union that serves about 15,000 AA pilots, said in a statement. He also said the agreement provides substantial monetary gains and quality-of-life improvements.For American Airlines, the agreement will help to immediately expand pilot training capacity to support under-used aircraft and provide opportunities for pilots to progress in their careers, AA CEO Robert Isom said in a statement.About 73% of pilots voted in favor of the contract, which includes $1.1 billion in immediate one-time payments and ratification bonuses as well as annual pay rate increases for the contract’s duration. It becomes amendable on Aug. 1, 2027, with a provision for the next round of bargaining to begin as soon as November 2026.On July 27, the union and AA management reached an agreement in principle that included contingency clauses tied to United Airline pilots ratifying their separate agreement in principle with management by Jan. 1, 2024. The plan includes an agreement to raise American Airlines pay rates to match those of United and Delta airlines, the latter of which reached a deal with its pilots in March.American Airlines flight attendants still eyeing strikeSeveral other pilots unions are still seeking new contracts or are in talks with their carriers, however. These include FedEx pilots, who rejected a tentative agreement with their carrier last month. Also, the federal National Mediation Board (NMB) denied Southwest Airlines Pilots Association’s request to be released from mediation and halt talks with Southwest earlier this month.Story continuesMeanwhile, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union representing more than 26,000 AA flight attendants, began a strike authorization vote on July 28, which is set to close on Aug. 29.APFA made a filing with the NMB in April. The group said that that if it cannot reach an agreement with American Airlines management, it could request to be released in 30 days, after which its members would be free to strike.Related ContentSouthwest Airlines Bracing for Pilots Strike: Kiplinger Economic ForecastsPilot Shortages Bad News for PassengersLabor Unions Not Backing Down as Strikes Loom: Kiplinger Economic ForecastsBest Travel Rewards Credit Cards]"

This rise is likely to get reflected in the bottom-line results of the third quarter.The approval of the deal, which is valued at $9.6 billion over its tenure, makes AAL’s pilots eligible for an immediate pay raise in excess of 21%, on average, as it includes roughly $1.1 billion in immediate, one-time payments and ratification bonuses. The deal also has provisions for retroactive pay for the first four months of 2023. This implies that $230 million will get reflected as additional expenses in the September-quarter results.Including the expenditures associated with the deal, American Airlines now expects third-quarter cost per available seat mile excluding fuel and net special items or CASM-ex to rise in the 4-6% band on a year-over-year basis (prior guidance: 2-4% year-over-year jump).However, full-year 2023 guidance for the metric (even after including the pilot-deal related costs) remains the same due to changes in the projected timing of other expense items.

Sell the component and exchange the capital. Rinse and repeat.But in today's global marketplace, discrete product transactions are more frequently replaced by larger system solutions. Reliable guidance, service and support are often just as critical as the solution itself. Indeed, today's B2B market transactions are multifaceted, and customer conditions are changing at a rate unlike any previously experienced. Customers aren't always in the market for a one-off solution to an easily identifiable obstacle-they need future-proofed solutions for complications they may not yet know are coming. Are the customers always right if they are uncertain about what will best help them meet their goals?Electrification and the race to net zeroFor example: as the world races to deliver on net-zero pledges, companies must reconcile growing their businesses while reducing negative climate contributions, including carbon emissions, which can be achieved by switching from fossil fuels to electricity for energy needs. Indeed, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electrification is the dominant focus in net-zero emissions. This is a new frontier and the increasing global demand for electricity* will likely challenge industrial companies in unprecedented ways. In addition to more investment in electricity generation, there is a significant focus on growing and modernizing electricity networks to support this generation.Put simply, industrial-scale electrical systems are becoming more interconnected and more intricate. Consider that building operators must increase load capacity to handle more and larger electrical equipment as well as more sophisticated building energy management systems (BEMS). Data centers are increasing their footprint - to handle the world's growing electrification and computing requirements - and density, necessitating solutions such as more frequent cooling and uninterruptable power solutions to ensure the world's access to information doesn't suffer downtime. And oil and gas companies are seeking more sustainable operations by exploring integrated energy companies with more electrical elements. All this exploration and commitment to a greener future requires significant vision and capital outlay.Story continuesThese massive paradigm shifts will open new opportunities, but will also bring new challenges. Discrete, one-time purchases may not solve them. Rather, strategic partnerships with trusted suppliers who can help companies anticipate the challenges associated with a dynamic future can become invaluable.""This is a new frontier and the increasing global demand for electricity will likely challenge industrial companies in unprecedented ways.

Given the company’s experience in the high-hazard business, it expects to retain policyholders and attract new business in the future.AMERISAFE, with a market cap of $993.5 million, is a leading specialty provider of workers’ compensation insurance, which markets and underwrites its insurance through subsidiaries. The company focuses on providing coverage to small to mid-sized employers engaged in hazardous industries. It primarily operates in trucking, logging, construction, agriculture, maritime and other industries.Zacks Rank &amp; Price RallyAMERISAFE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company’s shares have gained 0.2% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s 2.2% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReturn on Equity (ROE)ROE, a measure reflecting how efficiently a company utilizes shareholders’ money, was 17.7% in the trailing 12 months, better than the industry’s average of 15.9%.Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMERISAFE’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $2.88 per share. It has witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past 30 days against one in the opposite direction. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters.The consensus estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $302.6 million, indicating 1.1% growth from the prior-year reported figure.Business TailwindsDue to its vast experience as a provider of workers’ compensation insurance in hazardous industries and a disciplined risk selection approach, AMERISAFE fetches higher premiums. A rebounding economy, strong retention and enhanced agent relations are likely to support its new business growth. Strong audit premiums are expected to drive premium revenues in the future.Net investment income is expected to gain from higher income from higher yields on fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents. The metric increased 19.1% in the second quarter.Story continuesThe company’s strong financial flexibility, with no debt and a solid operating cash flow, is impressive. In the first half of 2023, the company generated an operating cash flow of $20.7 million.The company’s financial flexibility allows it to engage in shareholder-friendly moves. The company handsomely returns capital to investors through share repurchases and dividends. It did not repurchase any shares in the first half of 2023 but paid a quarterly cash dividend of 34 cents per share. Its dividend yield came in at 2.6%, higher than the industry average of 2.4%. As of Jun 30, 2023, $12.6 million was left under the authorized share buyback program.A Risk to Keep an Eye OnThere are a few factors that are impeding growth of AMSF. The company faces stiff market competition, which somewhat affects its pricing. Also, product concentration risks and elevated expenses levels are concerning.Although total expenses decreased 7.9% year over year to $56.1 million in the second quarter, the expense ratio deteriorated. We expect total expenses to increase by 1.2% in 2023. This can affect its future operations. Nevertheless, a systematic and strategic plan will drive AMSF’s long-term growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Accident and Health insurance space are Employers Holdings, Inc. EIG, Trupanion, Inc. TRUP and Aflac Incorporated AFL.

It keeps an eye to minimize administrative burdens that often follow after the claim submission as well as deliver emotional support to beneficiaries. Such services are of dire need as they better equip the families to cope up with the loss of a loved one.With the integration of technology with human assistance, the Empathy platform extends administrative support in the form of on-demand bereavement concierge services, estate administration experts, probate guidance, funeral support, property clearance, family collaboration features and an account deactivation hub.

These services form a part of its group benefits offerings. Time and again, it has resorted to acquisitions or partnerships for strengthening the Group Benefits business.Integrating beneficial features, such as access to the Empathy platform, within its services offerings are likely to lure more customers to opt for MET’s life insurance policies.

Amid this, Federal Realty FRT is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of premium assets in the United States.A diversified tenant base, a focus on essential retail and mixed-use assets and the balance sheet strength of the company augur well. However, high e-commerce adoption is likely to weigh on Federal Realty. Macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-interest-rate environment add to its woes.This retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) properties are located in the first-ring suburbs of the nine major metropolitan markets of the United States, mainly in the key coastal markets from Washington DC to Boston, MA, San Francisco and Los Angeles.Due to the strong demographics and infill nature of its properties, Federal Realty has been able to maintain a high occupancy level over the years. Occupancy rates in the portfolio increased 80 basis points (bps) year over year to 92.8% as of Jun 30, 2023.Furthermore, with solid consumer spending and the rebound in the retail industry, the retail REIT is poised to benefit from its superior assets in premium locations and experience an improving leasing environment. We estimate the leased occupancy rate for 2023 to be 94.3%.The company has a well-diversified tenant base of retailers, including TJX Companies, Kroger and CVS Corporation. This minimizes risks related to any particular retail industry and assures a stable source of rental revenues. For 2023, we estimate the company’s rental income to grow 4.8% year over year.Federal Realty’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, will enable it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play. Moreover, FRT’s expansion efforts into premium markets and initiatives to redevelop and reposition its assets seem encouraging.Federal Realty focuses on maintaining a decent balance sheet position with ample liquidity. The company exited second-quarter 2023 with $1.3 billion of total liquidity. Its investment-grade credit ratings render the company favorable access to the debt market. With a strong balance sheet, FRT is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders, and Federal Realty is committed to the same. In August 2023, concurrent with the second-quarter 2023 earnings release, FRT announced a hike in its regular quarterly cash dividend to $1.09 per share from $1.08 paid out earlier. The company has paid out uninterrupted dividends since its inception in 1962, and the latest hike marked the 56th consecutive year of common dividend increases by the company.Moreover, backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we expect funds from operations (FFO) to increase 5.3% in 2023. Given the company’s solid operating platform, our FFO growth projections and balance sheet strength compared with industry counterparts, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.Moreover, shares of Federal Realty have risen 7.6% over the past three months, outperforming its industry’s growth of 3.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, given the conveniences of online shopping, high e-commerce adoption is concerning for Federal Realty. Online retailing will remain a popular choice among customers, adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Further, amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-interest-rate environment, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent in the coming quarters. Also, the likelihood of tenant bankruptcies in the near term could affect the company’s profitability and hurt occupancy. Moreover, elevated interest rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses suggests a year-over-year increase of 20.5%. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts amid high interest rates.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG and Saul Centers, Inc.

American Water Works’ unit has plans to invest in critical infrastructure in the first year, which will enhance water quality and system reliability.Illinois American Water is active in expanding its operations through inorganic routes. The company acquired the Village of Tolono’s water and wastewater systems for $9.416 million in June 2023, its first acquisition in 2023.

Owing to the many small operators in the industry and a lack of adequate funds, essential infrastructural upgrades and repairs get delayed at times.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments in infrastructure upgrades and the continuation of high-quality customer service. American Water Works is the largest, most geographically diverse and most publicly traded water and wastewater utility company that continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.Large water utilities are acquiring smaller units to expand operations and extend their high-quality services to the acquired smaller units. However, the pace of acquisitions needs to accelerate, as there are too many small units in the United States that require attention and funding.Story continuesInvestments for Water SpacePer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an estimated $744 billion in investment is necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years.

""So we just believe that the customer is coming under pressure because these are new realities that they have to continue to deal with as we get through the back half of this year and move into next year.""A similar warning came this month from the world's largest retailer, Walmart.""Jobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers. But rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs and tightening lending standards, and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told Wall Street when the retailer reported earnings.Federal student loans will begin to accrue interest again on Sept. 1, with payments resuming on Oct. 1.Read more: Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could helpTransUnion's head of global research and consulting Charlie Wise tells Yahoo Finance that roughly 40 million consumers will face the ""payment shock"" when student debt relief ends.A man carries flowers and balloons during Los Angeles Mission College's 48th annual commencement ceremony on June 6, 2023. (Hans Gutknecht/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images via Getty Images)Consumers were already having trouble paying off credit card debt, as Macy's warned this week. Now, the return of student loan payments could make financial matters worse, with execs warning that the extra expense may lead consumers to pull back spending in other areas.Yahoo Finance takes a look at the consumer stocks with the most at risk.Retailers with most student loan payment exposureSome retailers appear more vulnerable to repayment shock than others heading into the crucial back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.Story continues""We are most cautious on brands with high exposure to student debt holders and inferior value perceptions amongst 18-34-year-olds, the most representative demographic of student debt holders,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients.The research team at TD Cowen highlighted Target (TGT) and Ulta (ULTA) as particularly vulnerable, due to their exposure to younger, low-income consumers with student loans.""The resumption of student loan repayments is one of many factors that we're watching really closely,"" Target CFO Michael Fiddelke told Yahoo Finance as the retailer slashed its full-year profit outlook.Other ""most-exposed"" stocks to younger, lower-income student borrowers, according to TD Cowen analysts, include Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), FIGS (FIGS), Foot Locker (FL), Burlington Stores (BURL), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote that US student debt borrowers will likely pull back spending on apparel overall since they ""prefer brands over private label and specialty retailers over discounters.""This is bad news for American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Carter's (CRI), Crocs (CROX), Canada Goose (GOOS), The Gap (GPS), Nordstrom (JWN), Nike (NKE), Steven Madden (SHOO), Under Armour (UAA), and Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. (VSCO), Sole said.Stores with a higher discretionary product mix also face higher risk, according to JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers.That includes Target and Ulta, Horvers noted, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Best Buy (BBY), followed by Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Costco (COST), and Walmart, with the primary difference driven by the former group's higher mix of discretionary product.On the flip side, auto parts stocks are less at risk ""given their lower-income exposure and low discretionary mix,"" Horvers wrote in a note to investors.Meanwhile, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) ""remains a question mark"" as its ""geo-weighted exposure to student loans ranks it high offset by its largely non-discretionary mix (85% grocery),"" Horvers added.Restaurants watch for sales weaknessWhen it comes to spending at restaurants, TD Cowen's Charles said he estimates up to ""a 2% annual headwind to restaurant industry spending as student loan payments resume.""The team at TD Cowen suggested Jack in the Box (JACK), Dutch Bros (BROS), and Sweetgreen (SG) may face headwinds. Investors should also tread lightly with tobacco and beverage brands, such as Altria Group (MO), British American Tobacco (BATS), and Monster Beverage (MNST).Even higher-end plays in the restaurant space aren't immune.Cava — where a salad bowl can set one back $14 — expressed caution on the consumer outlook in its latest earnings.CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance that student loan payments restarting was one of the ""multitude of factors"" up against consumers, along with higher gas prices, costly utility bills, and a ""hawkish Fed.""""So we're mindful of those pressures,"" Schulman said. ""We saw a resilient consumer in Q2, but we'd be remiss if we didn't take those considerations into account.""Of course, not all borrowers will have to pay right away.Those still in school remain ""in the regular forbearance period,"" TransUnion's Wise points out. ""But we think that about 26 million-27 million consumers will be facing the beginning or resumption of payments in the next couple of weeks.""There's another catch: The Department of Education is instituting a 12-month ""on-ramp"" for repayment from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024. Though interest will accrue during this period, financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments won't be considered delinquent or reported to credit bureaus and debt collectors.Cowen's Charles said in a note to clients this ""likely pushes any major impact to spending to late next year.""Are you an American with student loan debt or a company nervous about the return of student loan payments?

The Fed raised rates in July after pausing in June. Futures traders expect another pause in September, but the outlook on whether another rate hike this year will happen is foggier. There's about a 35% probability of another quarter-point hike in November.What the Fed does longer term is also something investors will be listening for in Powell's speech.
