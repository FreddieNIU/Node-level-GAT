Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$145m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, for US$19m worth of shares, at about US$69.43 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$81.77). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.2% of Charles Schwab's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Charles Schwab than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Charles Schwab. In total, insiders dumped US$46m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Charles Schwab Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Charles Schwab insiders own 6.4% of the company, worth about US$9.7b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Charles Schwab Tell Us?Insiders sold Charles Schwab shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that Charles Schwab is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, STMicroelectronics has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that STM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TXN has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.STM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.01, while TXN has a forward P/E of 17.81. We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 1.80. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.91.Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P/B ratio of 2.98. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TXN has a P/B of 10.30.These metrics, and several others, help STM earn a Value grade of A, while TXN has been given a Value grade of C.STM sticks out from TXN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that STM is the better option right now.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Visa is undoubtedly faced with a number of near-term challenges, but it is well positioned for long-term growth on the back of numerous buyouts and alliances. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payment to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.The gradual revival of the global economy will keep driving consumer spending, expanding V’s business volumes in turn.

While Texas Instruments is faced with the same macroeconomic challenges that have brought down its peers, its business is lot more stable and resilient than other chip makers. Texas Instruments is benefiting from solid rebound in the automotive market. Further, solid demand environment in the industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a major positive.Additionally, solid momentum across Analog segment owing to robust signal chain and power product lines, is contributing well to the top line.

It has significant acreages in oil shale plays like Delaware, Bakken and Eagle Ford.The company estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations in those promising shale plays, brightening the production outlook. Also, EOG’s balance sheet is significantly less levered than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. EOG strongly focuses on returning capital to shareholders, as reflected in its plan to return $5.1 billion of cash this year through regular quarterly and special dividends.However, EOG Resources reported lower-than-expected third quarter earnings owing to higher lease and well expenses and transportation costs.

However, constraints in the Japan business are a concern.Transformation Initiatives Aid Trane (TT), Low Liquidity AilThe Zacks analyst is positive about Trane Technologies' focus on improving its operating system and innovation through transformation initiatives. Low liquidity remains a concern.Robust Digital Sales Aid Yum! Brands (YUM), Cost HighPer the Zacks analyst, Yum! Brands benefits from robust digitalization.

However, stiff competition and leveraged balance sheet remain concerns.Sturdy Comps Run to Fuel Grocery Outlet's (GO) Top LinePer the Zacks analyst, Grocery Outlet's opportunistic purchasing, marketing efforts and new product offerings facilitate comparable-store sales growth. Third-quarter comparable-store sales rose 15.4%.New UpgradesStrategic Buyouts, Higher Rates Support LPL Financial (LPLA)Per the Zacks analyst, LPL Financial will keep expanding through acquisitions driven a solid balance sheet position. Higher rates, solid advisor productivity and recruiting efforts will aid revenues.Diversified Portfolio and Strengthening Backlog Aid FLEXPer the Zacks analyst, Flex's performance benefited from strong revenue growth across all business segments owing to ongoing secular trends.

(NYSE:TMO) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Thermo Fisher ScientificThe Executive VP &amp; COO, Michel Lagarde, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$542 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$541. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in Thermo Fisher Scientific didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Thermo Fisher Scientific Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Thermo Fisher Scientific. In total, Independent Director Debora Spar sold US$112k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of Thermo Fisher ScientificLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$302m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Thermo Fisher Scientific Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

6,30980c3c-e021-3b40-a0bb-1a310036a485,CF,2022-12-24,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-cf-industries-140002778.html,1671804002,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -15.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.3% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which CF belongs, has lost 12.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, CF is expected to post earnings of $4.31 per share, indicating a change of +16.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $16.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +279.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.11 indicates a change of -6% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CF is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $2.86 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.5%. The $11.44 billion and $9.82 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +74.9% and -14.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.4%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was -20.06%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

7,b5189a9c-e2dd-359f-a44f-e989d5bdcdb4,CTAS,2022-12-24,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Cintas (CTAS),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-174505760.html,1671817505,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Cintas (CTAS) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this uniform rental company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Cintas is 17.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 9.3%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Cintas is 6.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -0.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 18.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Cintas. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.4% over the past month.Bottom LineCintas has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Cintas is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.59%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.53%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.45%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest retailer had lost 5.87% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 4.56% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.33% in that time.Walmart will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Walmart to post earnings of $1.50 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.96%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $158.81 billion, up 3.88% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.08 per share and revenue of $605.64 billion, which would represent changes of -5.88% and +5.74%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Walmart. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.03% higher. Walmart is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Walmart currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 23.61.

(NYSE:JWN) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript November 22, 2022Nordstrom, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.2, expectations were $0.13.Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Nordstrom Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will begin with prepared remarks, followed by a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Heather Hollander, Head of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may now begin.Heather Hollander: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to mention that we'll be referring to slides, which can be viewed in the Investor Relations section on nordstrom.com. Our discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slide with our Safe Harbor language. Participating in today's call are Erik Nordstrom, Chief Executive Officer; Pete Nordstrom, President and Chief Brand Officer; Anne Bramman, Chief Financial Officer, and Michael Maher, Chief Accounting Officer, who will provide a business update and discuss the company's third quarter performance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Erik.Photo by Christin Hume on UnsplashErik Nordstrom: Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. For the third quarter, we delivered results in line with our expectations with quarterly net sales of $3.4 billion, a loss per share of $0.13 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.20. As we discussed, while reporting our second quarter results, we saw customer demand begin to soften in late June, mostly in Nordstrom Rack. Across both banners, the softening trend was more significant in customer segments with the lowest income profiles, while we saw greater resilience in the higher income cohorts. As customer trends shifted, we took action to manage through the short-term macroeconomic uncertainty and position our business for success.Story continuesThis included managing expenses to align with sales expectations and clearing through excess inventory to exit the year with healthy inventory levels and mix. These actions prepared us well for the third quarter, as macroeconomic pressures impacted all customer segments, with outsized impact in the lowest income groups. Additionally, sales decelerated in late October and early November, particularly in geographies with unseasonably warm weather. In the last two weeks, however, sales trends have improved. Our teams have executed well in a challenging environment this quarter and continued to advance our closer-to-use strategy. Given ongoing inflationary pressures in supply chain and fulfillment, we are particularly pleased that we decreased our variable supply chain cost this quarter.Our supply chain optimization work streams drove efficiency and lowered the per unit cost of moving product through our system, while also delivering an improved customer experience and faster order fulfillment. We're also on track with our plans to clear through excess inventory and optimize our product mix. Net sales decreased 3% versus last year, which includes a negative impact of approximately 200 basis points from one week of the Anniversary Sale's shifting into the second quarter. Nordstrom banner sales and gross merchandise value, or GMV, each decreased 3% versus last year. The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale had a negative impact on Nordstrom banner net sales of approximately 300 basis points. In the third quarter, customers continued to refresh their wardrobes and shop for occasions such as social events, travel, work and holidays, which drove demand for our core categories and services.Consistent with the second quarter, items with lower AURs underperformed higher AUR items. Customers continue to respond very positively to newness and fashion in our seasonal assortment. Turning now to our strategic initiatives. Our team remains focused on improving Rack performance, increasing profitability and optimizing our supply chain and inventory flow. We're making progress in these initiatives and we expect them to benefit our top line and bottom line performance in the fourth quarter of this year, in 2023 and beyond. While we take actions to address a shifting consumer backdrop, we are also building capabilities to better serve customers and deliver increased profitability, as we focus on improving Nordstrom Rack performance, winning in our most important markets and leveraging our digital capabilities.Starting with Nordstrom Rack. Sales declined 2% versus last year as we continued to see softening demand, especially within our lower income customer groups. We remain focused on delivering profitable growth while improving the customer experience. To that end, this quarter, we made the decision to reduce Rack store-based order fulfillment and raised the minimum order amount to receive free ship-to-store delivery on rack.com. These actions reduced our order cancellations, simplified rack operations and improved profitability, but negatively impacted top line growth at the Rack by approximately 200 basis points. We continue to focus on increasing our supply of premium brands at Rack, improving our assortment and growing brand awareness to fuel future growth.Premium brands are a differentiator for the Rack, and we are dedicated to having great brands at great prices at each of our locations. The linkage to the Nordstrom banner gives Nordstrom Rack unique access to premium brands that are not broadly available in the off-price space. For example, 90% of the top brands at Nordstrom are sold at Nordstrom Rack. This quarter, sales of our top 100 brands at the Rack increased 9%, which underscores the growth opportunity from increasing our supply of premium brands. We are also continuing to shift away from the lower price point items that have not resonated with Rack customers. We expect to clear through this inventory by the end of the fiscal year, which opens more space and buying capacity for premium brands.With the work underway, we expect to optimize Rack product mix by mid-2023. We believe that improving our assortment and increasing penetration of top brands will differentiate the Rack experience for customers and drive profitable sales growth. Next, our market capabilities help us engage with customers by delivering convenience, connection and greater access to product, no matter how they choose to shop. Customers clearly value our interconnected model with a strong store fleet, two unique banners and omnichannel capabilities linked at the market level. Order pickup represented 12% of nordstrom.com demand this quarter, an increase of 200 basis points versus last year. We are also leveraging our digital capabilities to extend our unmatched one-to-one store experience to a digital world.Our goal is to personalize the digital experience with discovery supported by a broad product assortment, convenience powered by our market strategy and connection via our people and experiences. We are evolving digital discovery and driving higher engagement with enhanced content, a refreshed shopping experience that includes redesigned product pages and smarter product search capabilities. We are also improving the digital purchase journey with better imagery and product descriptions to help customers make more informed purchase decisions and minimize returns. Total digital sales declined 16% this quarter, which includes a negative impact of approximately 300 basis points from the anniversary sales shift. Additionally, reducing store-based fulfillment for rack.com orders and sunsetting Trunk Club negatively impacted digital sales by approximately 700 basis points, with the change to rack.com store fulfillment accounting for the majority of the impact.Our digital sales were also affected by channel shift as customers return to pre-pandemic shopping behavior and increasingly chose to shop in-store this quarter. Digital sales represented 34% of total sales during the quarter. Before I turn it over to Pete, we'd like to thank our employees, customers and partners for helping kids start off the school year on the right foot. For the 12th year, we partnered with Nike and shoes that fit to donate more than 40,000 pairs of brand new shoes to kids in need for back-to-school. This program leverages our heritage and shoes and engages our teams and customers to make a difference in their communities. We're very proud of the incredible support our team and customers put behind this important cause. In closing, though there is continued macro uncertainty, we are pleased with the actions we've taken to prepare for this environment and the progress we've made in improving our agility.The capabilities we built with our closer-to-use strategy, digital assets and supply chain optimization prepare us to manage short-term pressures. With our strong balance sheet and cash position, we also have the flexibility to respond to shifting demand. We are navigating short-term headwinds while also continuing to build capabilities to better serve our customers, drive profitable growth and increase shareholder value. We are focused on remaining nimble to navigate this environment and look forward to realizing additional benefits in the fourth quarter and into 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Pete.Pete Nordstrom: Thanks, Erik. I'll begin by talking about our category performance, then I'll discuss the actions we're taking to ensure healthy inventory levels and mix going into next year. Finally, I'll update you on the progress we are making to improve supply chain and inventory flow and increase gross margin. Starting with the category performance. Men's and women's apparel, shoes and designer had the strongest growth in the quarter versus last year. Customers continue to shop for occasions and return to the office and update their closets. We continue to see softness versus last year in categories previously accelerated by the pandemic, including home and active. Turning now to inventory. As you know, we have been taking aggressive action to align inventory with softening demand and category shifts.We have been focusing on improving our assortment by clearing through product that customers weren't responding to and showcasing the fashion, newness and categories they want. While this clearance activity pressures margins in the near-term, the impact is in line with our expectations and consistent with the outlook we shared with you last quarter. Importantly, we expect to have healthy and current inventory by the end of the year. setting us up for longer-term growth and profitability. In addition to healthy inventory levels, we are also focused on having the right composition of inventory. We are maintaining a strong inflow of exciting brands to deliver the newness customers expect from us. We continue to partner with new limited distribution brands to grow their businesses and offer our customers increased selection.For example, our partnerships with On Running, SKIMS and Fear of God illustrate our strategy and effectiveness in amplifying exciting new brands. These partnerships only began a few years ago, and now they're among Nordstrom's top five fastest growing brands and ranked in our top brands overall. We also continue to focus on improving our supply chain and inventory flow. Last year, in response to our growing digital business and increasing inflationary cost pressure, we launched a series of work streams to drive efficiency and reduce supply chain costs while also elevating the customer experience. Improved inventory flow is a key component of this work and an integral part of our Closer to You strategy. By optimizing our supply chain, we are able to provide our customers with greater selection and faster delivery speeds.We're reducing the number of product touch points through our network, which decreases our cost and gets the product in a sellable position faster, which improves our regular price sell-through. As part of our supply chain optimization efforts, we are also continuing to increase productivity in our distribution and fulfillment centers and improving the consistency of unit flow through our network. We are very pleased with the early results we're seeing from this work. While we evaluate many supply chain metrics, for our customer, we believe the most important metric is click-to-deliver speed. This quarter, we improved click-to-deliver speed by 15%. As we improved unit flow through our network, we increased fulfillment center flow through by 28% versus last year and reduced our variable handling cost per unit by 3%.In fact, despite inflationary pressures this quarter, we decreased our variable supply chain cost as a percent of sales by approximately 100 basis points, compared to last year. As we advance our supply chain capabilities, we are also aligning our network accordingly. To that end, we closed a smaller omnichannel fulfillment center in Los Angeles that is no longer needed and retired the third-party technology tested in that center, as we have scaled our West Coast Omnichannel Center to support the demand in that region. In addition to supply chain optimization, we continue to focus on expanding our merchandise margins over the long-term. One of the most important levers in improving merchandise margin is faster inventory turns. We are committed to delivering a double-digit percentage increase in inventory turns in 2023.In addition to faster inventory turns, we are also working to improve merchandise margins by leveraging advanced analytics to identify customer needs, improve our assortment, increase promotional effectiveness, and optimize markdowns. We saw the benefits of this work in the first half of the year and expect to deliver additional merchandise margin improvements once we are past the clearance markdown pressure this year. Turning now to holiday, our customers are excited for the season, and we are well-positioned with a fresh, relevant assortment to help them get ready for their celebrations. We've used our learnings from past holiday events to improve our offering with the goal of being the go-to destination for gifting and preparing for the moments that matter to our customers.In closing, we are taking actions to clear through excess inventory, improve our mix and assortment, increase our agility, and enter 2023 in a healthy inventory position. We're confident in our ability to build on our progress in driving supply chain efficiencies and the additional benefits we expect in the fourth quarter and in 2023. Now I'll turn it back to Erik.Erik Nordstrom: As we announced last month, Anne Bramman will be stepping down from her role as CFO on December 2nd. We'd like to take a moment to recognize Anne for her dedication to our customers, our employees, our shareholders, and our values. Anne made significant contributions to our business over the last five years, including helping to successfully guide the company through the pandemic, sponsoring multiple strategic initiatives to improve profitability, and elevating the finance organization. So, Anne, we thank you for your partnership and leadership. We wish you all the best in your next step.Anne Bramman: Thank you, Erik. It's been a privilege to work alongside you, our executive leadership team, our Board of Directors, and all of the incredible people who make Nordstrom such a special place. It has been an honor to be a part of this company. I'll now review our third quarter results, and then turn it over to Michael Maher, who will serve as our interim CFO beginning December 5th, to address our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.13. After excluding charges related to a supply chain technology and related asset impairment, adjusted earnings per share was $0.20. Overall, net sales decreased 3%, in line with our expectations. This includes a negative impact of approximately 200 basis points due to one week of the anniversary sales shifting into the second quarter.GMV decreased 2%. Nordstrom banner sales and GMV each decreased 3% versus last year. Anniversary sale timing negatively impacted the Nordstrom banner by approximately 300 basis points. Nordstrom Rack sales decreased 2% in the third quarter. Digital sales decreased 16% this quarter. Digital sales include a 1,000 basis point impact from anniversary sale timing shift, reducing racks or fulfill and sunsetting Trunk Club. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 190 basis points, primarily due to higher markdown rates on clearance product. Consistent with our expectations from the end of the second quarter, we realized approximately $100 million of incremental markdowns during the third quarter. As Erik and Pete described, we have taken actions to right-size our inventory and as such, ending inventory increased 1% this quarter versus a 3% decrease in sales.As a result of reduced supply chain backlogs, we had a higher percentage of our inventory on hand this year versus in transit last year. We continue to expect that we will end the year in a healthy inventory position and are committed to a disciplined approach to inventory management in 2023. Total SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales increased 200 basis points due to a supply chain technology and related asset impairment charge, partially offset by leverage driven by fulfillment expense efficiencies. Excluding the impact of the impairment, total SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales remained flat with the prior year. Since last year, we've been making progress on our supply chain optimization initiatives to offset anticipated labor and fulfillment cost pressure, and we're pleased with the results we're seeing.We continue to expect that these initiatives will deliver more significant benefits in the fourth quarter and in 2023. EBIT margin was 0.1% of sales for the third quarter. After excluding charges related to the impairment, adjusted EBIT margin was 2.1%. We maintained a solid financial position, ending the third quarter with $993 million in available liquidity, including $293 million in cash. Subsequent to quarter end, we paid off the $100 million we had borrowed on our revolving line of credit and once again have the entire balance available to us. Finally, we are pleased to announce the extension of our credit card program agreement with TD Bank as the exclusive issuer of our proprietary Nordstrom branded credit card. TD has been a strong partner and we look forward to working with them to further enhance the card member experience.I'll now hand it over to Michael to talk through our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022.See also Top 20 Industries in the World and Agriculture Stocks List: 25 Biggest Companies.Michael Maher: Thanks, Anne. And before I discuss our outlook, I just want to briefly add a word of appreciation on behalf of the finance team here at Nordstrom. We've the past few years. Thank you for everything and all the best in your next chapter. Now, I'll describe the macroeconomic backdrop contemplated in our guidance for the balance of the year. As Erik indicated, macroeconomic pressures impacted demand across all customer segments in the third quarter, with the most significant impact in the lowest income groups. However, customers continue to refresh their wardrobes, shop for occasions, and respond to fashion and newness in our assortment. With regard to recent trends, sales softened in late October and early November, but improved in the last two weeks.We believe that unseasonably warm temperatures in certain geographies contributed to the decelerating trends, along with delayed holiday shopping. As weather normalized and we get closer to the holidays, we've seen sales trends improve and gifting activity accelerate. As for holiday shopping expectations, we believe that this year's calendar, which has an extra Saturday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, will lead some customers to wait until closer to Christmas to make their purchases. We continue to expect an elevated promotional environment across retail in the fourth quarter. Taking these factors into consideration, we are reaffirming our 2022 financial outlook. For fiscal year 2022, we continue to expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% versus 2021.We expect adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 4.3% to 4.7% for the full year. Our forecast assumes that EBIT margin improvement for the year will be driven by SG&amp;A leverage, with gross profit roughly flat for the full year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27% for the fiscal year. We expect adjusted EPS of $2.30 to $2.60. Our outlook excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We continue to expect approximately $100 million of incremental markdown impacts from clearance activity in the fourth quarter. Though we are facing inflationary expense pressures, we contemplated that pressure in our outlook, along with the increasing benefits of our supply chain optimization initiatives. With regard to the assumptions embedded in our guidance range, the low end of our guidance assumes that the softer sales trends from late October and early November return, and promotional activity in the sector increases above what we've seen to date.The high end of our guidance assumes that holiday sales will accelerate year-over-year as we approach Christmas, in line with pre-pandemic shopping behavior, and that promotional levels in the sector are consistent with what we've seen to date. Shifting to capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in the business to better serve our customers and support long-term growth. We're planning capital expenditures at normalized levels of 3% to 4% of net sales as we continue to invest in supply chain and technology capabilities. Our second priority is reducing our leverage. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and expect to decrease our leverage ratio below 2.9 times by the end of 2022.We continue to target a leverage ratio below 2.5 times. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. Last week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share. Year-to-date, we also repurchased approximately $53 million of our stock at an average price of $23 per share. We have approximately $447 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to take a measured approach to share repurchases through the remainder of this year, aligning with our cash flow and market conditions. In closing, we've been taking the necessary steps to prepare for a softening macroeconomic backdrop and are confident that we have the financial strength and strategic capabilities to manage through a rapidly evolving environment.We have a strong balance sheet and a favorable debt maturity schedule. We're reducing our inventory levels to enter 2023 in a healthy and current position and improve our flexibility and agility. Despite markdown and inflationary pressures, we still expect to deliver SG&amp;A benefits from our supply chain optimization work and disciplined expense management and significantly increase our year-over-year profitability in the fourth quarter. With that, Heather, we're ready for questions.Heather Hollander: Thank you, Michael.

(NYSE:MMC) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Dean Klisura, for US$1.5m worth of shares, at about US$172 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$166. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shares. In total, insiders dumped US$2.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own about US$200m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

QuoteEntegris New Manufacturing Facility to Boost ProspectsThe entire tech industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to a number of macroeconomic turmoils, like raging inflation, forex market volatility and looming recession.This has been reflected in the share price movement of various tech stocks like Entegris and as investors hold bearish sentiments about the entire industry.Entegris’ shares, which currently carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), have lost 53.5% in the year-to-date (YTD) period compared with the Zacks Electronics - Manufacturing Machinery industry decline of 41.5%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, Entegris, which manufactures electronic materials for the semiconductor market, is facing increasing demand for its capex-driven solutions like fluid handling, FOUPS, gas filtration and purification products, which grew more than 50% in the last-reported quarter.Another major factor positively impacting Entegris’ decision to expand manufacturing operations in the United States is President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act, supporting investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China and Japan. Major semiconductor stocks like onsemi ON and Microchip Technology MCHP are also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.Story continuesonsemi recently expanded its Hudson, NH facility, which will increase SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year. This will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure and is an important contributor to decarbonization. onsemi, however, signed long-term supply agreements with various customers for the next three years, which is expected to help secure $1 billion of committed SiC revenues in 2023.The government's recent declaration will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances. Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.The recent positive political environment in the United States to support domestic manufacturing supported by the Chips and Science act is positively impacting the share price movement of Entegris peer Axcelis Technologies ACLS, specifically operating in the semiconductor industry.Entegris’ peer in the Electronics Manufacturing Machinery industry, Axcelis’ shares have risen 7.9% YTD, reflecting the bullish sentiments in the industry.Entegris’ recent expansion of its manufacturing facility in the United States will help the company in hedging its business operations against forex volatility and help in expanding its supply-chain efficiency and addressing the industry’s long-term capacity constraints.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

17,cb0bf705-8cf9-38bf-8188-bdb850100980,MCHP,2022-12-24,Can Value Investors Select Microchip Technology (MCHP) Stock Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-select-microchip-technology-162204094.html,1671812524,STORY,['MCHP'],"[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Microchip Technology Incorporated MCHP stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Microchip Technology has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.82, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 17.4. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Microchip Technology’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint (which is 17.73) over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.05. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that Microchip Technology has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.77, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Microchip Technology stock in the near term too.PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important, it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well. One can easily do that with the PEG ratio (ratio of the P/E to the expected future earnings growth rate).The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P/E ratio.Microchip Technology’s PEG ratio stands at just 0.76, compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini industry average of 0.88. This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBroad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Microchip Technology currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Microchip Technology a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.77, which is far better than the industry average of 11.30. Clearly, MCHP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Microchip Technology might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D. This gives MCHP a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been robust at best. The current quarter has seen nine estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen ten up and none down in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 6.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 4.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and ConsensusMicrochip Technology Incorporated Price and ConsensusMicrochip Technology Incorporated price-consensus-chart | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteThis somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMicrochip Technology is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 20% of more than 250 industries), it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nevertheless, over the past two years, the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is key to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's plan to make the country self-sufficient in gasoline and diesel, ending longstanding heavy dependence on imports, mainly from U.S. refiners.Describing the construction of the refinery in his home state, Tabasco, as having happened in ""world record time,"" Lopez Obrador said ""on July 1, it will begin to process 170,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil.""By September 15, the day before Mexican Independence Day, it would process its full capacity of 340,000 bpd and yield 280,000 bpd of gasoline and diesel, Lopez Obrador said, posting on Twitter.The president did not specify whether the refinery would produce gasoline or diesel before July 1 or whether the date would mark the first barrels of crude processed there.Last July, at the Gulf Coast facility's symbolic inauguration, Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said the first barrel of fuel from Olmeca would be produced this month, December.The president has put run Pemex at the center of his energy agenda, even as critics have questioned the economic logic of the new facility, the cost of which was initially budgeted at about $8 billion but has since ballooned to more than $15.4 billion.The Olmeca refinery has been one of the leftist president's signature public works projects since he took office in late 2018.

22,dd9f8461-b8a1-3dae-9490-2af3fc143c32,O,2022-12-24,Investors Shouldn't Overlook Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's (KLSE:HIBISCS) Impressive Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-shouldnt-overlook-hibiscus-petroleum-234935446.html,1671839375,STORY,['CL=F'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:HIBISCS) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = RM931m ÷ (RM5.7b - RM1.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad has an ROCE of 23%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad roceIn the above chart we have measured Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEHibiscus Petroleum Berhad is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 23%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 238%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.Story continuesOn a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. Essentially the business now has suppliers or short-term creditors funding about 28% of its operations, which isn't ideal. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.In Conclusion...In summary, it's great to see that Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Considering the stock has delivered 25% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.One more thing: We've identified   2 warning signs  with Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad is not the only stock earning high returns.

Oil trading, we can see that's up about $2.70-- or 2.76% today, up about $2.00 and change. Just closing in on that $80 per barrel price level.Now we have Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Training Academy joining us. And, Scott, I was just reeling off the latest price of oil here. We bounced off $70. Now that's basis WTI here. We had-- and I think that was earlier in the month when we were first getting those actual sanctions by Russia pegged-- I guess plowed on, and now we really didn't see much of the way in negative price action from there. In fact, we're up about $8. Just wondering how you're viewing the oil market in response to this latest news.SCOTT BAUER: Yeah, I have been bullish oil ever since we've started dropping below $100 and buying it on every dip, selling it on any sort of rally here. I've had to get stopped out a couple of times, but $70, $71, Jared, that really, to me, is a short-term bottom. When I say short term, I'm saying at least six months.The floor is put in for a number of reasons. First off, that's where, you know, the administration has said we're going to replenish SPR if we get down there. So to me, that is somewhat of a floor.Also, I think there's just still a tremendous amount of tailwinds in the space here. Number one, as it has been for me all year is what's going on in Russia/Ukraine. Number two is what's going on in China, and I believe that we-- the oil market, anyway, has seen the worst-case scenario in terms of demand, in terms of lockdowns, even with the latest, you know, policy that they've talked about with kind of opening back up and people getting COVID. I think we've seen the worst in terms of demand. It's only going to get higher from here.Story continuesSo there are just a bunch of tailwinds, and that $70 number to me, because of the SPR, that absolutely is a floor.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, President Biden talked about buying oil at $70 per barrel for the SPR to replenish it from those-- from the lower levels that it's fallen to.Now you mentioned the double whammy this year, and we were talking about price bottoms. What about a ceiling? What would it take to see a ceiling in terms of the news flow, in terms of price action? What are you thinking about as you think about those upper targets here?SCOTT BAUER: It absolutely would not surprise me to see oil back in the $90s with a nine handle. To break $100, though, I think is going to be a real tough job. I just don't see any scenario other than-- other than some more major geopolitical conflict that we're going to see oil just get to those prices again. And listen, that's not out of the question-- out of the question, unfortunately. That can happen. But I think this range of the low $70s probably to the mid $90s is somewhere we're going to be for, you know, at least the first and second quarter of the year.JARED BLIKRE: All right, and what about natural gas and some of the other elements to the energy sector? We've seen natural gas prices drop off quite precipitously. That has its own supply-and-demand aspects, but maybe you can just comment on that market a little bit.SCOTT BAUER: It absolutely does. And, in fact, if you're looking at what's going on in Russia right now and the news that they announced that they might be pulling back production here, that is really just for crude and oil products. It is not for natural gas.So I know that, especially in Europe, there has been a shortage. But right now, I'm not going to say it's fine, but the natural-gas supply right now is not as dire, if you will, as what we're seeing on the crude side. And again, if we turn back to Russia, 40%-- almost 40% of all of their export revenues are from the oil space, not from natural gas.So natural gas is still flowing. I don't see that we're going to get a major, major spike again, certainly not to where we were. UMG, which I track very closely, is trading right around $15 and 1/2, $16 right now, which is a low we've seen in probably three, four months. That was as high as the mid $30s just a couple months ago. Maybe we see a 15%, 20% pop in natural gas from here just because of this massive selloff that we've had, but I don't think that we're going to get into the crunch like we might get with crude [AUDIO OUT].JARED BLIKRE: Well, we've been talking about the Russian-- I guess the Russian effect on crude-oil supplies. It seems to me when we-- this doesn't-- this hasn't had necessarily bearish price-action consequences when we talk about crude oil this year, and I think part of it comes from the fact that we have dark supplies so that you never see oil taken off the market considerably. You see a market-clearing price. So at some price, somebody is going to take Russian oil off the market.Just wondering, with all the sanctions in place, with all the eyeballs on this, what are the potentials for violations of that next year? What are some of the situations that could evolve that could actually be bearish for the price of energy that might not be factored in right now?SCOTT BAUER: So in all honesty, there's probably violations going on right now, and there will continue [AUDIO OUT] violations going on. Some of that's just going to be-- let's call it glanced over. But we're not going to see, in my opinion, the price get much below $60, which is that price cap there. Maybe we'll see it a little bit. But that is a number that the G-7 came up with to hopefully reduce Russian export revenue but a price high enough to keep it flowing to the market.So yes, there's always, always, you know, some underhanded deals out there. And when you're looking at, really, the four countries that are really still in the market buying Russian oil, you're looking at Bulgaria, China, India, and Turkey. You've got to think that there's [AUDIO OUT] be some violation there.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, well, I love doing a deep dive on the oil market and the futures markets on the day before Christmas Eve here. Thank you for joining us, Scott Bauer.]"

""It's increasingly important to prevent and mitigate risks associated with ESG, including, of course, climate change.""While the business plan reiterated promises made by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to reduce Pemex's emissions, it focused on oil and gas production and exploration as well as refining rather than shifting toward renewables.Lopez Obrador says he inherited a company weakened by decades of mismanagement and corruption under his predecessors. Even so, his energy policies have limited participation by private companies that could bring in funds.This year, Pemex has come under increased pressure to reduce the vast amounts of natural gas it burns off - including at two of its top priority fields, Ixachi and Quesqui - to the detriment of the environment.

However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines is:4.6% = US$4.4m ÷ US$97m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every CA$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated CA$0.05 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' Earnings Growth And 4.6% ROEOn the face of it, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 12%. For this reason, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' five year net income decline of 26% is not surprising given its lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 32% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

It is key to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's plan to make the country self-sufficient in gasoline and diesel, ending longstanding heavy dependence on imports, mainly from U.S. refiners.Describing the construction of the refinery in his home state, Tabasco, as having happened in ""world record time,"" Lopez Obrador said ""on July 1, it will begin to process 170,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil.""By September 15, the day before Mexican Independence Day, it would process its full capacity of 340,000 bpd and yield 280,000 bpd of gasoline and diesel, Lopez Obrador said, posting on Twitter.The president did not specify whether the refinery would produce gasoline or diesel before July 1 or whether the date would mark the first barrels of crude processed there.Last July, at the Gulf Coast facility's symbolic inauguration, Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said the first barrel of fuel from Olmeca would be produced this month, December.The president has put run Pemex at the center of his energy agenda, even as critics have questioned the economic logic of the new facility, the cost of which was initially budgeted at about $8 billion but has since ballooned to more than $15.4 billion.The Olmeca refinery has been one of the leftist president's signature public works projects since he took office in late 2018.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:HIBISCS) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = RM931m ÷ (RM5.7b - RM1.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad has an ROCE of 23%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad roceIn the above chart we have measured Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEHibiscus Petroleum Berhad is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 23%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 238%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.Story continuesOn a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. Essentially the business now has suppliers or short-term creditors funding about 28% of its operations, which isn't ideal. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.In Conclusion...In summary, it's great to see that Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Considering the stock has delivered 25% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.One more thing: We've identified   2 warning signs  with Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad is not the only stock earning high returns.

""There was nowhere to hide.""A slew of data from the Commerce Department and the University of Michigan showed that while inflation appears to be cooling, so is consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the U.S. economy.On the other hand, new home sales posted a surprise gain and consumer sentiment brightened.But the data did little to move the needle regarding Fed policy expectations.""Inflation looks fairly sticky and interest rates keep mounting up,"" Kim said.

This made up 86% of the country's $2.673 billion target for 2022, Ordonez added.The figures include sales from the Mirador copper mine, owned by EcuaCorriente, a subsidiary of the Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan Investment, and gold exports from Canada's Lundin Gold's Fruta del Norte, as well as small-scale mining.The government expects four major mining projects will begin operations by the end of President Guillermo Lasso's term in 2025, including the Cascabel project, held by Australia's SolGold.

Oil trading, we can see that's up about $2.70-- or 2.76% today, up about $2.00 and change. Just closing in on that $80 per barrel price level.Now we have Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Training Academy joining us. And, Scott, I was just reeling off the latest price of oil here. We bounced off $70. Now that's basis WTI here. We had-- and I think that was earlier in the month when we were first getting those actual sanctions by Russia pegged-- I guess plowed on, and now we really didn't see much of the way in negative price action from there. In fact, we're up about $8. Just wondering how you're viewing the oil market in response to this latest news.SCOTT BAUER: Yeah, I have been bullish oil ever since we've started dropping below $100 and buying it on every dip, selling it on any sort of rally here. I've had to get stopped out a couple of times, but $70, $71, Jared, that really, to me, is a short-term bottom. When I say short term, I'm saying at least six months.The floor is put in for a number of reasons. First off, that's where, you know, the administration has said we're going to replenish SPR if we get down there. So to me, that is somewhat of a floor.Also, I think there's just still a tremendous amount of tailwinds in the space here. Number one, as it has been for me all year is what's going on in Russia/Ukraine. Number two is what's going on in China, and I believe that we-- the oil market, anyway, has seen the worst-case scenario in terms of demand, in terms of lockdowns, even with the latest, you know, policy that they've talked about with kind of opening back up and people getting COVID. I think we've seen the worst in terms of demand. It's only going to get higher from here.Story continuesSo there are just a bunch of tailwinds, and that $70 number to me, because of the SPR, that absolutely is a floor.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, President Biden talked about buying oil at $70 per barrel for the SPR to replenish it from those-- from the lower levels that it's fallen to.Now you mentioned the double whammy this year, and we were talking about price bottoms. What about a ceiling? What would it take to see a ceiling in terms of the news flow, in terms of price action? What are you thinking about as you think about those upper targets here?SCOTT BAUER: It absolutely would not surprise me to see oil back in the $90s with a nine handle. To break $100, though, I think is going to be a real tough job. I just don't see any scenario other than-- other than some more major geopolitical conflict that we're going to see oil just get to those prices again. And listen, that's not out of the question-- out of the question, unfortunately. That can happen. But I think this range of the low $70s probably to the mid $90s is somewhere we're going to be for, you know, at least the first and second quarter of the year.JARED BLIKRE: All right, and what about natural gas and some of the other elements to the energy sector? We've seen natural gas prices drop off quite precipitously. That has its own supply-and-demand aspects, but maybe you can just comment on that market a little bit.SCOTT BAUER: It absolutely does. And, in fact, if you're looking at what's going on in Russia right now and the news that they announced that they might be pulling back production here, that is really just for crude and oil products. It is not for natural gas.So I know that, especially in Europe, there has been a shortage. But right now, I'm not going to say it's fine, but the natural-gas supply right now is not as dire, if you will, as what we're seeing on the crude side. And again, if we turn back to Russia, 40%-- almost 40% of all of their export revenues are from the oil space, not from natural gas.So natural gas is still flowing. I don't see that we're going to get a major, major spike again, certainly not to where we were. UMG, which I track very closely, is trading right around $15 and 1/2, $16 right now, which is a low we've seen in probably three, four months. That was as high as the mid $30s just a couple months ago. Maybe we see a 15%, 20% pop in natural gas from here just because of this massive selloff that we've had, but I don't think that we're going to get into the crunch like we might get with crude [AUDIO OUT].JARED BLIKRE: Well, we've been talking about the Russian-- I guess the Russian effect on crude-oil supplies. It seems to me when we-- this doesn't-- this hasn't had necessarily bearish price-action consequences when we talk about crude oil this year, and I think part of it comes from the fact that we have dark supplies so that you never see oil taken off the market considerably. You see a market-clearing price. So at some price, somebody is going to take Russian oil off the market.Just wondering, with all the sanctions in place, with all the eyeballs on this, what are the potentials for violations of that next year? What are some of the situations that could evolve that could actually be bearish for the price of energy that might not be factored in right now?SCOTT BAUER: So in all honesty, there's probably violations going on right now, and there will continue [AUDIO OUT] violations going on. Some of that's just going to be-- let's call it glanced over. But we're not going to see, in my opinion, the price get much below $60, which is that price cap there. Maybe we'll see it a little bit. But that is a number that the G-7 came up with to hopefully reduce Russian export revenue but a price high enough to keep it flowing to the market.So yes, there's always, always, you know, some underhanded deals out there. And when you're looking at, really, the four countries that are really still in the market buying Russian oil, you're looking at Bulgaria, China, India, and Turkey.

You Have Four Days Left,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interested-ralph-laurens-nyse-rl-123217781.html,1671885137,STORY,['RL'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Ralph Lauren's shares on or after the 29th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of January.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.00 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Ralph Lauren has a trailing yield of 2.9% on the current stock price of $104.36. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Ralph Lauren's payout ratio is modest, at just 39% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Ralph Lauren generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year, it paid out dividends equivalent to 300% of what it generated in free cash flow, a disturbingly high percentage. Our definition of free cash flow excludes cash generated from asset sales, so since Ralph Lauren is paying out such a high percentage of its cash flow, it might be worth seeing if it sold assets or had similar events that might have led to such a high dividend payment.Story continuesRalph Lauren paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Ralph Lauren's ability to maintain its dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Ralph Lauren's earnings per share have risen 17% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Ralph Lauren has delivered an average of 14% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineIs Ralph Lauren an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We're glad to see the company has been improving its earnings per share while also paying out a low percentage of income. However, it's not great to see it paying out what we see as an uncomfortably high percentage of its cash flow. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Ralph Lauren from a dividend perspective.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Ralph Lauren is facing. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Ralph Lauren that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Axios reporting Bloomberg is eyeing either ""Wall Street Journal"" parent company Dow Jones or the ""Washington Post,"" which is currently owned by Jeff Bezos.Allie Canal joining us now with the latest. Allie, what are we learning?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, that's right, David. According to this Axios report, Bloomberg is most interested in that Dow Jones acquisition due to its all-encompassing business coverage. You mentioned how Dow Jones is the parent company of the ""Wall Street Journal"" but also ""Barron's"" and MarketWatch. So pretty notable franchises there, especially within the finance world. However, the report did indicate that Bloomberg would be willing to purchase the ""Washington Post"" if Bezos was willing to sell.Yahoo Finance did reach out to both Dow Jones and the ""Washington Post."" A spokesperson for Dow Jones declined to comment, and the ""Post"" did not immediately respond.But another interesting layer to this story is the relationship between Michael Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch owns News Corp, which is the parent company of Dow Jones. He is close with Bloomberg. And we did receive a report back in October that Murdoch was considering a recombination of News Corp and Fox, which last split in 2013. Bloomberg, though, at least according to Axios, believes this recombination will fail, thus creating a possible opening, although he reportedly has not yet spoken to Murdoch about his interest.So it seems like this is still very early days but definitely something to watch heading into 2023.JARED BLIKRE: And, Allie, thinking about what else in the M&amp;A space may happen in media in 2023, just wondering what's on your radar? Because if I think back over the last 20 years, it seems like there's a major reshuffling about once every 10 years. That kind of occurs with the business cycle. You see a bunch of combinations, a bunch of split ups. What are we seeing for the new year?Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: I think we're definitely entering that period, Jared. There are signs that there's going to be more mergers and acquisitions in 2023. We've seen this push to profits, increased competition, companies just bleeding money, especially those traditional print entities, and M&amp;A is often looked at as a viable solution to those problems. Of course, the interest-rate environment, that could create some headwinds. But Wall Street is going to be on all of these companies' tails amid that profitability push.So other possible acquisitions to look out for could include Paramount Global unloading along with some of those smaller players like WWE, Curiosity Stream, Chicken Soup for the Soul, and then Disney. What are they going to do with Hulu and ESPN?So there is certainly a reckoning across the industry. The stock market has wiped $500 billion plus off of the media sector this year alone, and everything's on the table when it comes to this industry to try to recover from that and survive in the new year.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Allie Canal, good to see you. Thanks so much.]"

The Journal has a Special Committee, set up under an agreement with its former owners, designed to safeguard editorial independence and ethical standards.Story continuesMr Bloomberg’s interest comes shortly after the British editor of the Sunday Times, Emma Tucker, was appointed to the top job at the Wall Street Journal, marking a further strengthening of ties between Mr Murdoch’s UK and US businesses.The move has also fuelled speculation that Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News UK, is being lined up for a senior role in the US.A takeover of the Wall Street Journal would underline efforts by Mr Bloomberg to build on his empire’s media offering and move away from its reliance on income from the Bloomberg Terminals used by traders.Subscriptions to the Terminal, which offers data, news and analysis to financial professionals, make up the majority of Bloomberg’s annual revenue of more than $10bn.The company would be able to integrate any takeover target with Bloomberg Media, its existing news outlet focused on business reporting.Bloomberg has previously beefed up its coverage by acquiring specialist news titles and market data providers.Mr Bloomberg would also consider buying The Washington Post from the Amazon founder Mr Bezos if it were up for sale, Axios reported.The Washington Post would represent a less natural fit for Mr Bloomberg, although a takeover would help to boost the organisation’s political coverage.The Post has said it will cut up to 250 jobs next year as it struggles to retain subscribers after enjoying a period of heightened popularity during Donald Trump’s presidency.A spokesman for The Washington Post said: “The Post is not for sale.”A Bloomberg spokesman dismissed the speculation and said “there is nothing to comment on”.News Corp declined to comment.]"

Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley has been following the story and joins us now. It has been an uphill battle so far.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, that's right, Rachelle. They've gotten approval in some regions of the world, notably Brazil, but they're facing pushback in the EU, UK, and the US. And their response to the US, the Federal Trade Commission filing a lawsuit to try to block the acquisition, is out. And essentially what they're doing is laying out the same kind of case that we saw them lay out in an editorial earlier this month.Basically, what Microsoft is saying is, look, we're trying to acquire Activision Blizzard. We are the third largest of the three main console manufacturers. Even if we acquire Activision Blizzard for this $69 billion, we're still going to be the third largest video game producer by revenue. So that would be behind Tencent, which is number one, and Sony, which is number two. The big to-do with this whole acquisition is two parts.One is Call of Duty. Activision Blizzard sells ""Call of Duty."" They're the ones that publish it. And it's a cash cow. It made a billion dollars in 10 days for the most recent version that was on the market. They have a mobile version. They have a free to play version where you would buy skins, and that brings in money for them. So it really is a huge generator for Activision Blizzard. They have other titles, yes-- ""Diablo,"" ""World of Warcraft."" But it really is the discussion around Activision Blizzard.The second aspect of that is cloud gaming and cloud gaming services. Now Microsoft has the leader in that with its Game Pass. Its cloud gaming is fantastic on that. I use it regularly. Sony also has cloud gaming. Very good, but the catalog isn't nearly as robust as what Microsoft is offering. Microsoft would use Activision's ""Call of Duty"" to bolster that side of things to bolster its Game Pass and its cloud gaming, make it look far more appealing than it already is, which is, frankly, kind of difficult to do.Story continuesAnd so they see that as the future of gaming. They're looking 15 years down the line. Cloud gaming is going to be where it's at. So many people in the world game on their mobile phones or low powered devices. Not everyone can go out and buy a $500 console. There's a huge market that's untapped from that perspective. And that's what Microsoft is really looking to target here.Sony, on the other hand, is trying to say, look, Microsoft will get too much power. This is a huge game. If people end up only buying Xbox because of this game, it will damage the Sony brand. Now Microsoft has said that they offered Sony 10 years of ""Call of Duty"" guaranteed to be released the same day and date as on the Xbox.Sony has not responded to that or hasn't agreed to that. Microsoft said it's willing to make that legally binding. They've already entered an agreement with Nintendo for that, which doesn't make sense because Nintendo doesn't run ""Call of Duty."" But this is going to be an ongoing battle. There's discussions on both sides, whether it's good or bad for gamers.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, it's been a while since Microsoft's gotten this kind of attention from regulators. Certainly going to be interesting to see how they navigate that. Thanks so much for that, Dan.]"

54,9a5c2c93-b53e-35d7-89dd-031bb14a242f,SIG,2022-12-24,5 Discounted PEG Stocks Ideal for GARP Investors,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-discounted-peg-stocks-ideal-124412148.html,1671799452,STORY,"['SUZ', 'CNM', 'SIG', 'TME', 'BDORY']","[In the equity market, investments need to be prudently hedged to overcome uncertainties and limit losses related to external shocks. A question that arises often is whether one should resort to a value strategy that seeks discounted stocks or opt for growth investing in times of extreme market instability.The investing track of the Oracle of Omaha over the past few decades and his gradual shift from being a pure-play value investor to a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investor might give us all the answers.Per the GARP theory, the strategic mingling of growth and value-investing principles gives us a hybrid strategy, offering an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both. What GARPers look for is whether or not the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).Several stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, show an overwhelming success of this hybrid investing strategy over pure-play value and growth investments. Here we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These include Signet Jewelers SIG, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Tencent Music Entertainment Group TME, Banco do Brasil S.A. BDORY and Core &amp; Main, Inc. CNM.A Few More Words on GARPGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks’ P/E ratio with the future earnings growth rates.While P/E alone gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps identify stocks with solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio indicating both undervaluation and future growth potential.Story continuesUnfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold), offer the best upside potential.Here are the five stocks that qualified the screening:Signet Jewelers: Headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda, Signet Jewelers is a retailer of diamond jewelry, watches as well as other products. The company operates in the United States, Canada, the U.K., the Republic of Ireland, and the Channel Islands. The company is often considered the leading retailer of diamond jewelry.Signet Jewelers can also be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of B.

We particularly want to thank Representatives Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) and Gus Bilirakis (R-FL), and Senators Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), for serving as staunch champions for this important legislation.""The INFORM Consumers Act is a bipartisan piece of federal legislation that is critical in helping law enforcement, manufacturers, retailers, and online marketplaces of all sizes work together to protect consumers from bad actors peddling counterfeit and stolen goods. The INFORM Consumers Act increases transparency and accountability by implementing sensible verification and disclosure requirements designed to disrupt the ability to sell illicit goods through online marketplaces. These criminal transactions compete directly with legitimate businesses, retailers, and emerging entrepreneurs. Specifically, online marketplaces will need to verify the identities of high-volume third-party sellers and disclose basic information to shoppers and law enforcement.In October 2021 when the legislation was first introduced, Walgreens joined dozens of other associations, businesses, manufacturers, and marketplaces supporting the legislation. Once enacted, INFORM is slated to empower every state attorney general to enforce the law’s provisions.Story continuesWalgreens is proud to work with states that have already established statewide Organized Retail Crime (ORC) task forces to coordinate efforts between attorneys general, local law enforcement and retail asset protection professionals to build cases and prosecute criminals. Walgreens is encouraging every state to make tackling ORC a priority by funding dedicated task forces to prosecute criminal rings operating in their communities.About WalgreensWalgreens (www.walgreens.com) is included in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and U.S. Healthcare segments of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.13bUS$2.51bUS$2.80bUS$3.00bUS$3.13bUS$3.22bUS$3.31bUS$3.40bUS$3.48bUS$3.56bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.13%Est @ 2.78%Est @ 2.54%Est @ 2.37%Est @ 2.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$81bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$81b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$44bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$65b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$77.2, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sysco as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SyscoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

63,6aeb5952-1246-3523-b081-712368abbddf,ADM,2022-12-24,20 Countries that Produce the Most Wheat,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-produce-most-wheat-134054434.html,1671802854,STORY,['ADM'],"[In this article, we will discuss the 20 Countries that Produce the Most Wheat. You can skip our detailed analysis of the wheat market and go directly to the 5 Countries that Produce the Most Wheat.Agriculture is as vital for the global economy as it is for the survival of our species. Agriculture ensures the supply of food, helps reduce poverty by triggering economic and industrial growth, and reduces income disparities. Food security is among any government's top priorities, especially in times of economic crisis or turmoil. The trade disruptions after the outbreak of COVID-19 caused a rise in the prices of many agricultural commodities and underscored the importance of being self-sufficient in agriculture for many countries.Wheat is an important cereal crop. The total wheat cultivated area has exceeded 220 million hectares worldwide. Both developed and developing countries produce wheat, with developed regions being responsible for 50% of the total worldwide wheat production and a total harvested area of 53%. In the developing regions, wheat accounts for more than 35% of the cereal calories consumed, compared to 74% in the developed regions. Around 70% of the wheat produced globally is used for food, while 20% is used for livestock, and 2-3% is utilized in the industrial sector.The wheat industry was also affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. Initially, panic buying was witnessed around the world due to some concerns, including supply chain issues and expectations of industries not being able to operate steadily during the pandemic. However, the agriculture sector was permitted to operate by governments around the world even during wide lockdowns, given its importance for the survival of people around the world.As the world population continues to grow, wheat demand is also increasing and is estimated to keep rising in the coming years. In 2021, the wheat market size was valued at $127.7 billion and is forecasted to reach $169.1 billion by 2027. Although factors like increasing awareness of gluten allergies and sensitivities and uncertain weather conditions in several parts of the world can harm growth during the forecast period, the increased consumption of wheat in cuisines across countries and increased demand by the processing industries for products like flour, pasta, noodles, and beverages are expected to drive the market in the coming years.Story continuesAsia Pacific regions, which include China, India, Pakistan, and Australia, are among the world's largest wheat producers. China and India are also the world's largest wheat producers and consumers. The increase in demand and consumption of wheat is due to wheat being a major staple food of this region. Some of the top companies involved in the production and marketing of wheat include Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), and Seaboard Corporation (NYSE:SEB).countries that produce the most wheatPhoto by Darla Hueske on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo come up with the list of countries that produce the most wheat, we sourced data from indexmundi for estimated figures for the annual production of wheat in 2022 by each country.

65,c454d0f2-68ab-3be8-9b39-e964d4c1cbce,SNPS,2022-12-24,Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Synopsys (SNPS) Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-growth-investors-buy-synopsys-174505457.html,1671817505,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Synopsys (SNPS) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of software used to test and develop chips a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Synopsys is 32.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 13.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 3.1%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Synopsys is 25.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 15.4%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 31.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 13.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Synopsys. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.5% over the past month.Bottom LineSynopsys has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Synopsys is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CHEF, Synopsys, Inc. SNPS, Enphase Energy, Inc. ENPH, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and Fabrinet FN.Buy 5 Stocks with Upgraded Broker Ratings for the New YearWith the turbulent 2022 coming to an end, it's time for investors to re-assess their portfolio and investment strategy for the New Year. While recent economic data point to the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high til inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors wary, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. At this stage, one way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc., Synopsys, Inc., Enphase Energy, Inc., ONEOK, Inc. and Fabrinet are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They meticulously assess companies' publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.Hence, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Here are five of the seven stocks that qualified for the screening:Ridgefield, CT-based Chefs' Warehouse is engaged in the distribution of specialty food products. CHEF's product portfolio includes nearly 50,000 stock-keeping units, such as specialty food products, such as artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars, truffles, caviar, chocolate and pastry products.Story continuesChefs' Warehouse's 2023 earnings are projected to grow 9.7%.

It is on track with price increases to wean the ongoing cost pressures. This led to sales growth of 15.2% and 20.2% on a reported and currency-adjusted basis in third-quarter 2022.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gained 15.7% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.2%.Let’s delve deeperFactors Narrating MNST’s Growth StoryMonster Beverage has been witnessing continued strength in its energy drinks category for a long time. In third-quarter 2022, the Monster Energy Drinks segment's net sales advanced 13% year over year to $1.5 billion. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the segment rose 18%. Sales for the company's energy brands, including Reign, rose 2.9% in the 13-week period ended Oct 22, 2022. Sales for the Monster brand improved 11.2% year over year in the quarter. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Management is optimistic about strength in the global energy drinks category. It is poised to gain from growth in the Monster Energy family of brands, and strength in Strategic and Affordable energy brands.The company remains committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. In third-quarter 2022, the company launched many products and expanded distribution in international markets. In the quarter, it launched Predator in Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Jordan, along with the continued rollout of Predator in India.Consequently, MNST intends to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the last quarter of 2022 and the first half of 2023.The company launched Monster Super Cola in a can in Japan in August and Monster Rehab Tea Plus Lemonade in October. In EMEA, it launched Monster Assault and Monster Reserve White Pineapple in certain countries. Also, MNST introduced Juiced Monarch, Juiced Chaotic, Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon in a few countries.The company launched additional SKUs of Burn, Predator and Rain in certain countries in the said quarter. In July, it introduced its first 16-ounce 12-pack ultra-variety packs in Puerto Rico. In August, the company launched Monster Reserve Watermelon and Reserve White Pineapple.Monster Dragon Tea Lemon was launched in Honduras and El Salvador in August, while the same was launched in Guatemala in September. Monster Juice Monarch was launched in August. Its juice portfolio witnessed an expansion in Mexico in August. In Australia, the company expanded its Mother portfolio and launched Mother Lava Guava.The company is on track to launch Monster Energy Zero Sugar in fourth-quarter 2022, initially in the United States. Monster Energy Zero Sugar is developed to provide a zero-sugar variant of its original Monster Energy Green flavor.MNST revealed plans to launch pure unflavored water namely, Monster Tour Water, in the United States, in still and sparkling variants, in the first half of 2023. The company intends to launch Rainstorm in 4 flavors in the first half of 2023. Also, Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar Energy Drink is likely to enter select EMEA markets in the fourth quarter of 2022, with a rollout to 20 additional markets in the first quarter of 2023.The company remained optimistic about the launch of its first flavored malt beverage alcohol product, known as ‘The Beast Unleashed.’ Gains from the CANarchy acquisition, and a robust line-up of product launches for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks make it well-placed for long-term growth.MNST has been making efforts to overcome supply-chain challenges. Some of the notable actions taken to navigate through the challenges are decreasing its reliance on imported cans. The company is purchasing aluminum cans from local sources in the United States and EMEA. MNST also rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long-distance freight to meet consumer demand. It is returning to its orbit strategy of producing closer to customers.Meanwhile, Monster Beverage is implementing pricing actions to overcome the ongoing cost pressures. In third-quarter 2022, the company was on track with the mitigation of higher production and distribution costs through pricing actions and lowered promotional expenses. It implemented price increases for its products in the United States on Sep 1, 2022. It also brought effective price increases in certain international markets in the third quarter.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeHowever, the company continues to grapple with inflationary operational costs for aluminum cans, shipping, freight and other inputs. This, along with elevated ingredients and other input costs, comprising secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, hurt the margins. The company’s third-quarter 2022 gross margin contracted 460 basis points (bps) to 51.3%.Operating expenses grew 20.6% year over year to $415.8 million due to higher warehousing and other logistical expenses, elevated payroll expenses, increased selling and marketing expenses, and increased general and administrative expenses. Also, operating income of $417.9 million declined 6% year over year, driven by a decrease in the gross margin, as well as higher operating expenses. The operating margin contracted 580 bps to 25.7% in the reported quarter. Consequently, third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of 60 cents per share declined 3.9% year over year.ConclusionMonster Beverages appears to be in good shape despite the industry challenges, driven by the introduction of innovative products across the Monster family to suit consumers’ needs as well as strength in its energy drinks category. Topping it, a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.4% raises optimism about the stock. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has moved up 0.9% in the past 60 days.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, e.l.f.

However, escalated fuel costs, a primary headwind, are limiting its bottom-line growth.Factors Favoring LUVThe gradual improvement in air-travel demand is a huge boon for Southwest Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Management expects fourth-quarter 2022 operating revenues to register 13-17% growth compared with 2019 levels.Southwest Airlines’ fleet-modernization efforts are commendable as well. LUV expects to end the next year with 841 planes in its fleet.Following the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act, which prohibited airlines from paying dividends till Sep 30, management reinstated its quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share. With the carrier returning to profitability in March 2022 and expecting to be profitable for full-year 2022 as well, the decision was hugely-expected. The dividend will be paid out on Jan 31, 2023 to its shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan 10, 2023.Southwest Airlines' liquidity position raises optimism in the stock. At the end of the third quarter, the carrier’s cash and cash equivalents were $10,443 million, higher than the long-term debt (less current maturities) of $8,315 million, implying that the company has enough cash to meet its debt obligations.Key RisksEscalating fuel costs pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. Oil price is moving north, primarily because of supply concerns stemming from Russia-Ukraine war.In third-quarter 2022, fuel price per gallon escalated 68.7% to $3.39. Fuel cost per gallon in fourth-quarter 2022 is expected in the $3.10-$3.20 band. The midpoint of the guided range is much higher than the fourth-quarter 2021 actuals of $2.25.Southwest Airlines expects fourth-quarter 2022 capacity to decline 2% from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. For 2022, capacity is expected to decline 7.5-9.5% from the 2019 levels. Due to low capacity, CASM (cost per available seat miles), excluding fuel and special items, is high and is expected to increase 14-18% in fourth-quarter 2022 from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals.Story continuesWith airlines having trimmed their labor force substantially during the peak of the pandemic, the airline industry is grappling with a staffing crunch as demand bounces back and LUV is no exception.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may, however, consider the following better-ranked stocks:Covenant Logistics CVLG: CVLG offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, including asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, beside asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability.The gradually improving freight market scenario is a tailwind for Covenant. CVLG’s cost-control efforts are appreciated as well. CVLG currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised 10.1% upward in the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Teekay Tankers TNK: TNK is well-served by the increase in tanker rates. A gradual ramp-up in economic activities also bodes well. High fuel costs are, however, weighing on the bottom line.Teekay Tankers currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. TNK’s shares have soared 160% in a year.

Aptiv and the seller agreed to the amended purchase price, in part, as a result of certain changes in Wind River's current operating structure required to bring the regulatory approval process to a satisfactory conclusion. These changes will not impact the strategic direction of Wind River nor our expectations for its value creation, but will require certain one-time costs and recurring operating expenses. The transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in 2023. The company will provide further details regarding the transaction on the fourth quarter earnings call on February 2, 2023.About AptivAptiv PLC is a global technology company that develops safer, greener and more connected solutions enabling a more sustainable future of mobility.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. KNSL and American International Group, Inc. AIG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Insurance Stocks That Have Outperformed the S&amp;P 500 YTDEconomic uncertainty worsened in the first half of 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, sluggish economic growth, rising interest rates, and soaring inflation. Improved pricing, increased technology advancements, exposure growth and global expansion as well as an impressive solvency level have been tailwinds for the insurance industry. Prudent underwriting standards, lower mortality rates and an improving rate environment have also added to the upside.The insurance industry has declined 0.4% year to date compared with the Finance sector's decrease of 16.5% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's decline of 21.1%.Here are four insurance stocks that have managed to perform well so far this year backed by their strong fundamentals.  Arch Capital Group Ltd., The Travelers Companies, Inc., Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. and American International Group, Inc. have outperformed the industry, the sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite year to date. These stocks are poised to retain the rally, given solid prospects.Factors at PlayPer Global Insurance Market Index released by Marsh, global commercial insurance prices increased 6% in the third quarter of 2022. It marked the 20th consecutive quarter of price increases. Per the Swiss Re Institute, the insurance industry is expected to generate premium growth of 2.1% on average over the next two years. A declining level of inflation, solid life insurance demand and market hardening in property and casualty lines should continue to support the growth.Story continuesAn expanded distribution, operational strength, higher retention, strong renewal, price increases, the appointment of retail agents, and a solid balance sheet have boosted insurers' momentum. The insurance industry players are well poised for growth on the back of higher new business premiums, growth in the line of business, increase in agency renewal written premiums, improving return on equity and non-cat property losses, and expanding international business.Diversified portfolio, which, in turn, lowers concentration risk, is also a positive. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, benefited sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, global life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023.The property and casualty insurance industry remains exposed to severe weather events that make underwriting results and in turn earnings volatile. Per Swiss Re Institute, natural catastrophe activity has resulted in insured losses of $115 billion in so far 2022, which is higher than the 10-year average of $81 billion. Swiss Re estimated Hurricane Ian as the most expensive one with estimated preliminary insured losses of $50 billion to $65 billion. Nevertheless, prudent underwriting, continued increases in pricing, reinsurance programs and favorable reserve development have helped to maintain underwriting profitability.A near-zero interest rate environment concerns insurers as it weighs on investment income, one of the important components of insurers' top line. A larger invested base, directing funds to alternative investments like private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, is expected to drive the metric in the future. Seven rate hikes have been implemented by the Fed so far in 2022. In the last monetary policy meeting of 2022, the Fed raised interest rates by 50 bps to the range of 4.25 to 4.5%.A solid capital position enables insurers to pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions, invest in growth initiatives, engage in share buybacks, and increase dividends or pay out special dividends. Mergers and alliances boost portfolios, diversify operations into new business lines and geography and have enabled them to enter more profitable market segments. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, the insurance industry witnessed 427 completed deals in the first half of 2022, which increased 16% year over year.The insurance industry players continue to invest in technology like robotic process automation, Chatbot and RoboAdvisory, artificial intelligence and data analytics, insurtech solutions, telematics, cloud computing. These investments have expedited business operations, enhanced internal efficiency and bolstered data and analytics capabilities and saveed costs which in turn will benefit margins.Solid Picks for Better ReturnsWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected four insurance stocks that rallied year to date and are poised to retain the momentum next year.Pembroke, Bermuda, Arch Capital Group is a leading specialty P&amp;C and mortgage insurer and offers insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance worldwide.

78,53097a99-1e69-340c-a68d-ae3959efcff4,HOLX,2022-12-24,"Investors Heavily Search Hologic, Inc. (HOLX): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-hologic-inc-140002468.html,1671804002,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned +1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has gained 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share, indicating a change of -59.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.46 points to a change of -42.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 indicates a change of +12.5% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $962.24 million indicates a year-over-year change of -34.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.81 billion and $4.04 billion estimates indicate -21.6% and +5.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $953.3 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.6%. EPS of $0.82 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $866.83 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.98%. The EPS surprise was +32.26%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reed Hastings, co-CEO and chairman, is set to receive the same compensation package next year as he did in 2022, with a salary of $650,000 and stock options worth approximately $34 million.With the 2023 compensation packages, Netflix is reintroducing bonuses for its top execs, after having suspended them for the last several years, as well as new salary caps for Hastings, Sarandos and COO and chief product officer Greg Peters. Netflix disclosed the pay packages set by its board’s compensation committee in an SEC filing Friday.For Sarandos, his base salary will go from $20 million this year to $3 million in 2023; at the same time, he will become eligible for a new $17 million performance bonus next year. He again is set to receive $20 million worth of stock options.Peters could receive up to $24 million ($1.5 million in salary, $12 million in stock options, and $10.5 million in estimated target bonus). That would be the same as 2022, except that stock and the bonus represent a larger portion of his pay package.According to the SEC filing, the Netflix board’s compensation committee adopted the following compensation program changes for 2023 for Hastings, Sarandos and Peters: (1) a minimum 50% allocation of the officer’s allocatable compensation to stock options; (2) a salary cap of $3 million in the case of the co-CEOs and $1.5 million in the case of the COO; and (3) an annual performance-based cash bonus program.For 2023, Sarandos and Peters will participate in the bonus program. Hastings will not “because his cash compensation is less than the $3 million salary cap,” according to the Netflix filing.Netflix had adopted performance bonuses in 2015 and then dropped them with the 2018 calendar year (instead delivering all cash compensation as salary) because Trump’s 2017 federal tax-reform law eliminated a tax write-off for bonuses.Story continuesIn its 2022 proxy statement, the board said, “We do not use performance-based bonuses as we believe that they tend to incentivize specific, typically short-term focused behavior rather than encourage long-term stockholder value creation.” Netflix’s stock price is down about 50% year to date, which was likely a factor for the decision to reinstate the bonus program.“Awards under the Plan will only be paid after achievement of specified performance goals,” Netflix said in Friday’s 8-K filing. “The Committee will be the administrator of the Plan and will assign each participant a target award and performance goal or goals for a performance period set by the Committee.” It added that the estimated target bonus amounts for Sarandos and Peters “are estimates only, and any actual amounts that may be paid to the may differ based on factors adopted by the Committee pursuant to the Plan.”The company detailed compensation packages for other named executive officers Friday. In 2023, CFO Spencer Neumann will receive $14 million ($7 million in salary and $7 million in stock options), chief legal officer David Hyman will get $11 million ($4 million salary, $7 million in stock) and chief communications officer Rachel Whetstone is to receive $6.5 million ($5.7 million salary, $800,000 in stock).Best of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in January 2023What's Coming to Disney+ in January 2023Oscar Predictions: Live Action Short - Alfonso Cuarón and Disney are Early Favorites Among Multiple Non-English and International Titles]"

That will encourage password-sharers to create sub-accounts (“Extra Members”) and pay for people outside their households. Recent headlines about the initiative — “The End of Netflix Password Sharing Is Nigh” (Wall Street Journal) and “The End of Free Netflix Password Sharing Is Coming” (CNET) — have made it seem like the company will starting enforcing the no-account-sharing rule with punitive measures. In fact, Netflix’s password-sharing-monetization plan is essentially based on the honor system.Netflix hasn’t disclosed what an Extra Member sub-account would cost in the U.S. or other new markets. In Chile, Costa Rica and Peru, that fee has been 23%-29% of the Netflix Standard two-stream plan, which suggests that in the U.S. the cost of sub-accounts could be $3.50-$4.50 each. In the three test markets, Netflix has notified members who appear to be sharing their account outside their household (detected based on data such as IP addresses, device IDs and account activity from devices signed into the Netflix account) about the new payment options. Netflix also has prompted users to verify their credentials by sending a verification code to the primary account-holder.And if customer don’t pay up for password piggybackers? All signs indicate that the most aggressive Netflix intends to get in the first iteration of the paid-sharing rollout is to keep prodding violators with email reminders and notifications.Story continuesThe company’s help page on password sharing currently says, “Netflix will not automatically charge you if you share your account with someone who doesn’t live with you.” That’s unlikely to change in the near future. If Netflix were to automatically levy new fees for account sharing, besides angering customers — who have engaged in password-sharing for years with Netflix’s wink-and-a-nod approval — it would attract scrutiny from regulators over potential anti-consumer billing practices.The fact that Netflix’s monetization strategy for password-sharing is on an opt-in basis highlights uncertainty about how much incremental money it will reap from the so-called “crackdown.” The company is eager to develop new revenue streams as core subscriber growth has slowed (and actually shrank in the first half of 2022). In addition to paid-sharing monetization, Netflix this year hustled to launch a new, cheaper ad-supported plan in November; that appears to be off to a relatively slow start.Netflix has estimated that passwords are being shared in violation of its rules with more than 100 million non-paying households worldwide — but obviously, it won’t be able to convert all of that activity into revenue. Wall Street firm Cowen has estimated that Netflix’s paid-sharing program could add nearly 15 million paid sharers and 1 million new members in the U.S. and Canada in 2023, representing some $721 million in incremental revenue in the UCAN region annually (5.1% over previous analyst estimates). That’s based on a Cowen consumer survey, conducted in August 2022, asking password-sharers if they would pay an extra $3/month; 50% of respondents said either they or the primary account holder would do so. Needless to say, however, there’s a difference between what people say they will do and what they actually do.Meanwhile, Netflix has rolled out additional features designed to encourage password-moochers to do the right thing and pay for legit account access. This fall, it added the ability for subscribers convert user profiles into separate new accounts and a dashboard to let users log out individual devices remotely.“We would never roll out something that feels like ‘turning the screws'” on people who share passwords, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s co-CEO and co-founder, said on the company’s Q1 2021 earnings interview. “It’s gotta feel like it makes sense to consumers, that they understand.” Of course, Hastings once insisted that Netflix would not launch an ad-supported plan, so — never say never.VIP+ Survey: U.S. Netflix Users Favor Password Sharing  Best of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in January 2023What's Coming to Disney+ in January 2023Oscar Predictions: Live Action Short - Alfonso Cuarón and Disney are Early Favorites Among Multiple Non-English and International Titles]"

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now with the breakdown.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thanks, Sozz. It's been a wild ride for media companies this year. Netflix down 50%. Disney and Paramount Global, same story there, down roughly 45%. But that's nothing compared to Roku, which has dropped 80% on the year with Warner Brothers, Discovery, and Spotify sinking more than 60%.And this year alone, the stock market wiped a whopping $500 billion-plus off of the market caps of major media giants with more pain expected in 2023. So how did we get here and what could happen next.? Let's start at the very beginning.2022, post-COVID, post stay-at-home train, and we saw subscriber growth levels slow. Netflix lost users two quarters in a row during the first half of the year, while NBC's Peacock saw zero growth at all in the second quarter. So amid that slowdown, coupled with those declines seen in linear television and a shaky macro environment, investors shifted focus to profitability. Are you a business that can make money?As a result, we saw massive amounts of layoffs, hiring freezes, massive restructuring efforts. And remember, these companies were spending tens of billions of dollars a year on just content alone. So it was a huge transition.But despite it all, there were some bright spots in 2022. Number one being ad supported. Netflix and Disney rolled out their respective ad tiers towards the end of this year. A lot of optimism on the Street when it comes to how advertising can help add incremental revenue and help hedge against churn, especially as competition intensifies.So that's something to look out for in 2023. Another highlight was that studios regained confidence in the box office. We had some record-breaking movies this year. ""Top Gun Maverick"" smashing a 15-year-old record. By far, the top movie of the year.Story continuesAnd then those Marvel films like ""Wakanda Forever,"" ""Doctor Strange,"" also killed it. Easily nabbing 100 million-plus openers. And even though ""Avatar 2"" did miss expectations, industry executives still say the film will outperform and continue to add box office dollars throughout the holiday season and into 2023. So theatrical, not fully back to those prepandemic levels but not as pessimistic as things seemed to be in 2021.And then finally another thing to watch will be more media mergers and acquisitions. As profitability is pressured, M&amp;A is often the go-to solution. There's lots of talk on the street that Paramount could be unloaded. Disney, what will Bob Iger do with ESPN and Hulu? And what about WBT? Could that be a potential acquisition target down the line?So there will be assets for sale. It's a direct result of this soul-searching moment for the industry. In 2023, it's going to be a year of tough decisions. And I think it's safe to say, not every media company is going to survive that.JULIE HYMAN: Well, I guess we'll see what that means for this coming year. That was Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal breaking down the year in media. We'll be watching to see what 2023, of course, holds for the industry.]"

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: DCP Midstream, LP DCP, Conagra Brands CAG, Entergy Corp. ETR, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and Phillips 66 PSX.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Growth Stocks That Pay Solid DividendsSoaring inflation rate and interest rate hikes topped the list of adversities that ruled the U.S. economy in 2022, resulting in volatile stock market performance. The Federal Reserve recently raised the interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.25%-4.5% to curb inflation. The tightened monetary policy, looming fears of recession, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising commodity prices and supply-chain headwinds have compelled investors to look for safe and profitable investment options with growth potential.Why Growth Stocks?Growth stocks are a lucrative way to channelize the investments, as these stocks with above-average financial growth can easily capture the market's attention and generate higher returns. Investing in such stocks can fetch solid returns over the long and short run. Growth stocks include companies having the potential to exceed the overall market growth over time with higher profits and revenues.With the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it much easier to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Why Invest in Dividend-Paying Stocks?Investors generally look for safe and profitable stocks apart from focusing on growth investments. This is easily catered by stocks that pay regular quarterly dividends as these have a stable profit stream with a strong balance sheet. Investing in dividend stocks is also appealing for investors seeking a regular income stream or making wealth by reinvesting dividend payments into capital accumulation. Traditionally, dividend stocks are low-risk investments and are safe to hold.Story continuesApart from boosting profits and lowering portfolio risks for investors, dividend stocks offer fundamental analysis and tax advantages.

Further, the leading upstream energy firm, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is likely to record earnings growth of 134.4% in 2022.Factors Working in FavorWest Texas Intermediate crude price, trading at more than $75 per barrel, is extremely favorable for upstream activities. Being a leading exploration and production company globally, ConocoPhillips is well-positioned to capitalize on handsome crude prices. ConocoPhillips has a strong footprint in prolific oil-rich plays like the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford and Bakken, brightening up the company’s production outlook. For 2022, the company expects production at 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoE/D), suggesting an improvement from 1.6 MMBoE/D for 2021COP is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. Apart from increasing quarterly ordinary dividend by 11%, ConocoPhillips also lifted its share buyback authorization by $20 billion.RisksBeing an upstream energy player, the overall operations of the company are strongly exposed to volatility in oil and natural gas prices. Moreover, significantly increasing expenses related to purchased commodities are hurting its bottom line.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked players in the energy space are Phillips 66 PSX, Precision Drilling Corporation PDS and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc.

89,44ddcc7e-8570-3117-8f39-6b439ed3b0bd,PSX,2022-12-24,Phillips 66 (PSX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-psx-trending-stock-140002095.html,1671804002,STORY,['PSX'],"[Phillips 66 (PSX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -9.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.3% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Phillips 66 belongs, has lost 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $4.45 per share, indicating a change of +51.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $19.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +242.6%. This estimate has changed -4.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.86 indicates a change of -29% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Phillips 66 is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $170.55 billion and $145.04 billion estimates indicate +48.5% and -15% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $48.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +54.9%. EPS of $6.46 for the same period compares with $3.18 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.49%. The EPS surprise was +29.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AMGN) Suggests It's 37% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-amgen-inc-nasdaq-120038508.html,1671883238,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Does the December share price for Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.4bUS$11.3bUS$11.8bUS$12.2bUS$12.6bUS$12.9bUS$13.3bUS$13.6bUS$13.9bUS$14.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67%Est @ 2.46%Est @ 2.32%Est @ 2.22%Est @ 2.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$9.7kUS$9.8kUS$9.6kUS$9.3kUS$8.9kUS$8.5kUS$8.2kUS$7.8kUS$7.4kUS$7.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$86bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$278bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$278b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$139bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$225b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$264, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amgen as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.935. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AmgenStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Biotechs industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Biotechs market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines is:4.6% = US$4.4m ÷ US$97m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every CA$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated CA$0.05 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' Earnings Growth And 4.6% ROEOn the face of it, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 12%. For this reason, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' five year net income decline of 26% is not surprising given its lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 32% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

This made up 86% of the country's $2.673 billion target for 2022, Ordonez added.The figures include sales from the Mirador copper mine, owned by EcuaCorriente, a subsidiary of the Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan Investment, and gold exports from Canada's Lundin Gold's Fruta del Norte, as well as small-scale mining.The government expects four major mining projects will begin operations by the end of President Guillermo Lasso's term in 2025, including the Cascabel project, held by Australia's SolGold.

You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that NextEra Energy insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$279m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded NextEra Energy shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, NextEra Energy insiders feel good about the company's future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

103,e77fe73b-80ae-3a4b-ace4-c187198272c8,MA,2022-12-24,Avino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd.'s (TSE:ASM) Financials Are Too Obscure To Link With Current Share Price Momentum: What's In Store For the Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avino-silver-gold-mines-ltd-124418748.html,1671885858,STORY,"['ASM', 'GC=F', 'SI=F']","[Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' (TSE:ASM) stock is up by a considerable 42% over the past three months. However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines is:4.6% = US$4.4m ÷ US$97m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every CA$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated CA$0.05 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' Earnings Growth And 4.6% ROEOn the face of it, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 12%. For this reason, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' five year net income decline of 26% is not surprising given its lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 32% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

This made up 86% of the country's $2.673 billion target for 2022, Ordonez added.The figures include sales from the Mirador copper mine, owned by EcuaCorriente, a subsidiary of the Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan Investment, and gold exports from Canada's Lundin Gold's Fruta del Norte, as well as small-scale mining.The government expects four major mining projects will begin operations by the end of President Guillermo Lasso's term in 2025, including the Cascabel project, held by Australia's SolGold.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has awarded the deal.Details of the DealValued at $117.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will execute inspections, modifications and repairs on the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G jets.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.6% from the 2021 reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.62%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions.

GILD announced that the FDA has approved lenacapavir in combination with other antiretroviral(s) (ARV) under the brand name Sunlenca for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) adults with multi-drug-resistant (MDR) HIV-1 infection.The approval of this new, twice-yearly treatment option for adults with HIV that is not adequately controlled by their current treatment regimen will boost Gilead’s strong HIV franchise.Sunlenca, a first-in-class, long-acting HIV capsid inhibitor, has a multi-stage mechanism of action distinguishable from other currently approved classes of antiviral agents. Most antivirals act on just one stage of viral replication, while Sunlenca is designed to inhibit HIV at multiple stages of its lifecycle and has no known cross-resistance to other existing drug classes. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and ConsensusGilead Sciences, Inc. Price and ConsensusGilead Sciences, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteSunlenca tablets are approved for oral loading during the initiation of treatment, prior to or at the time of the first long-acting lenacapavir injection, depending on the initiation option.Sunlenca is the only HIV treatment option administered twice yearly and thus will have an advantage over other existing treatments due to its less frequent dosing requirements.The FDA approval for Sunlenca is supported by data from the phase II/III CAPELLA study, which evaluated lenacapavir in combination with an optimized background regimen in people with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 who are HTE.  These patients had undergone previous treatment with a median of nine antiretroviral medications. 83% (n=30/36) of participants randomly allocated to receive lenacapavir in addition to an optimized background regimen achieved an undetectable viral load at week 52.We remind investors that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in HTE patients with multi-drug resistance in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.Story continuesIn May 2022, the FDA lifted the clinical hold placed on Gilead’s Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to evaluate injectable lenacapavir for HIV treatment and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).The hold was placed on the use of injectable lenacapavir in borosilicate vials due to a vial compatibility issue. The FDA removed the clinical hold following the agency’s review of Gilead’s comprehensive plan and corresponding data on the storage and compatibility of lenacapavir injection with an alternative vial made from aluminosilicate glass.We note that Sunlenca has already received approval from the European Union in August 2022. Additional regulatory filings and decisions by regulatory authorities are anticipated to continue in 2023.Gilead’s HIV portfolio continues to maintain momentum for the company, driven by growth in demand for flagship HIV therapy Biktarvy. Descovy (FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg) sales have also boosted the top line. However, the loss of exclusivity for Truvada has hurt the company’s business.Gilead has had a good run in 2022, as its shares have gained 17.5% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 19.2%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, competition is stiff in the HIV space from the likes of GSK plc GSK and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and hence the approval of new treatments holds the key.In February 2022, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced that the FDA has approved an expanded label for Cabenuva (rilpivirine and cabotegravir) to be administered every two months for the treatment of HIV-1 in virologically suppressed adults.It was earlier approved in January 2021 as a once-monthly, complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed. The regimen was co-developed as part of a collaboration with ViiV Healthcare.ViiV Healthcare was formed in 2009 by GSK and Pfizer.

Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”9. Walmart Inc.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance.

It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time.

Reported EPS is $1.3, expectations were $1.28.Ryan Weispfenning: Good morning. I am Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations and welcome to snowing Minneapolis. I appreciate that you are joining us today for Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I will share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 28, 2022 as well as our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs for each of our four segments will join us and we will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company.Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our Q1 acquisition of Intersect ENT. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the first quarter of fiscal 23 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter of 2022 compared to the third calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.Story continuesWith that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter.Photo by Marcel Scholte on UnsplashGeoff Martha: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our Q2 results and outlook. Our Q2 organic constant currency revenue growth of 2.2% came in about 1 point below expectations due to a slower-than-expected recovery in both procedure volumes in certain markets and in our supply chain. In terms of reported revenue, the continued strength of the dollar over the course of the quarter drove over half the difference to expectations. Now despite the top line results, we were able to control expenses and deliver EPS at the high-end of our guidance range. We also issued guidance for the back half of our fiscal year this morning. We expect continued acceleration in organic revenue growth in the second half, although less than previously anticipated and this partially flows through to EPS.Now, this is something that I don't take lightly, delivering on our expectations is important to building and maintaining trust and credibility with you. Karen will walk you through the details, but some of our markets and some of our supply constraints recovered more slowly than we expected in the quarter, and that, along with incremental China volume-based procurements, led us to reduce our expectations. While the current operating environment remains challenging, we had strong growth in several businesses and geographies, where our strategy, our operating model and execution are yielding solid results. We have near-term product catalysts in our pipeline. We are decisively allocating capital internally and selectively making focused acquisitions.We are making improvements to the operational health of the company and we are streamlining the company's structure and taking cost out. All of this gives us confidence that we are on the path to creating durable growth and shareholder value. Now, diving deeper into our Q2 results, for reported revenue, as I said earlier, currency drove over half the miss to consensus. Organically, the miss was primarily split evenly between two challenges. One, procedure volumes in some markets have been slower to return to normal levels and two, some of our supply challenges have persisted longer than we anticipated. With regard to procedural volumes, in addition to an incremental China VBP, we are still seeing lower volumes in elective coronary PCI, GI procedures, TAVR, spinal cord stim and some less emergent surgical procedures.The slower-than-anticipated recovery in procedural volumes primarily occurred in developed markets as healthcare systems continue to work through staffing and other challenges. Now with regard to supply, we have made meaningful recovery and many of the most acute issues are now behind us, including the acute packaging issues, which we highlighted last quarter. But some of the improvements did come later than we expected in Q2, and as a result, we missed cases in businesses like surgical innovations and it has delayed our expected momentum. Now focusing beyond challenges impacting our markets and product availability, we have a number of businesses where our strategy and execution are yielding results. Recall that we moved to the new operating model 2 years ago, we created highly focused, accountable and empowered operating units that can move with greater speed and decisiveness.And today, we are clearly seeing the benefit of this model across many of our businesses. Starting with cranial and spinal technologies, CST grew 5% and this is despite a large negative impact from China VBP. In fact, our U.S. core spine business grew 15%. Additionally, this quarter, we launched our spine technology ecosystem, which we call Aible at the NASS conference. From planning to our best-in-class implants to navigation and robotic assistance to interoperative imaging and surgical tools up to and including patient follow-up. Aible brings spinal surgery together in one seamless and connected platform. And another highlight was our structural heart business, where our TAVR business grew 15% globally, including 17% in the United States.The launch of our Evolut FX valve drove 18% sequential revenue growth in our U.S. TAVR business, despite being at full market launch for only the last month of the quarter. So, we expect Evolut FX to drive momentum for us over the coming quarters. Our Cardiac Rhythm Management business continues to execute and win share, with 4% growth in this quarter. Within CRM, our pacing business grew 6%, well above the market, with 18% growth of our micro family of leadless pacemakers. And we are looking forward to the commercial introduction of our AURORA EV-ICD in the back half of this fiscal year. So while we have businesses where the changes we have made over the past couple of years are clearly having a positive impact. We are also focused on ensuring these efforts translate into improved performance in all of our businesses.It's worth highlighting a few businesses where we are making strong progress to drive future growth over the near to mid-term and some of that already have immediate momentum. Let's take cardiac ablation solutions, a business that we expect to be a strong future growth driver. Pulsed Field Ablation represents a large market opportunity and we are looking forward to seeing our PULSED AF pivotal trial results in the first half of the next calendar year, putting us on the path to be one of the first companies with the PFA catheter in the U.S. market, which we think is underappreciated. This is a meaningful growth opportunity for Medtronic in the next 18 to 24 months. And as you know, we closed our acquisition of Affera in August and Affera's differentiated mapping and navigation system gives us the breadth and differentiation that we need to win share in cardiac ablation.And we expect to complete enrollment this quarter in the pivotal. This fully integrated system will be the first of its kind to offer a unique catheter that can perform high-density mapping and deliver both pulsed field and radiofrequency ablation in a single device. Now in diabetes, we remain focused on resolving our warning letter. We have now completed a 100% of our warning later commitments and have informed the FDA that we are ready for reinspection. We also remain in active review with the FDA on our submission of the MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 Sensor. And outside the U.S., we continue to receive positive customer feedback on the performance of the 780G, which is now available in over 60 countries. In Q2, 780G drove mid-teens growth for our diabetes business in international markets.And across diabetes, we are investing heavily in the development of multiple next-generation insulin delivery and sensor technologies. And we remain focused on restoring strong growth to this important franchise over the coming years. Turning to our Hugo surgical robot, now I am sure we are going to get into this in Q&amp;A, but we saw a lot of positive momentum this quarter as we scale manufacturing production, expand regulatory approvals and ramp installations. In addition, we just received FDA IDE approval last week on our product enhancements. Now, this allows us to start our U.S. urology clinical trial by the end of the calendar year and is a catalyst for continued progress with our international sales. Now, before I talk about our capital allocation and portfolio management, let me share my thoughts on the Ardian opportunity.Despite the impact we believe COVID and medication changes had on the ambulatory endpoint in ON MED, the totality of the data is compelling. The large drop in office blood pressure in the Ardian arm was impressive and it was consistent with what we have seen in our other trials. Importantly, the current standard of care for reducing blood pressure, it just isn't working, which was evident in the long-term SPRINT trial results published just last month in JAMA Cardiology. Patients don't seem to stay on multi-drug therapy for long periods of time and eventually just stop taking their medications. And that's the advantage of Ardian, it's always on. We have demonstrated that our Ardian procedure, it's safe, it's effective, and it's durable. Physicians are excited and Ardian is preferred by patients.Now we have submitted our PMA to the FDA and we are looking forward to working with governments and payers in the U.S. and around the world who are searching for improvements to control high blood pressure and avoid the costly and devastating consequences of this disease. In addition to advancing our pipeline, we are focused on decisively allocating capital and streamlining the company to deliver durable growth. We are freeing up resources to invest more in R&amp;D, feeding our fast growing businesses in areas where we can see the strongest returns. Cardiac ablation solutions and diabetes are two clear examples of this. We are also making moves with our portfolio to focus our company and our capital on opportunities that are better aligned with our long-term growth acceleration strategies.Over the past two quarters, we have announced our intent to separate three businesses that we believe will thrive outside the company. With our Renal Care Solutions business, we are progressing on the separation, forming a new kidney health technology company together with DaVita. We continue to expect this transaction to close in calendar 2023. And last month, we announced our intention to separate our combined patient monitoring and respiratory interventions business. We remain focused on active portfolio management, evaluating both potential additions and subtractions to further accelerate our growth and create value for our shareholders. Now with that, I will turn it over to Karen to discuss our second quarter financial performance and our guidance.Karen?Karen Parkhill: Thank you, Geoff. Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2.2%, up significantly from Q1, but below our guidance range, given the challenges Geoff mentioned. Yet with a focus on expenses, our adjusted EPS of $1.30 landed at the upper end of our guidance range. Currency had a significantly unfavorable impact of 5.8% on our reported revenue growth. Our FX hedges mitigated that impact on the bottom line with EPS down only $0.01 or 80 basis points from currency. Looking at our results from a geographic perspective, our U.S. revenue grew 1%; our non-U.S. developed increased 3%; and emerging markets grew 4%. Our emerging markets growth continued to be affected by China, which declined 9%, given the impact of a national tender in our spine business and several provincial tenders in certain other businesses.However, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in our other markets, including mid-20s growth in Eastern Europe and mid-teens growth in Latin America. In fact, excluding China, our emerging markets grew 15%. Turning to our margins, our adjusted gross margin of 67.6% declined 120 basis points from inflationary pressures in materials, direct labor, freight and utilities. We expect these inflationary pressures to continue and to impact the back half of this fiscal year, more than what we experienced in the first half. Our adjusted operating margin of 26.6% declined 40 basis points, including a 120 basis point benefit from our currency hedging program. Compared to the first quarter, our operating margin improved 270 basis points, given accelerated revenue growth.We expect sequential improvement throughout the fiscal year. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. I would note that the vast majority of our debt is fixed at low rates as we move into a higher rate environment. Regarding our capital allocation, we continue to balance investing for the future with returning capital to shareholders and we remain committed to our dividend and to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Now, turning to our guidance, today, we set our second half revenue guidance at 3.5% to 4% organic, which excludes currency movement and revenue from our Intersect ENT acquisition. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would now have a negative impact on our back half revenue of $930 million to $1.03 billion.Our back half guidance translates into a reduction of our annual guidance, driven by a slower pace of market and supply recovery. On market, we are expecting incremental provincial tenders in China, particularly in stapling and cardiac ablation. And Geoff referenced earlier that some procedure volumes in the second quarter didn't recover as quickly as we were expecting. So at this point, we are assuming no incremental improvement in the back half. On supply, while we have had a meaningful recovery, it came later than anticipated, particularly in SI and cardiac diagnostics and that simply delays our pace of recovery ahead. By segment in the back half, the majority of the reduction is in our Medical Surgical portfolio, which we now expect to be flat to up 0.5%.We expect cardiovascular to grow 5.25% to 5.75%, neuroscience to grow 6% to 6.5%, and diabetes to decline in the low single-digits, all on an organic basis. Our total company revenue guidance does assume continued revenue growth acceleration, which we saw in each month of the second quarter. We expect the third quarter growth rate to be better than the second and the fourth quarter better than the third. We will have easing comparisons in ventilators, improving supply in certain businesses like cardiac diagnostics and SI and the benefit from product launches like Evolut FX and EV-ICD. In the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the range of 2.5% to 3%, an acceleration from the second quarter. And assuming recent exchange rates hold, the third quarter would have a currency headwind between $460 million and $510 million.By segment and on an organic basis, we expect Medical Surgical to be down 2% to 2.5%, an improvement from the second quarter, given lesser event headwinds and the impact of the flu season. Cardiovascular to grow 4.75% to 5.25% on the continued rollout of Evolut FX and Linq 2, neuroscience to grow 5.75% to 6.25% improving from the prior quarter with less VBP impact in spine and diabetes to decline in the low single-digits. On the bottom line, we are driving significant expense reduction throughout the company to help offset the lower revenue and continued inflation impact and now expect fiscal 23 non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.30. That range includes an unfavorable impact of currency of approximately $0.18 at recent rates.For the third quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27, including an FX headwind of about $0.05 at recent rates. Amidst the macro environmental headwinds we face from inflation, China VBP, softer procedure volumes in certain markets and currency, we are laser-focused on driving operational and expense efficiencies. We are also committed to invest appropriately for the long-term, allocating capital to our most promising growth drivers and executing tuck-in acquisitions designed to reach more patients and create value for our shareholders. As we approach Thanksgiving, I want to share my gratitude to our employees who have been committed, particularly during these challenging times to deliver on our mission to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the world.Back to you, Geoff.Geoff Martha: Thank you, Karen. Now before we open the lines for questions, I want you to know that our growth rate and our consistency are not where we want them to be. That's why I shared with you our aggressive agenda to transform this company 2 years ago when I became CEO. We embarked on a plan of implementing a new operating model, eliminating the bureaucracy of our groups and forming more nimble operating units, while at the same time, learning to leverage our scale. We set in motion a new performance-driven culture, and we changed our incentive plans to reward new behaviors and performance. We brought in new leaders to inject new ways of thinking in the organization, and we implemented new capital allocation and portfolio management processes.Now these changes take time, and we face setbacks along the way that have slowed us down. Some are environmental like COVID recovery rates, raw material shortfalls and Chinese procurement policy, while other setbacks are of our own doing, like our quality and operational challenges and the pace of improvement we anticipated. Look, I know we have more work to do here, but we understand the root causes that led to the years of underperformance from this company. And our aggressive transformation agenda is designed to fix these issues. I know we will get this right, choosing the right markets, being more efficient and productive with our resources, empowering businesses and increasing accountability, improving our quality, our manufacturing and our supply chain and turning our size and scale into an advantage.And I know we are on the right path. The progress we've made so far gives me that confidence. We have experienced leaders, a compelling pipeline and positions of strength in some of the most attractive medtech markets, which address significant unmet needs for patients. We will execute on our plan to deliver durable growth that we began 2 years ago. And as we do, we will create tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. So now let's move to Q&amp;A. We are going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask you to limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?See also 25 Countries with Highest Fertility Rates and Oprah Winfrey Stock Portfolio.Brad Welnick: For today's session, Geoff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP &amp; President Diabetes Operating Unit; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio; Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience portfolio; and Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

116,007730a1-0840-33ee-8845-824000225146,MRK,2022-12-24,15 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-companies-offer-pensions-143402543.html,1671806042,STORY,"['PEP', 'PG', 'PFE', 'MRK', 'ABT', 'ACN', 'LLY', 'COST']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest companies that offer pensions. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions. Working for a large company comes with several benefits that are sought by those seeking stability, prestige, and career growth. One such benefit is a pension or retirement plan, which guarantees a worker an income after retiring. This rewards the worker for their loyalty to the company and ensures that they do not have to look for employment in old age after spending the best years of their life at a specific firm.There are several different kinds of retirement plans that large companies offer their employees. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), these include Individual Retirement Agreements (IRAs), 401(k) plans, SIMPLE 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) among others. Another type of pension plan is the Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP). A key difference between a pension plan and a 401(k) plan is the contribution. For a pension, it is the employer who is responsible for contributing to the plan over the course of an individual's employment, while in a 401(k) plan, it's the employee who also has to make a contribution to the plan. Over the course of the years, the 401(k) has gained popularity, but sometimes, the employer also offers to match the employee's contribution to the plan. Another key difference between the two is that pensions generally offer a fixed income for life while a 401(k) plan offers variable income.How does a pension fund afford to make regular payouts to thousands of former employees? Well, these funds are invested in the stock market, and the return is distributed among the retirees. Pension investments are among the largest on Wall Street, and assets held by the top 300 pension funds touched a whopping $23.6 trillion in September 2022, marking an 8.9% annual growth. This growth comes at a time when stock markets have been hammered by soaring inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The U.S. has the highest percentage of assets under management (AUM) for pension funds all over the globe, as it accounts for 39.6% of the top 300 funds' AUM. North America as a whole is also a dominating player, as it accounts for close to half of the total assets.Story continuesIn terms of benefits distributions, public sector retirement plans distributed $323 billion annually in 2021, and a total of roughly 6,000 plans were present in the U.S. Out of these, the vast majority were made up of locally administered plans, and some even date back to the 19th century according to the Census Bureau.While pension plans are becoming less popular, some of the world's largest firms continue to have them, with notable examples being Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco).Photo by Esther Tuttle on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a look at dozens of companies that still have pension plans, following which they were ranked according to their market capitalization.15 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions15.

You can skip our detailed analysis of scientific progress, the consequent technological benefits and 21st century scientific trends, and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Science. Science is the greatest tool required to solve some of the biggest problems humanity faces. Recently, the US Department of Energy announced a breakthrough in fusion energy. It was a net-gain in the energy output compared to the input energy that was used to heat the fuel source. The breakthrough is likely to result in increasing investment in fusion energy, accelerating further understanding and if the engineering and economic challenges are not great enough, it might lead to an effective fusion power plant by 2030. Economics of ScienceProgress in pure sciences results in the increase in technological output. For instance, the rocket equation, Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion and Newton’s laws of motion and gravitation together make space travel possible. Engineers use these laws for calculations relating to rocket design, its orbital mechanics and trajectory corrections.Technological growth, on the other hand, leads to greater economic output. In this sense, pure science is indirectly correlated to economic growth. In fact, it has been shown that correlation coefficient for Total-Factor-Productivity (TFP) and long-term economic growth in advanced economies is a strong 0.60, with technological output being one of the three main factors in TFP. Scientific Infrastructure Scientific research used to be limited to academia. However, as societies have become more complex, the infrastructure for scientific R&amp;D has also evolved, incorporating non-academic government institutes and private/public corporations as well. This is especially true in research surrounding AI. While research in the field is dominated by academia, corporate research comprises a meaningful 19.2% of the total AI papers published globally. In China and the EU, the second major share in AI-research comes from non-academic governmental institutes, at 15.6% and 17.2%, respectively. Story continuesScientific Trends, and Corporations/Institutes Dominating Them Going by the papers published by academic institutes and corporations, AI and biotechnology are the fastest growing scientific fields in the world. On Academic front, Harvard University, Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) dominate research in the US, with fractional-counts of 70.67, 39.85 and 37.69, respectively, in papers published in the Nature journal in 2018.On the corporate front, tech corporations like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominate R&amp;D in AI. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), through its subsidiary DeepMind, has designed deep learning algorithms like AlphaFold and AlphaTensor. The former has solved 98.5% of human proteins’ structures, which was a major problem for half a century. AlphaTensor, on the other hand, is designed to find novel methods for matrix multiplications, and is expected to speed up computers through discovery of new algorithms. On the other hand, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Novo Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are some of the prominent corporate names in biotechnology. Some of the biggest advances in science are happening in countries like the United States and Germany. Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of most advanced countries in science, we’ve ranked them based on the h-index score for their papers in 2021. The h-index measures the aggregate impact of scholarly output.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has awarded the deal.Details of the DealValued at $117.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will execute inspections, modifications and repairs on the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G jets.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.6% from the 2021 reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.62%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 4.1% from the 2021 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have lost 7.9% in the past 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 2.3%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On that day, Southern Co. is projected to report earnings of $0.24 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 33.33%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.04 billion, up 4.67% from the year-ago period.SO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.58 per share and revenue of $27.09 billion.

126,0a4b9440-95d5-3ac3-94b3-044e49d0e69b,SO,2022-12-24,3 Electric Utility Stocks With Safe Dividends Even in Severe Recessions,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-electric-utility-stocks-safe-190207044.html,1671562927,STORY,"['ED', 'SO', 'EVRG']","[The current macro environment is challenging for stock market investors. The ongoing war in Ukraine, supply chain disruptions in China and rising interest rates have clouded the picture for the U.S. and global economy. The S&amp;P 500 is currently down 19% year-to-date as a result. In an environment like this, many investors are looking for stocks that are crisis-proven and have a high likelihood of maintaining their dividends, no matter what.Electric utilities can be a good industry to look for such stocks, as electricity demand, at least by consumers, is not very cyclical, and generally holds up well even during major economic downturns. Customers still use electricity for heating and cooling their homes, for cooking, and so on, regardless of economic conditions.In this report, we’ll showcase three electric utilities that have not only resilient business models but have also proven that their dividends are safe during severe recessions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEDConsolidation Edison$94.59SOSouthern Company$69.86EVRGEvergy$61.89Consolidated Edison (ED)Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit upSource: ShutterstockConsolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) is a major electric utility in the United States. With a market capitalization of $34 billion, it belongs to the larger players in its industry. Most of its customers are located in New York City and the surrounding areas.Consolidated Edison has a very solid track record when it comes to being resilient versus downturns, although its growth rate has not been especially high in the past. Over the last decade, its earnings per share grew at a low-single-digit rate, but the largest drawdown was in the single digits only.This resilience has allowed Consolidated Edison to be very consistent with its dividend payments. In fact, the company has increased its dividend an outstanding 48 years in a row, making it a Dividend Aristocrat and a soon-to-be Dividend King.The company continued to increase its dividend during all types of macro environments, which includes the pandemic, the Great Recession, the bursting of the dot-com bubble and so on. We thus feel confident that Consolidated Edison would also keep its dividend growth track record in place if the U.S. experiences a major economic downturn next year.Story continuesBased on EPS expectations for the current year, Consolidated Edison will pay out 70% of its profits this year. It would take a large earnings pullback for its payout ratio to rise to 100%, and even if that were to happen, Consolidated Edison could keep its dividend in place until profits rise back to the current level.Not a lot of earnings growth can be expected from Consolidated Edison, but the dividend, which yields 3.3%, is secure and will most likely continue to grow over time.Southern Company (SO)multiple powerline towers are shown against a sunset and a distant city skylineSource: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.comSouthern Company (NYSE:SO) is an electric utility that is focused on markets such as Georgia, Tennessee and so on, where it sells electricity and natural gas to around nine million customers. With a market capitalization of $75 billion, Southern Company is the third-largest player in its industry in the United States.Like Consolidated Edison, it operates with a resilient, non-cyclical business model. In fact, its earnings growth track record is even better than that of its New York-based peer, as Consolidated Edison managed to grow its EPS during every single year of the last decade, except for 2016, when it pulled back by 0.3%.This excellent consistency has allowed Southern Company to reward shareholders with growing dividends over time. The company has increased its dividend for 21 years in a row. That does not yet make Southern Company a Dividend Aristocrat, but the company nevertheless has proven its ability to increase shareholder returns during tough times, including during the pandemic and the Great Recession.Southern Company currently trades with a dividend yield of 4%, which is more than twice the broad market’s dividend yield. Based on expected EPS for the current year, Southern Company’s dividend payout ratio is 75%, which is not low but very reasonable for a company with resilient profits.Investors should not expect too much EPS growth from Southern Company going forward, but a 4%-5% annual growth rate seems achievable, considering the company’s past performance. In addition with a safe dividend yield of 4%, that makes Southern Company look attractive.Evergy (EVRG)the Evergy logo seen displayed on a smartphone EVRG stockSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comEvergy (NYSE:EVRG) is an electric utility as well, although a much smaller one compared to Consolidated Edison and Southern Company. The company trades with a market capitalization of $14 billion today. Evergy is active in Kansas and Missouri, where it serves around 1.5 million residential customers and 200,000 commercial customers.Its business is seasonal, as electricity demand is higher during the summer months due to customers using more electricity for heating during those months. The third quarter thus usually is Evergy’s strongest quarter by far. On a year-to-year basis, this does not impact results, however, and Evergy has proven to be resilient when we look at its annual profits.Over the last decade, there were some years where earnings pulled back by a little more than 10%, such as in 2015. But overall, that still makes for a pretty low-risk business model. Its somewhat more elevated EPS pullback risk, relative to ED and SO, is balanced out by a stronger earnings growth rate, as Evergy has grown its EPS at the highest rate among these three companies, looking back over the last decade.At current prices, Evergy offers a dividend yield of 3.9%, which is quite attractive. The dividend payout ratio is a little below 70% today, which is very reasonable. Evergy has an 18-year dividend growth track record, which is not quite as pronounced compared to Southern Company and Consolidated Edison, but which still easily covers past downturns such as the Great Recession.Evergy is slightly more cyclical compared to its larger peers, but its dividend is still safe and reliable. The above-average growth rate could be attractive for investors as well, as it has a positive impact on Evergy’s total return potential over the coming years, relative to a slower-growing electric utility such as Consolidated Edison.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

UNH, Cigna Corp. CI, Humana Inc. HUM and Centene Corp. CNC.Industry: Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2031334/4-hmo-stocks-in-focus-despite-tech-costs-nursing-shortageThe U.S. health insurance industry, commonly referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is likely to be aided by continued growth in premiums, a solid customer base and consistent contract wins. Despite its solid prospects, the industry has been grappling with escalating costs resulting from continued investments to bolster digital capabilities.A shortage of nurses and inflationary pressure continue to hamper the efficacies of HMO industry players. In spite of the prevailing challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc., Cigna Corp., Humana Inc. and Centene Corp. are better placed to navigate the industry downsides.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of its subscribers' basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance.Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO IndustryTechnology Investments Amid a Growing Digital Era: Players in the HMO space are compelled to undertake significant technology investments to stay abreast with the ongoing digital trend. These investments are often directed toward developing telehealth platforms through which the operational efficiencies of healthcare providers receive a boost. Telehealth platforms have exhibited solid demand since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as these offered healthcare services within the comfort of one's home.Story continuesThere are no signs of the demand receding and therefore it seems prudent on the part of HMO players to undertake digital investments. However, bringing its share of worries, these investments might escalate costs and dampen the margins of health insurers.Nursing Shortage: A notable headwind that has been troubling the U.S. healthcare industry for quite some is an acute shortage of nurses. Health insurers collaborate with several hospitals, as a result of which health plan members of the former can avail hospital treatments at discounted rates. Thereby, health insurers have to depend on nurses and other medical personnel for providing quality managed care services at hospitals per the unique needs of their clients.In the absence of a sufficient nursing workforce, a hospital's ability to deliver quality services might get affected, which, in turn, may indirectly impact the customer base of a health insurer. A McKinsey report, forecasting that the United States might witness a shortage of 200,000 to 450,000 nurses within 2025, further highlights the dismal scenario that awaits health insurers.Well-Performing Government Business: The health insurers devise affordable Medicare, Medicaid and Marketplace plans as part of the government business. Frequently, health plans are upgraded with attractive features to retain existing customers as well as attract new ones. Additionally, the HMO players remain on a spree to come up with advanced health plans as that might win them federal or state contracts from time to time.This, in turn, bolsters the customer base and leads to a steady rise in premiums. Increasing premiums bode well for the top line. However, amid the continued inflationary headwind that often takes a toll on the spending habits of consumers, the ability of consumers to continue paying for health plan premiums remains uncertain to some extent.An Aging U.S. Population: While an aging U.S. population might have been one of the factors contributing to the nationwide nursing scarcity issue, it has definitely been a blessing in disguise for health insurers offering Medicare plans. Meant to benefit people aged 65 or above, Medicare plans are expected to remain in solid demand on account of a growing aging population across the United States.According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, around 16.9% of the American population was aged 65 years or above in 2020 and the percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. In an effort to bolster the Medicare customer base, the industry participants even operate senior-focused centers for delivering quality care services to the medically vulnerable population.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group's  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical  sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #217, which places it in the bottom 12% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can buy or retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it's worth taking a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has gained 5.5% against the S&amp;P 500's 20.2% decline and the Zacks Medical sector's decrease of 20.1%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 19.33X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 17.01X and the sector's 22.45X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.48X and as low as 19.32X, with the median being at 20.2X.4 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting four stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Considering the current industry scenario, it might be prudent for investors to buy or retain these stocks in their portfolio, as these are well-placed to generate growth in the long haul.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.UnitedHealth Group: Based in Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group continues to benefit on the back of strong performances exhibited by its UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments. Several contract wins have resulted in membership growth for UNH. A solid financial position empowers UNH to undertake growth-related investments, which aim to expand its capabilities and solidify its nationwide presence. The healthcare provider has a solid telehealth platform in place that it has developed through continuous partnerships and significant investments. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have gained 6.5% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH's 2022 EPS indicates a 15.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues indicates a 12.6% improvement from the year-ago actual. The bottom line of UnitedHealth Group outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average beat being 4.60%.Cigna: This Connecticut-based health insurer continues to benefit from the robust performances of its two well-positioned growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. It remains on track to achieve 10-13% average annual adjusted EPS growth on a long-term basis. CI's Government business is driven by continuous product expansions, rising membership and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems. Its shares have surged 47.5% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna's 2022 EPS indicates a 13% increase, while the same for revenues suggests 3.2% growth from the corresponding year-ago reported figures. CI's earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 9.84%.Humana: Growing premium revenues arising from an increasing customer base across its Medicaid and Medicare businesses continue to drive revenues of Kentucky-based Humana. The strength of the cost-effective Medicaid and Medicare health plans devised by HUM has fetched numerous contract wins and renewed agreements from Ohio, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin for the company. The CenterWell brand, together with Conviva, is part of Humana's Primary Care Organization, which is one of the largest senior-focused primary care providers in the United States. The stock has rallied 10.3% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HUM's 2022 EPS indicates a 21.4% increase from the prior-year reported number, while the same for revenues suggests growth of 11.9%. Humana's earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 10.41%.Centene: Based in Missouri, Centene's government business won numerous contracts in 2022. Notably, U.S. states like Louisiana, Indiana and Missouri, among others, awarded Centene Medicaid contracts. A strong cash reserve and a robust cash-generating ability to pursue growth-related initiatives. In December 2022, reflecting one of its growth-related investments, CNC collaborated with Community Health Development (CHDI) to establish a new community center in Texas for providing primary medical care and behavioral health services across the state. Even though its shares have lost 3.2% in a year, CNC's strong fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene's 2022 EPS indicates an 11.1% increase from the year-earlier reading. The consensus mark for current-year revenues indicates a 14.7% improvement from the year-ago actual. The bottom line of CNC outpaced earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 5.22%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has awarded the deal.Details of the DealValued at $117.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will execute inspections, modifications and repairs on the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G jets.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.6% from the 2021 reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.62%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 4.1% from the 2021 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have lost 7.9% in the past 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 2.3%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

131,5882a2e2-def4-3618-84f5-5e3010d4e703,NKE,2022-12-24,Don't Get Too Optimistic About Nike's Earnings Beat,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-too-optimistic-nikes-earnings-171056471.html,1671815456,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike released its fiscal second-quarter 2023 financial report last week and unveiled enormously positive results. The company's revenue surged 17.3% year -over year, beating analysts' average target by $740 million. Moreover, the company saw reduced input cost pressure, which resulted in a 21 cents per share earnings beat versus estimates.Doing a deeper dive into Nike's second-quarter earnings report illustrates the company's ongoing organic growth. Nike Direct sales surged by 25% year over year, its wholesale sales jumped by 30% and digital sales gained an incredible 34% during the three-month period.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. NKE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NKEPeter Lynch Chart of NKEMuch of Nike's organic growth is due to increased digitalization. The company's omnichannel sales strategy provides consumers with a more convenient shopping experience as they can view, pay and select their delivery methods bespoke to their needs. In addition, Nike's improved consumer targeting and inventory management is a result of better data analytics, which could see the company continue to grow its income statement in the coming years.Despite Nike's outstanding second quarter financial results, though, I have reservations over the company and the stock's medium-term prospects; here's why.Recession risk and accrualsAlthough Nike has trumped its earnings targets in successive quarters, the company has failed to deliver adequate earnings per share results during four of its last 12 quarters, suggesting its stock might be susceptible to the risk of crashing in a recession.Stock price momentum can be measured cross-sectionally or by a time series regression. The latter defines a stock's price momentum in isolation and is often caused by a company's earnings momentum. Nike's earnings crash risk is likely a feature of its cyclicality and could hinder the stock's long-term trajectory.Story continuesIn addition, the company is exposed to emerging markets, which might act as a liability as emerging markets are at greater risk of recession. The strong U.S. dollar is also heavily discounting emerging market revenues for Nike.Nike's Beneish M-Score of -2.3 is good news to investors. The Beneish M-score metric measures the aggressiveness of a company's accounting metrics. As a rule of thumb, a company's accounting practices are considered conservative whenever its M-Score is below -1.78. This indicates it is not likely to be artificially manipulating its financial numbers.Don't Get Too Optimistic About Nike's Earnings BeatDespite Nike's favorable Beneish M-score, I still have reservations about its accruals. Nike's excess accruals suggest that its income statement isn't in line with its tangible cash movements. A deeper dive into the retail giant's financial statement line items indicates that it has reduced its receivables and inventory. The prior isn't of much concern because a receivables overload can be considered as ""masking uncollectables."" However, the latter is worrisome as it could mean that Nike anticipates lower demand for its products going into 2023.Valuation and dividend analysisNike's valuation metrics are severely unfavorable, especially after the stock price spiked following the latest positive earnings report. A discounted cash flow model (DCF) suggests that the stock is tremendously overpriced in the marketplace. A DCF model works by discounting a company's estimated future cash flows (minus a discount rate to account for the value of money decreasing over time) to arrive at a fair value estimate for its stock. Below is a screenshot of my results from the GuruFocus DCF calculator; I estimated a growth rate of 11.1% for the next 10 years for the stock, with a discount rate of 10%. Even with such an optimistic growth projection, the stock still looks overvalued.Don't Get Too Optimistic About Nike's Earnings BeatFurthermore, Nike's stock is trading at 11.96 times its book value, indicating that its ordinary shareholders own little residual value. Nike is a mature company; thus, its price multiples speak volumes.Lastly, Nike's stock provides little worth in terms of dividends. The stock's forward dividend yield of 1.17% is accompanied by a dividend coverage ratio of 2.44. Although Nike's coverage ratio is relatively reasonable, it doesn't suggest that the company could ramp up its dividend payments anytime soon.Don't Get Too Optimistic About Nike's Earnings BeatVolatility and technical analysisVolatility analysis measures a stock's sensitivity to broader indices and their sub-sections. In this case, Nike's beta coefficient of 1.14x means its stock is 1.14 times as volatile as the S&amp;P 500. The broad-based opinion on Wall Street is that a recession is due in 2023, which could deter Nike stock's prospects as a high-beta asset.Regression analysis shows that low-beta, high-dividend, quality and value stocks have outperformed the broader market during 2022's bear market. The market is yet to pivot from its risk-off environment, which could see the same segments outperform in 2023.Don't Get Too Optimistic About Nike's Earnings BeatSource: KoyfinAlthough an argument can be drawn for quality, Nike doesn't fall into any of the other mentioned segments as its beta coefficient, price multiples and dividend profile are all unfavorable. Thus, there's no technical evidence supporting a 2023 Nike stock recovery.Concluding thoughtsNike's second-quarter earnings results displayed the company's robust organic growth. The company has also shed nearly 30% of its market value since the turn of the year, leading many to believe its stock is oversold. However, history indicates that Nike is susceptible to earnings crash risk, which could dent its prospects. Furthermore, Nike stock is severely overvalued even after this year's declines and doesn't provide an overly impressive dividend profile.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

These traits have been the key burdens on the participating companies’ profits. Additionally, adverse currency movements threaten the industry players due to their worldwide presence.However, the industry players are well-poised to benefit from the favorable health and wellness trends, which have been boosting the demand for activewear and athletic shoes. The new and innovative designs, along with increased consumer awareness about leading a healthy lifestyle, will likely continue aiding sales of fitness clothes and footwear. The industry players, focused on product innovation, store expansion, digital investments and omni-channel growth, are expected to gain.The industry participants have been investing in product innovation to gain market share. Investments in products and e-commerce portals bode well for players like NIKE Inc. NKE, Deckers Outdoor DECK, Skechers SKX and Caleres CAL.About the IndustryThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry comprises companies that design, source and market clothing, footwear and accessories for men, women and children under various brand names. Product offerings of the companies mostly include athletic and casual footwear, fashion apparel and activewear, sports equipment, bags, balls, and other sports and fashion accessories. The companies showcase their products through their branded outlets and websites. Some companies distribute products via other retail stores such as national chains, online retailers, sporting goods stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.A Look at What's Shaping Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry's FutureCost Headwinds: Companies in the industry are witnessing elevated costs due to factors like commodity cost inflation, increased freight costs, reinvestments and other impacts. Supply-chain constraints, extended transit times, and elevated ocean freight and logistic costs have been acting as deterrents. A number of companies expect increased freight and logistic costs to hurt margins in the near term. Elevated marketing expenses, higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses, and increased investments to enhance store and digital operations have been raising SG&amp;A costs. Also, the industry participants are witnessing higher costs to support brand campaigns and digital investments. The exit from the Russia business due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict and COVID-related disruptions in some parts of Greater China are likely to be the key concerns for some players. A tough and competitive labor market remains another concern. These factors pose a threat to the industry players’ margins.Consumer Demand Trends: Players in the industry have been benefiting from strong consumer demand for activewear/athleisure products and footwear, which is expected to persist in 2023. Athletic goods and apparel companies offer products from footwear, sweatshirts, leggings, pants, jackets and tops to yoga wear and running clothes for men and women. The increasing fashion sense is boosting the demand for innovative clothes and footwear in the United States. The industry participants have been focused on product innovations, active promotions, store expansion and enhancing e-commerce capabilities to gain market share. Favorable health &amp; wellness trends have been the key to inspiring footwear manufacturers to expand their product portfolio. The companies continue to innovate styles, materials and colors, and incorporate functional designs to grab a large share of the fast-growing market. Moreover, multi-functional shoes that cater to casual and formal looks have been gaining popularity. The increased participation of women in sports and outdoor activities in recent years has been a boon for the industry players.E-Commerce Investments: E-commerce has been playing a crucial role in the athleisure market’s growth. The companies in the segment are looking to build a customer base through websites, social media and other digital channels. As consumers continue to shop from home, growth of athletic-inspired apparel and digital sales are likely to continue. Companies focused on expanding their athletic-based apparel lines and building on e-commerce capabilities are expected to witness growth in the long run. Efforts to accelerate deliveries through investments in supply chains and order fulfillment avenues are likely to provide an edge to the industry players. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts, as well as mobile point-of-sale capabilities, to make stores attractive. The efforts to enhance experiences through multiple channels are likely to contribute significantly to improving traffic and transactions both in stores and online.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is an 11-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), these include Individual Retirement Agreements (IRAs), 401(k) plans, SIMPLE 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) among others. Another type of pension plan is the Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP). A key difference between a pension plan and a 401(k) plan is the contribution. For a pension, it is the employer who is responsible for contributing to the plan over the course of an individual's employment, while in a 401(k) plan, it's the employee who also has to make a contribution to the plan. Over the course of the years, the 401(k) has gained popularity, but sometimes, the employer also offers to match the employee's contribution to the plan. Another key difference between the two is that pensions generally offer a fixed income for life while a 401(k) plan offers variable income.How does a pension fund afford to make regular payouts to thousands of former employees? Well, these funds are invested in the stock market, and the return is distributed among the retirees. Pension investments are among the largest on Wall Street, and assets held by the top 300 pension funds touched a whopping $23.6 trillion in September 2022, marking an 8.9% annual growth. This growth comes at a time when stock markets have been hammered by soaring inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The U.S. has the highest percentage of assets under management (AUM) for pension funds all over the globe, as it accounts for 39.6% of the top 300 funds' AUM. North America as a whole is also a dominating player, as it accounts for close to half of the total assets.Story continuesIn terms of benefits distributions, public sector retirement plans distributed $323 billion annually in 2021, and a total of roughly 6,000 plans were present in the U.S. Out of these, the vast majority were made up of locally administered plans, and some even date back to the 19th century according to the Census Bureau.While pension plans are becoming less popular, some of the world's largest firms continue to have them, with notable examples being Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco).Photo by Esther Tuttle on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a look at dozens of companies that still have pension plans, following which they were ranked according to their market capitalization.15 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions15.

You can skip our detailed analysis of scientific progress, the consequent technological benefits and 21st century scientific trends, and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Science. Science is the greatest tool required to solve some of the biggest problems humanity faces. Recently, the US Department of Energy announced a breakthrough in fusion energy. It was a net-gain in the energy output compared to the input energy that was used to heat the fuel source. The breakthrough is likely to result in increasing investment in fusion energy, accelerating further understanding and if the engineering and economic challenges are not great enough, it might lead to an effective fusion power plant by 2030. Economics of ScienceProgress in pure sciences results in the increase in technological output. For instance, the rocket equation, Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion and Newton’s laws of motion and gravitation together make space travel possible. Engineers use these laws for calculations relating to rocket design, its orbital mechanics and trajectory corrections.Technological growth, on the other hand, leads to greater economic output. In this sense, pure science is indirectly correlated to economic growth. In fact, it has been shown that correlation coefficient for Total-Factor-Productivity (TFP) and long-term economic growth in advanced economies is a strong 0.60, with technological output being one of the three main factors in TFP. Scientific Infrastructure Scientific research used to be limited to academia. However, as societies have become more complex, the infrastructure for scientific R&amp;D has also evolved, incorporating non-academic government institutes and private/public corporations as well. This is especially true in research surrounding AI. While research in the field is dominated by academia, corporate research comprises a meaningful 19.2% of the total AI papers published globally. In China and the EU, the second major share in AI-research comes from non-academic governmental institutes, at 15.6% and 17.2%, respectively. Story continuesScientific Trends, and Corporations/Institutes Dominating Them Going by the papers published by academic institutes and corporations, AI and biotechnology are the fastest growing scientific fields in the world. On Academic front, Harvard University, Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) dominate research in the US, with fractional-counts of 70.67, 39.85 and 37.69, respectively, in papers published in the Nature journal in 2018.On the corporate front, tech corporations like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominate R&amp;D in AI. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), through its subsidiary DeepMind, has designed deep learning algorithms like AlphaFold and AlphaTensor. The former has solved 98.5% of human proteins’ structures, which was a major problem for half a century. AlphaTensor, on the other hand, is designed to find novel methods for matrix multiplications, and is expected to speed up computers through discovery of new algorithms. On the other hand, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Novo Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are some of the prominent corporate names in biotechnology. Some of the biggest advances in science are happening in countries like the United States and Germany. Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of most advanced countries in science, we’ve ranked them based on the h-index score for their papers in 2021. The h-index measures the aggregate impact of scholarly output. An h-index of 20 implies that for all publications by a researcher, 20 of them have been cited by other researchers at-least 20 times.According to Dr. Jorge E. Hirsch, an American physics professor and the pioneer of h-index, an h-index of 20 is usually considered good, 40 is considered outstanding, while an h-index of 60 can be thought of as exceptional.For the number of papers in 2021 and their h index, we’ve sourced the data from SCImago Country Rankings.We’ve also mentioned the respective countries’ top academic institutes. The results come from SCImago Institutions Ranking. Further, we’ve discussed the R&amp;D share of countries’ GDPs and sourced the data from the World Bank.12.

Axios reporting Bloomberg is eyeing either ""Wall Street Journal"" parent company Dow Jones or the ""Washington Post,"" which is currently owned by Jeff Bezos.Allie Canal joining us now with the latest. Allie, what are we learning?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, that's right, David. According to this Axios report, Bloomberg is most interested in that Dow Jones acquisition due to its all-encompassing business coverage. You mentioned how Dow Jones is the parent company of the ""Wall Street Journal"" but also ""Barron's"" and MarketWatch. So pretty notable franchises there, especially within the finance world. However, the report did indicate that Bloomberg would be willing to purchase the ""Washington Post"" if Bezos was willing to sell.Yahoo Finance did reach out to both Dow Jones and the ""Washington Post."" A spokesperson for Dow Jones declined to comment, and the ""Post"" did not immediately respond.But another interesting layer to this story is the relationship between Michael Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch owns News Corp, which is the parent company of Dow Jones. He is close with Bloomberg. And we did receive a report back in October that Murdoch was considering a recombination of News Corp and Fox, which last split in 2013. Bloomberg, though, at least according to Axios, believes this recombination will fail, thus creating a possible opening, although he reportedly has not yet spoken to Murdoch about his interest.So it seems like this is still very early days but definitely something to watch heading into 2023.JARED BLIKRE: And, Allie, thinking about what else in the M&amp;A space may happen in media in 2023, just wondering what's on your radar? Because if I think back over the last 20 years, it seems like there's a major reshuffling about once every 10 years. That kind of occurs with the business cycle. You see a bunch of combinations, a bunch of split ups. What are we seeing for the new year?Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: I think we're definitely entering that period, Jared. There are signs that there's going to be more mergers and acquisitions in 2023. We've seen this push to profits, increased competition, companies just bleeding money, especially those traditional print entities, and M&amp;A is often looked at as a viable solution to those problems. Of course, the interest-rate environment, that could create some headwinds. But Wall Street is going to be on all of these companies' tails amid that profitability push.So other possible acquisitions to look out for could include Paramount Global unloading along with some of those smaller players like WWE, Curiosity Stream, Chicken Soup for the Soul, and then Disney. What are they going to do with Hulu and ESPN?So there is certainly a reckoning across the industry. The stock market has wiped $500 billion plus off of the media sector this year alone, and everything's on the table when it comes to this industry to try to recover from that and survive in the new year.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Allie Canal, good to see you. Thanks so much.]"

143,762508d4-fe32-3acd-ad79-3ab1d51f7d1e,PYPL,2022-12-24,Top 15 Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-buy-now-pay-192036009.html,1671823236,STORY,['PYPL'],"[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 15 buy now pay later (BNPL) companies in the U.S. For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Companies in the U.S. The modern day financial industry allows consumers to have access to credit if they want to make purchases without wanting to immediately pay. This offers several benefits such as ensuring that a product or service is of the right quality before a payment is made, or to make a payment before a paycheck or other funds arrive. Traditionally, banks have offered their customers credit cards to make purchases at the start of the month and then clear the amount later - typically at the end of the month or the year.However, getting a credit card often requires a hefty background check and a strong credit history, especially when first time applicants are considered. Banks take a risk in providing loans to their customers, and they conduct thorough analyses to ensure that their debtors will be able to pay back their loans. A new industry that has sprung up to bridge this gap between traditional financial institutions and the everyday consumer is the buy now pay later (BNPL) industry. This industry is made up of companies that offer the ability to make purchases or payments without having the cash upfront. The user can then make monthly payments, with or without an interest rate (depending on the company) and for either products or services such as healthcare or rent.In terms of industry size, the BNPL segment is one of the fastest growing industries that you are likely to come across. Some of the hottest growing industries these days are biotechnology and 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) and the BNPL is ahead of both of these when its estimated compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is taken into account. For instance, a research report from Allied Market Research outlines that the industry was worth $90 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a stunning CAGR of 45.7% between then and 2030 to sit at a whopping $3.98 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Bifurcating the market into product types and geographies, the research firm shares that retail purchases made through BNPL platforms make up for the largest portion of the market but payment for services such as healthcare will be the fastest grower. It adds that Asia will be a strong grower in the future, as the rising cost of daily use appliances will entice customers to move towards BNPL.Story continuesAnother report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, is more muted when estimating the market's growth rate and size. It pegs the 2021 industry value at $15 billion and believes that by the end of this year, the BNPL market will be worth $22.86 billion. From then until 2029, the industry will grow at a 21.7% CAGR and be worth $90 billion by the end of the forecast period.Today's piece will zero in on the BNPL companies that offer their services in America. Some top players are Four, Zip, and Splitit.Top 15 Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Companies in the U.S.Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology We sifted through the dozens of buy now pay later (BNPL) companies that are offering their services globally to narrow down those that also target Americans. These companies are ranked through their annual percentage rate (APR) which is the interest rate on a loan for the whole year. The list is ranked in descending order of APR, and the highest APR charged is used. Often, consumers are offered lower APRs, but for the sake of comparison, a worst case scenario is assumed. Additionally, APR is not the only fee charged by BNPLs, and other charges such as those for using cards may come as a surprise to consumers. Finally, several companies on our list do not charge an APR; instead, they have late payment fees. This has been clarified where applicable, and a link to the firms' payment terms has also been added when possible.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -5.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 3.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $3.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.69 indicates a change of +6.3% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.49 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.32 billion and $59.9 billion estimates indicate -16.2% and +1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.9%. EPS of $1.81 for the same period compares with $2.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.72%. The EPS surprise was +1.69%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

They have an incredibly strong balance sheet to weather a recession. And on the other side, they are destined to increase their leadership in EVs, which we think are on the cusp of really penetrating penetrating the overall auto market,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).In a new note to clients, Gianarikas called Tesla (TSLA) a sustainability ""behemoth"" — pointing to leadership positions in EVs and in solar with SolarCity. The analyst sees fair value for Tesla's stock at $275, up sizably from its current price of $123 in midday Friday trading.Gianarikas acknowledged, however, that the near-term is uncertain on Tesla.""The near-term is incredibly uncertain. But it's being reflected in the stock. Sometimes stocks tend to bottom before the fundamentals do. So when we look out to the long-term, there is a lot of earnings power here. The company has lots of growth vectors, whether it's EVs, semis, robotics — we are very positive in the long-term,"" Gianarikas added.Tesla's bumpy road.To be sure, many other investors and analysts have lined up against bullish takes on the one-time popular momentum trade of Tesla this year.The stock has plunged around 65% year to date, and 26% in the past month alone amid demand concerns and Musk's unpredictable leadership over at Twitter.

148,3d8a862d-d347-4e07-a16f-8fd96618cc0f,GM,2022-12-24,Why 2023 could be the year of the cheap—or cheaper—EV,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-2023-could-be-the-year-of-the-cheapor-cheaper-ev-170025733.html,1671814825,STORY,"['TM', 'TOYOF', 'TSLA', 'FSR', 'RIVN', 'GM', 'LCID', 'F']","[It’s been, uh, an electrifying year for EVs in America.Next year could be even better, largely because of a slew of less expensive EVs, which will hit the market along with some new government rules that will make even pricey models affordable.First, a 2022 overview: Despite supply chain issues and inflation, EV market share nearly doubled in the U.S. In the first ten months of 2022, for instance, EVs accounted for 5.3% of all vehicles sold, compared with 2.9% last year. According to data from Experian, new EV registrations hit 604,638, more than 60% higher when compared with the same period a year ago. (That trend isn't going to change, apparently. Analysts like Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley see EV share hitting 11% by 2025.)All that growth is happening despite the fact that most new EVs sales are in the upper tier, $50,000+ price range. “There is still a lot of room to grow in the top half of the segment to achieve portfolio targets without a sub-$30k offering for at least the next decade,” said Bill Newman, SAP North America Head of Automotive to Yahoo Finance.But the easiest way to grow that EV number, beyond expanding EV charging networks and increasing incentives (which we’ll get too), is offering up more affordable EVs. It's no mystery why. Cars.com’s end-of-year buyers' survey finds that for both male and female consumers, price was the top drawback. Initial cost is the number one concern for 61% of men and 57% of women, per the automotive sales website.But that sticker shock could be coming to an end. Here’s why 2023 could be the year we’ll see cheaper EVs. Consider:New competition from older brands2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV 3LT (credit: GM)To be sure, there are cheap EVs on the market now. Chevrolet’s Bolt EV is back on sale after a hiatus due to a big battery recall, Nissan’s Leaf has been out for many years, and Hyundai’s Kona Electric has been on sale since 2021. All have starting prices around $30,000.However the Kona Electric and Nissan Leaf have smaller batteries and limited range. The Bolt is a solid option in the sub $30,000, 250-mile range. And with EV stalwart Tesla not offering anything near that price, there isn’t much in the cheap EV space.Story continuesBut...that’s changing.GM’s (GM) big EV rollout starts in 2023, one that will see the brand debut its Chevrolet Equinox EV, which the automaker says will start around $30,000. Along with the Bolt EV, GM will then have two crossover-style SUVs in that $30K price range.The Chevrolet Blazer EV will come out later in the summer, with prices starting around $45,000 before any incentives. GM will then have its Silverado EV pickup in production in spring of next year, though the cheaper work truck version of the pickup (starting around $39,900) will likely arrive in the back half of 2023.The new 2023 Toyota bZ4X electric car is displayed Thursday, Feb. 10, 2022, as the Chicago Auto Show returns to McCormick Place. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)Toyota (TM), which was late to the EV scene and is still mired in an electrification strategy overhaul, finally has its bZ4X hitting showrooms now after being delayed this spring. Though quantities are limited at this time, the car starts around $43,000 and will be rolling out in force next year.Speaking of delayed cars, Nissan will also have its well-received Ariya CUV EV coming to US showrooms—finally— in early 2023. The Ariya, a joint design project with Nissan teams in Japan and Europe, features a sleek design and almost-luxury level interior in higher trims.The Ariya in entry level Engage trim starts at a reasonable $43,190.And let’s not forget Volkswagen (VOW.DE), the number two car maker behind Toyota. VW’s ID.4 EV has been out in the U.S. since 2021, with nearly 17,000 sold since then. The ID.4 starts at a very reasonable $37,495, and it will soon be joined by its quirky stablemate, the ID.Buzz van starting in 2024.Fisker and Tesla A Fisker Ocean is displayed during the 2021 LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November, 17, 2021. REUTERS/Mike BlakeWhile the traditional automakers are coming onboard, upstart Fisker (FSR), led by the contagiously energetic Henrik Fisker, is aiming for a big 2023.The Fisker Ocean EV SUV is already in production at its plant in Graz, Austria. While the initial “Ocean One” launch model will be the pricey $69,000 version, we’ll see other models come out next year including the entry level “Ocean Sport,” which will start at $37,499.Will Tesla finally weigh in with a lower-priced EV?Tesla (TSLA) operates in the premium luxury space; its cheapest offering is the Model 3 rear-wheel drive sedan at $46,990. CEO Elon Musk has claimed he will finally reveal the company’s sub $30,000 robotaxi next year. But it likely won’t go into production for at least a year.IRA effectHONOLULU, UNITED STATES - 2020/03/05: Customers admire a Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle at a Tesla store. (Photo by Alex Tai/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Consumers can also get at a cheaper EV thanks to some tweaks by lawmakers in the U.S.While the Inflation Reduction Act’s consumer tax credit for EVs is currently in effect for cars assembled in North America, some coming changes will benefit two big automakers - Tesla and GM.Tesla and GM are currently phased out of the tax credit based on older rules, but starting on January 1st the two automakers will be allowed to participate again in the program, with buyers getting the full $7,500 off of qualified EVs. That's party due to the Treasury Department delaying a domestic materials requirement for batteries. (For more, click here.) LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 18: The first ever all-electric Chevrolet Silverado EV is on display at the 2022 Los Angeles Auto Show on November 18, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Josh Lefkowitz/Getty Images)This is all good news for Tesla and GM. The Tesla Model 3 rear-wheel drive, with the full federal tax credit of $7,500, would be below $40K. And GM’s Bolt EV and upcoming Equinox could start at prices well under $30K. Both Tesla and GM can produce these models in mass quantity (with GM actually increasing production of the Bolt for next year.)Others that will ride the wave of the IRA: the Ford F-150 Lightning Pro and the upcoming Silverado EV work truck, the cheapest EV pickups in the market in 2023.In addition, the IRA allows commercial vehicles to qualify for the full-tax credit, regardless of manufacturing location. The Lightning, Silverado, Ford’s E-transit electric van, and even Mercedes' eSprinter Van and others used for commercial purposes for a business would qualify for the full credit, bringing those sales down even further.Bottom line: the era of the cheap, or cheaper, EV may be upon us.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Google (GOOGL) took second with roughly $4.7 billion in tax breaks, followed by Meta (META) at $3.8 billion, Intel (INTC) at almost $3.3 billion, and FedEx (FDX) at $3.2 billion.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The 23 companies paid a combined $78.6 billion in federal corporate income taxes during that time, which was 8.9% of their $886.6 billion in reported profits. The standard corporate tax rate is 21%.On an individual level, the tax rates varied widely. For example, Duke Energy (DUK) had a negative tax rate of -10.6%, General Motors (GM) paid 0.2%, and Target's (TGT) rate was 15.9%.'The indirect effect' of reducing government revenueThe origins of the bonus depreciation tax cut began with a decade-old federal income tax law known as “accelerated depreciation,” which allows businesses to file for subsidized taxes for equipment not used as often and nearing old age.Then-President Trump took it a step further with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), creating the ""bonus depreciation"" law.From 2018 to 2021, the “bonus depreciation” law gave corporations additional tax breaks with the existing accelerated depreciation law. Companies could receive a full tax deduction the same year they purchased equipment or assets instead of making smaller deductions over a longer period of time as the equipment wore out.Story continuesFacebook/Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is seen in attendance during the UFC Fight Night event at UFC APEX on October 1, 2022, in Las Vegas. (Photo by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC)According to public accountants at Blue &amp; Co., there are pros and cons to utilizing 100% depreciation. On the plus side, it reduces overall tax liabilities. On the negative side, however, it can prevent future deductions, especially in a financial year with low revenue.The Trump administration argued that ""bonus depreciation"" would increase investment, but according to the Center for American Progress, business investments slowed down dramatically by mid-2019 before plunging in 2020.High inflation benefits bonus depreciation by allowing companies to delay tax payments. For example, a company that delays a $100,000 tax bill until 2030 would effectively see its payment reduced relative to its value in 2022 due to the effects of inflation. This loophole allows corporations to avoid federal taxes for years, according to ITEP.""These tax breaks have no direct effect on the common population, but they have the indirect effect of reducing the revenue that the government has to invest in anything else like highways, education, defense, that might benefit Americans,"" Steve Wamhoff director of federal tax policy, told Yahoo Finance.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This can create a tax burden shift in which consumers are left with higher sales taxes and income inequality becomes more prevalent. In 2021, over 10% of government revenue relied on business taxes.“If you look at what has happened over the last 40 years, the bottom 90% has stagnated,” Nobel Prize economics professor Joseph Stiglitz said during a Columbia University panel discussion. ""The top 1% has done extraordinarily well.""President Biden’s Build Back Better Act (BBBA) increased taxes on companies with a “minimum tax” and individuals in the top tax brackets (earning above $400,000).Critics believed it will deplete investment incentives. But according to an analysis by Brookings, it will grow jobs by 2 million and help raise government revenue each year.""Inflation is a real issue affecting the lives of Americans,"" the ITEP report stated. ""Families everywhere are grappling with higher prices. It does them no good to provide a corporate tax break to reward businesses for making investments they would have made anyway.""—Tanya is a data reporter at Yahoo Finance.

CAG appears in a solid position, with its shares up 14% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rise of 11.2%. The consumer-packaged-goods food company has been benefiting from its efficient pricing efforts amid the rising cost inflation. Strength in the frozen business and gains from innovation have also been drivers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year earnings per share (EPS) has risen by a penny in the past seven days to $2.45. The consensus estimate for sales and EPS suggests a 5.8% and 3.8% increase from the year-ago period’s reported figures, respectively.Factors Backing Conagra BrandsCAG’s efficient pricing initiatives have been offering respite amid cost headwinds. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the price/mix improved 14.3% and aided the organic sales growth of 9.7%. The favorable price/mix was backed by the company’s inflation-induced pricing actions. The Price/mix rose 16.6%, 12.1%, 8.4% and 18.8% in the Grocery &amp; Snacks, Refrigerated &amp; Frozen, International and Foodservice segments, respectively.Conagra Brands Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseConagra Brands Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseConagra Brands price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Conagra Brands QuoteConagra Brands’ frozen and snacks categories remained particularly strong in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, delivering solid profit growth.

The company saw an improved share in frozen single-serve meals, plant-based protein and frozen breakfast.Conagra Brands has been strongly committed to undertaking innovation, the key to its success. Prudent innovations have been helping the company to modernize its portfolio and meet consumers’ changing needs aptly.Some of the company’s new products have been top-performing in several categories, such as toppings, plant-based protein and single-serve meals. Conagra Brands earlier said that it expects a sturdy performance from innovations in fiscal 2023.Further, CAG is seeing recovery in its Foodservice business as restaurant traffic is picking up with pandemic-led curbs being lifted and rising outdoor movement. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Foodservice segment’s sales advanced 14.6% to $274.9 million. The price/mix improved 18.8% on favorable inflation-driven pricing. With a continued rise in outdoor dining trends, the Foodservice business looks well-placed.Story continuesThe Bottom LineWe believe that efficient pricing, together with innovation, is likely to aid this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s sales in fiscal 2023.

The iconic consumer packaged food and beverage company’s pricing efforts are aiding amid an inflationary environment.Let’s delve deeper.Transformation Efforts on TrackKraft Heinz’s top-line momentum is driven by three pillars of growth, including Consumer Platforms, Foodservice opportunities and expansion in Emerging Markets. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it remains encouraged about sales growth in its segments, driven by its three growth pillars — GROW platforms in North America, Foodservice and Emerging Markets.In the third quarter of 2022, demand in GROW platforms across North America, including Taste Elevation, was solid. The company’s Foodservice business across North America and International Zone is growing faster than the industry. The company witnessed accelerated organic net sales growth across the emerging market.Management has been expanding its presence in Emerging Markets via a sustainable and repeatable Go-To-Market model delivering accelerated growth. In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Indústria e Comércio (""Hemmer""). In January 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). Management acquired the sauces-focused business — Assan Foods — from privately-held Turkish conglomerate Kibar Holding in October 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company is committed to accelerating its profit and boosting long-term shareholders’ value. As part of its transformation phase, management unveiled AGILE@SCALE in February 2022. The strategy will help Kraft Heinz to enhance its agile expertise and capabilities via partnerships with technology giants and cutting-edge innovators.Pricing Efforts SolidSolid pricing initiatives have been aiding Kraft Heinz for a while now. In third-quarter 2022, the company’s pricing rose 15.4 percentage points year over year, reflecting growth in both segments. The upside can be attributed to measures undertaken to counter increasing input costs. In the North America segment, pricing moved up 15.3 percentage points. The International segment’s pricing moved up 15.7 percentage points. Robust pricing efforts boosted the company’s quarterly net sales, increasing year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company generated net sales of $6,505 million, up 2.9%, while organic net sales increased 11.6%.Story continuesCost Hurdles on the WayIn the third quarter of 2022, Kraft Heinz’s gross profit of $1,843 million declined by 9.1% from the $2,028 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA fell 5.5% to $1,398 million, reflecting the adverse impact of divestitures and unfavorable currency translation. The company’s adjusted EBITDA was hurt by escalated commodity costs (particularly across dairy, soybean, packaging materials, energy and vegetable oils), supply-chain costs (including inflation across logistics, procurement and manufacturing costs) and an adverse volume/mix.In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects the industry to continue facing several headwinds like elevated input costs, ongoing supply chain challenges, currency volatility and increasing interest rates. Such headwinds continue to impact below-the-line costs and consumer health and consumption trends.That said, we believe that the above-mentioned upsides will likely keep working for Kraft Heinz. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have increased 18.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 11.2% growth.3 Solid Food PicksSome better-ranked stocks are The Chef's Warehouse CHEF, Conagra Brands CAG and McCormick &amp; Company MKC.The Chef's Warehouse, which distributes specialty food products, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Non-stop flights from Denver to Tokyo will commence from Mar 4, 2023. Return flights from Tokyo’s Narita International Airport to Denver International Airport will start taking to the skies from Mar 5, 2023.Initially, the service will be available three times a week. Flights will depart from Denver to Tokyo on Monday, Thursday and Saturday. Return flights to Denver will take to the skies on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Flights on the route will operate daily from Mar 25, 2023.We remind investors that the Denver-Tokyo route was suspended due to COVID-19. Prior to that, the route had been in operation since 2013. With air-travel demand bouncing back strongly from the pandemic lows, the decision of resuming this route is a prudent one and is likely to attract significant traffic. This will boost UAL’s top line.Earlier this month, United Airlines announced that it intends to restart flights to two other Asian destinations — Osaka and Hong Kong — from San Francisco International Airport. Both routes are expected to be operational by the beginning of 2023.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's lofty.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Target's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Target peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Target will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Target's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Target's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 46%. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 19% in total. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been mostly respectable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 18% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.3% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Target's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On Target's P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesWe've established that Target maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Plus, you should also learn about these 4 warning signs we've spotted with Target (including 1 which is significant).If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Target, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

SBF, as he's known, did not admit or deny guilt at that hearing.And Target has recalled over 200,000 weighted blankets after reports that two young girls died after crawling inside the items. According to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, the two children, aged four and six, died from asphyxiation inside the pillow fort blankets. The agency is urging users to return the blankets and ask for a full refund.And finally, possibly, a big shakeup in the media world. Axios reporting that Mike Bloomberg is interested in acquiring ""The Wall Street Journal"" parent company, Dow Jones, or potentially ""The Washington Post."" The reporting suggests, the billionaire wants to expand his media empire, and the Dow Jones would be potentially, the ideal fit. Really interesting here, as we look at this. It seems very preliminary, Soz, these discussions and Mike Bloomberg's desire to look at these companies, but obviously, it would make for a big change in the business and finance media world.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Right, Julie. Nothing in this report from Axios suggests a deal is going to happen tomorrow or the day after or maybe even in the first quarter, but this would just continue, the consolidation in this media industry. And the consolidation, by and large, has been driven by Dow Jones, going out there buying an IBD. Of course, they own Barron's, the long-time holder of MarketWatch here, but this would be a major, major deal. And, of course marry the likes of a ""Wall Street Journal"" with the amazing data platform-- that is the Bloomberg Terminal.JULIE HYMAN: Well, at the same time, as we have seen, some dealmaking being done by that empire, of course, we had the division of News Corp and FOX, now trading separately. There's been talk about, maybe, them coming back together, and the Axios report says that perhaps, would give an opportunity for a spin-off of Dow Jones of some kind. Again, this is very preliminary. Axios makes it clear that Mike Bloomberg knows Rupert Murdoch, who, of course, is controlling interest in News Corp, but that hasn't even brought it up to him, yet. So this is, like--BRIAN SOZZI: But other side is ""The Washington Post,"" they also mention.JULIE HYMAN: Yes.BRIAN SOZZI: This is another report I've seen over the past two or three weeks start to emerge, that Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder, may want to sell ""The Washington Post.""JULIE HYMAN: Maybe. I mean, let me be clear, as well. I am a former employee of Bloomberg, worked there for many years, and almost as long back as I can remember, there was discussion about some other kind of tie up with Bloomberg and another company, and nothing of that kind of magnitude ever materialized. There are some smaller acquisitions that the company has done, so take it-- take it with a grain of salt.BRIAN SOZZI: To be determined.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.]"

(NYSE:V) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 29x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Visa certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Visa peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Visa.How Is Visa's Growth Trending?Visa's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 24%. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 33% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 14% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.3% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Visa is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that Visa maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Story continuesYou always need to take note of risks, for example - Visa has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of Visa's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

The stock is down -5.4% this year, roughly in-line with the Mastercard's -5.3% pullback, but significantly better than the -20.7% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. Visa is undoubtedly faced with a number of near-term challenges, but it is well positioned for long-term growth on the back of numerous buyouts and alliances. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payment to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.The gradual revival of the global economy will keep driving consumer spending, expanding V’s business volumes in turn. Backed by a strong cash position, it remains committed to boosting shareholder value through share buybacks and dividend payments.(You can read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Texas Instruments have declined -12.1% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s decline of -42.7%. While Texas Instruments is faced with the same macroeconomic challenges that have brought down its peers, its business is lot more stable and resilient than other chip makers. Texas Instruments is benefiting from solid rebound in the automotive market. Further, solid demand environment in the industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a major positive.Additionally, solid momentum across Analog segment owing to robust signal chain and power product lines, is contributing well to the top line. Also, robust Embedded Processing segment is contributing well. Notably, solid investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)EOG Resources shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the past year (+44.9% vs. +28.4%). The company has an attractive growth profile, a huge inventory of drilling opportunities, upper-quartile returns and a disciplined management team. It has significant acreages in oil shale plays like Delaware, Bakken and Eagle Ford.The company estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations in those promising shale plays, brightening the production outlook. Also, EOG’s balance sheet is significantly less levered than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. EOG strongly focuses on returning capital to shareholders, as reflected in its plan to return $5.1 billion of cash this year through regular quarterly and special dividends.However, EOG Resources reported lower-than-expected third quarter earnings owing to higher lease and well expenses and transportation costs. Also, EOG is exposed to oil price volatility.(You can read the full research report on EOG Resources here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (PBR), Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (BAYRY) and Aflac Incorporated (AFL).Director of ResearchSheraz MianNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

However, constraints in the Japan business are a concern.Transformation Initiatives Aid Trane (TT), Low Liquidity AilThe Zacks analyst is positive about Trane Technologies' focus on improving its operating system and innovation through transformation initiatives. Low liquidity remains a concern.Robust Digital Sales Aid Yum! Brands (YUM), Cost HighPer the Zacks analyst, Yum! Brands benefits from robust digitalization.

Third-quarter comparable-store sales rose 15.4%.New UpgradesStrategic Buyouts, Higher Rates Support LPL Financial (LPLA)Per the Zacks analyst, LPL Financial will keep expanding through acquisitions driven a solid balance sheet position. Higher rates, solid advisor productivity and recruiting efforts will aid revenues.Diversified Portfolio and Strengthening Backlog Aid FLEXPer the Zacks analyst, Flex's performance benefited from strong revenue growth across all business segments owing to ongoing secular trends.

167,e77fe73b-80ae-3a4b-ace4-c187198272c8,MAR,2022-12-24,Avino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd.'s (TSE:ASM) Financials Are Too Obscure To Link With Current Share Price Momentum: What's In Store For the Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avino-silver-gold-mines-ltd-124418748.html,1671885858,STORY,"['ASM', 'GC=F', 'SI=F']","[Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' (TSE:ASM) stock is up by a considerable 42% over the past three months. However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines is:4.6% = US$4.4m ÷ US$97m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every CA$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated CA$0.05 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' Earnings Growth And 4.6% ROEOn the face of it, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 12%. For this reason, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' five year net income decline of 26% is not surprising given its lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 32% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Axios reporting Bloomberg is eyeing either ""Wall Street Journal"" parent company Dow Jones or the ""Washington Post,"" which is currently owned by Jeff Bezos.Allie Canal joining us now with the latest. Allie, what are we learning?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, that's right, David. According to this Axios report, Bloomberg is most interested in that Dow Jones acquisition due to its all-encompassing business coverage. You mentioned how Dow Jones is the parent company of the ""Wall Street Journal"" but also ""Barron's"" and MarketWatch. So pretty notable franchises there, especially within the finance world. However, the report did indicate that Bloomberg would be willing to purchase the ""Washington Post"" if Bezos was willing to sell.Yahoo Finance did reach out to both Dow Jones and the ""Washington Post."" A spokesperson for Dow Jones declined to comment, and the ""Post"" did not immediately respond.But another interesting layer to this story is the relationship between Michael Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch owns News Corp, which is the parent company of Dow Jones. He is close with Bloomberg. And we did receive a report back in October that Murdoch was considering a recombination of News Corp and Fox, which last split in 2013. Bloomberg, though, at least according to Axios, believes this recombination will fail, thus creating a possible opening, although he reportedly has not yet spoken to Murdoch about his interest.So it seems like this is still very early days but definitely something to watch heading into 2023.JARED BLIKRE: And, Allie, thinking about what else in the M&amp;A space may happen in media in 2023, just wondering what's on your radar? Because if I think back over the last 20 years, it seems like there's a major reshuffling about once every 10 years. That kind of occurs with the business cycle. You see a bunch of combinations, a bunch of split ups. What are we seeing for the new year?Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: I think we're definitely entering that period, Jared. There are signs that there's going to be more mergers and acquisitions in 2023. We've seen this push to profits, increased competition, companies just bleeding money, especially those traditional print entities, and M&amp;A is often looked at as a viable solution to those problems. Of course, the interest-rate environment, that could create some headwinds. But Wall Street is going to be on all of these companies' tails amid that profitability push.So other possible acquisitions to look out for could include Paramount Global unloading along with some of those smaller players like WWE, Curiosity Stream, Chicken Soup for the Soul, and then Disney. What are they going to do with Hulu and ESPN?So there is certainly a reckoning across the industry. The stock market has wiped $500 billion plus off of the media sector this year alone, and everything's on the table when it comes to this industry to try to recover from that and survive in the new year.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Allie Canal, good to see you.

The Journal has a Special Committee, set up under an agreement with its former owners, designed to safeguard editorial independence and ethical standards.Story continuesMr Bloomberg’s interest comes shortly after the British editor of the Sunday Times, Emma Tucker, was appointed to the top job at the Wall Street Journal, marking a further strengthening of ties between Mr Murdoch’s UK and US businesses.The move has also fuelled speculation that Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News UK, is being lined up for a senior role in the US.A takeover of the Wall Street Journal would underline efforts by Mr Bloomberg to build on his empire’s media offering and move away from its reliance on income from the Bloomberg Terminals used by traders.Subscriptions to the Terminal, which offers data, news and analysis to financial professionals, make up the majority of Bloomberg’s annual revenue of more than $10bn.The company would be able to integrate any takeover target with Bloomberg Media, its existing news outlet focused on business reporting.Bloomberg has previously beefed up its coverage by acquiring specialist news titles and market data providers.Mr Bloomberg would also consider buying The Washington Post from the Amazon founder Mr Bezos if it were up for sale, Axios reported.The Washington Post would represent a less natural fit for Mr Bloomberg, although a takeover would help to boost the organisation’s political coverage.The Post has said it will cut up to 250 jobs next year as it struggles to retain subscribers after enjoying a period of heightened popularity during Donald Trump’s presidency.A spokesman for The Washington Post said: “The Post is not for sale.”A Bloomberg spokesman dismissed the speculation and said “there is nothing to comment on”.News Corp declined to comment.]"

Google (GOOGL) took second with roughly $4.7 billion in tax breaks, followed by Meta (META) at $3.8 billion, Intel (INTC) at almost $3.3 billion, and FedEx (FDX) at $3.2 billion.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The 23 companies paid a combined $78.6 billion in federal corporate income taxes during that time, which was 8.9% of their $886.6 billion in reported profits. The standard corporate tax rate is 21%.On an individual level, the tax rates varied widely. For example, Duke Energy (DUK) had a negative tax rate of -10.6%, General Motors (GM) paid 0.2%, and Target's (TGT) rate was 15.9%.'The indirect effect' of reducing government revenueThe origins of the bonus depreciation tax cut began with a decade-old federal income tax law known as “accelerated depreciation,” which allows businesses to file for subsidized taxes for equipment not used as often and nearing old age.Then-President Trump took it a step further with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), creating the ""bonus depreciation"" law.From 2018 to 2021, the “bonus depreciation” law gave corporations additional tax breaks with the existing accelerated depreciation law. Companies could receive a full tax deduction the same year they purchased equipment or assets instead of making smaller deductions over a longer period of time as the equipment wore out.Story continuesFacebook/Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is seen in attendance during the UFC Fight Night event at UFC APEX on October 1, 2022, in Las Vegas. (Photo by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC)According to public accountants at Blue &amp; Co., there are pros and cons to utilizing 100% depreciation. On the plus side, it reduces overall tax liabilities. On the negative side, however, it can prevent future deductions, especially in a financial year with low revenue.The Trump administration argued that ""bonus depreciation"" would increase investment, but according to the Center for American Progress, business investments slowed down dramatically by mid-2019 before plunging in 2020.High inflation benefits bonus depreciation by allowing companies to delay tax payments. For example, a company that delays a $100,000 tax bill until 2030 would effectively see its payment reduced relative to its value in 2022 due to the effects of inflation. This loophole allows corporations to avoid federal taxes for years, according to ITEP.""These tax breaks have no direct effect on the common population, but they have the indirect effect of reducing the revenue that the government has to invest in anything else like highways, education, defense, that might benefit Americans,"" Steve Wamhoff director of federal tax policy, told Yahoo Finance.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This can create a tax burden shift in which consumers are left with higher sales taxes and income inequality becomes more prevalent. In 2021, over 10% of government revenue relied on business taxes.“If you look at what has happened over the last 40 years, the bottom 90% has stagnated,” Nobel Prize economics professor Joseph Stiglitz said during a Columbia University panel discussion. ""The top 1% has done extraordinarily well.""President Biden’s Build Back Better Act (BBBA) increased taxes on companies with a “minimum tax” and individuals in the top tax brackets (earning above $400,000).Critics believed it will deplete investment incentives. But according to an analysis by Brookings, it will grow jobs by 2 million and help raise government revenue each year.""Inflation is a real issue affecting the lives of Americans,"" the ITEP report stated.

You can skip our detailed analysis of scientific progress, the consequent technological benefits and 21st century scientific trends, and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Science. Science is the greatest tool required to solve some of the biggest problems humanity faces. Recently, the US Department of Energy announced a breakthrough in fusion energy. It was a net-gain in the energy output compared to the input energy that was used to heat the fuel source. The breakthrough is likely to result in increasing investment in fusion energy, accelerating further understanding and if the engineering and economic challenges are not great enough, it might lead to an effective fusion power plant by 2030. Economics of ScienceProgress in pure sciences results in the increase in technological output. For instance, the rocket equation, Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion and Newton’s laws of motion and gravitation together make space travel possible. Engineers use these laws for calculations relating to rocket design, its orbital mechanics and trajectory corrections.Technological growth, on the other hand, leads to greater economic output. In this sense, pure science is indirectly correlated to economic growth. In fact, it has been shown that correlation coefficient for Total-Factor-Productivity (TFP) and long-term economic growth in advanced economies is a strong 0.60, with technological output being one of the three main factors in TFP. Scientific Infrastructure Scientific research used to be limited to academia. However, as societies have become more complex, the infrastructure for scientific R&amp;D has also evolved, incorporating non-academic government institutes and private/public corporations as well. This is especially true in research surrounding AI. While research in the field is dominated by academia, corporate research comprises a meaningful 19.2% of the total AI papers published globally. In China and the EU, the second major share in AI-research comes from non-academic governmental institutes, at 15.6% and 17.2%, respectively. Story continuesScientific Trends, and Corporations/Institutes Dominating Them Going by the papers published by academic institutes and corporations, AI and biotechnology are the fastest growing scientific fields in the world. On Academic front, Harvard University, Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) dominate research in the US, with fractional-counts of 70.67, 39.85 and 37.69, respectively, in papers published in the Nature journal in 2018.On the corporate front, tech corporations like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominate R&amp;D in AI. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), through its subsidiary DeepMind, has designed deep learning algorithms like AlphaFold and AlphaTensor. The former has solved 98.5% of human proteins’ structures, which was a major problem for half a century. AlphaTensor, on the other hand, is designed to find novel methods for matrix multiplications, and is expected to speed up computers through discovery of new algorithms. On the other hand, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Novo Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are some of the prominent corporate names in biotechnology. Some of the biggest advances in science are happening in countries like the United States and Germany. Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of most advanced countries in science, we’ve ranked them based on the h-index score for their papers in 2021. The h-index measures the aggregate impact of scholarly output.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. KNSL and American International Group, Inc. AIG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Insurance Stocks That Have Outperformed the S&amp;P 500 YTDEconomic uncertainty worsened in the first half of 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, sluggish economic growth, rising interest rates, and soaring inflation. Improved pricing, increased technology advancements, exposure growth and global expansion as well as an impressive solvency level have been tailwinds for the insurance industry. Prudent underwriting standards, lower mortality rates and an improving rate environment have also added to the upside.The insurance industry has declined 0.4% year to date compared with the Finance sector's decrease of 16.5% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's decline of 21.1%.Here are four insurance stocks that have managed to perform well so far this year backed by their strong fundamentals.  Arch Capital Group Ltd., The Travelers Companies, Inc., Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. and American International Group, Inc. have outperformed the industry, the sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite year to date. These stocks are poised to retain the rally, given solid prospects.Factors at PlayPer Global Insurance Market Index released by Marsh, global commercial insurance prices increased 6% in the third quarter of 2022. It marked the 20th consecutive quarter of price increases. Per the Swiss Re Institute, the insurance industry is expected to generate premium growth of 2.1% on average over the next two years. A declining level of inflation, solid life insurance demand and market hardening in property and casualty lines should continue to support the growth.Story continuesAn expanded distribution, operational strength, higher retention, strong renewal, price increases, the appointment of retail agents, and a solid balance sheet have boosted insurers' momentum. The insurance industry players are well poised for growth on the back of higher new business premiums, growth in the line of business, increase in agency renewal written premiums, improving return on equity and non-cat property losses, and expanding international business.Diversified portfolio, which, in turn, lowers concentration risk, is also a positive. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, benefited sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, global life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023.The property and casualty insurance industry remains exposed to severe weather events that make underwriting results and in turn earnings volatile. Per Swiss Re Institute, natural catastrophe activity has resulted in insured losses of $115 billion in so far 2022, which is higher than the 10-year average of $81 billion. Swiss Re estimated Hurricane Ian as the most expensive one with estimated preliminary insured losses of $50 billion to $65 billion. Nevertheless, prudent underwriting, continued increases in pricing, reinsurance programs and favorable reserve development have helped to maintain underwriting profitability.A near-zero interest rate environment concerns insurers as it weighs on investment income, one of the important components of insurers' top line. A larger invested base, directing funds to alternative investments like private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, is expected to drive the metric in the future. Seven rate hikes have been implemented by the Fed so far in 2022. In the last monetary policy meeting of 2022, the Fed raised interest rates by 50 bps to the range of 4.25 to 4.5%.A solid capital position enables insurers to pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions, invest in growth initiatives, engage in share buybacks, and increase dividends or pay out special dividends. Mergers and alliances boost portfolios, diversify operations into new business lines and geography and have enabled them to enter more profitable market segments. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, the insurance industry witnessed 427 completed deals in the first half of 2022, which increased 16% year over year.The insurance industry players continue to invest in technology like robotic process automation, Chatbot and RoboAdvisory, artificial intelligence and data analytics, insurtech solutions, telematics, cloud computing. These investments have expedited business operations, enhanced internal efficiency and bolstered data and analytics capabilities and saveed costs which in turn will benefit margins.Solid Picks for Better ReturnsWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected four insurance stocks that rallied year to date and are poised to retain the momentum next year.Pembroke, Bermuda, Arch Capital Group is a leading specialty P&amp;C and mortgage insurer and offers insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance worldwide.

(NYSE:APD) insider's holdings were sold in the last year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-2-air-products-chemicals-120042779.html,1671883242,STORY,['APD'],"[Insiders were net sellers of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.'s (NYSE:APD ) stock during the past year. That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent sale by Sean Major was the biggest sale of Air Products and Chemicals shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$312. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Air Products and Chemicals Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Air Products and Chemicals. Specifically, Executive VP Sean Major ditched US$152k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Air Products and Chemicals Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Air Products and Chemicals insiders own about US$230m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Air Products and Chemicals stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Air Products and Chemicals is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

196,e93ebd9e-205a-3dee-bbaa-15a58d0c0ec1,FOX,2022-12-24,Michael Bloomberg reportedly interested in buying Dow Jones or the Washington Post,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/michael-bloomberg-reportedly-interested-buying-204254036.html,1671828174,VIDEO,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL', 'FOX', 'FOXA']","[Yahoo Finance media reporter Allie Canal details how media mogul Michael Bloomberg has shown interest in acquiring a competitor media company, while looking at the M&amp;A environment in the media space.Video TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg reportedly looking to expand his media empire. Axios reporting Bloomberg is eyeing either ""Wall Street Journal"" parent company Dow Jones or the ""Washington Post,"" which is currently owned by Jeff Bezos.Allie Canal joining us now with the latest. Allie, what are we learning?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, that's right, David. According to this Axios report, Bloomberg is most interested in that Dow Jones acquisition due to its all-encompassing business coverage. You mentioned how Dow Jones is the parent company of the ""Wall Street Journal"" but also ""Barron's"" and MarketWatch. So pretty notable franchises there, especially within the finance world. However, the report did indicate that Bloomberg would be willing to purchase the ""Washington Post"" if Bezos was willing to sell.Yahoo Finance did reach out to both Dow Jones and the ""Washington Post."" A spokesperson for Dow Jones declined to comment, and the ""Post"" did not immediately respond.But another interesting layer to this story is the relationship between Michael Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch owns News Corp, which is the parent company of Dow Jones. He is close with Bloomberg. And we did receive a report back in October that Murdoch was considering a recombination of News Corp and Fox, which last split in 2013. Bloomberg, though, at least according to Axios, believes this recombination will fail, thus creating a possible opening, although he reportedly has not yet spoken to Murdoch about his interest.So it seems like this is still very early days but definitely something to watch heading into 2023.JARED BLIKRE: And, Allie, thinking about what else in the M&amp;A space may happen in media in 2023, just wondering what's on your radar? Because if I think back over the last 20 years, it seems like there's a major reshuffling about once every 10 years. That kind of occurs with the business cycle. You see a bunch of combinations, a bunch of split ups. What are we seeing for the new year?Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: I think we're definitely entering that period, Jared. There are signs that there's going to be more mergers and acquisitions in 2023. We've seen this push to profits, increased competition, companies just bleeding money, especially those traditional print entities, and M&amp;A is often looked at as a viable solution to those problems. Of course, the interest-rate environment, that could create some headwinds. But Wall Street is going to be on all of these companies' tails amid that profitability push.So other possible acquisitions to look out for could include Paramount Global unloading along with some of those smaller players like WWE, Curiosity Stream, Chicken Soup for the Soul, and then Disney. What are they going to do with Hulu and ESPN?So there is certainly a reckoning across the industry. The stock market has wiped $500 billion plus off of the media sector this year alone, and everything's on the table when it comes to this industry to try to recover from that and survive in the new year.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Allie Canal, good to see you. Thanks so much.]"

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now with the breakdown.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thanks, Sozz. It's been a wild ride for media companies this year. Netflix down 50%. Disney and Paramount Global, same story there, down roughly 45%. But that's nothing compared to Roku, which has dropped 80% on the year with Warner Brothers, Discovery, and Spotify sinking more than 60%.And this year alone, the stock market wiped a whopping $500 billion-plus off of the market caps of major media giants with more pain expected in 2023. So how did we get here and what could happen next.? Let's start at the very beginning.2022, post-COVID, post stay-at-home train, and we saw subscriber growth levels slow. Netflix lost users two quarters in a row during the first half of the year, while NBC's Peacock saw zero growth at all in the second quarter. So amid that slowdown, coupled with those declines seen in linear television and a shaky macro environment, investors shifted focus to profitability. Are you a business that can make money?As a result, we saw massive amounts of layoffs, hiring freezes, massive restructuring efforts. And remember, these companies were spending tens of billions of dollars a year on just content alone. So it was a huge transition.But despite it all, there were some bright spots in 2022. Number one being ad supported. Netflix and Disney rolled out their respective ad tiers towards the end of this year. A lot of optimism on the Street when it comes to how advertising can help add incremental revenue and help hedge against churn, especially as competition intensifies.So that's something to look out for in 2023. Another highlight was that studios regained confidence in the box office. We had some record-breaking movies this year. ""Top Gun Maverick"" smashing a 15-year-old record. By far, the top movie of the year.Story continuesAnd then those Marvel films like ""Wakanda Forever,"" ""Doctor Strange,"" also killed it. Easily nabbing 100 million-plus openers. And even though ""Avatar 2"" did miss expectations, industry executives still say the film will outperform and continue to add box office dollars throughout the holiday season and into 2023. So theatrical, not fully back to those prepandemic levels but not as pessimistic as things seemed to be in 2021.And then finally another thing to watch will be more media mergers and acquisitions. As profitability is pressured, M&amp;A is often the go-to solution. There's lots of talk on the street that Paramount could be unloaded. Disney, what will Bob Iger do with ESPN and Hulu? And what about WBT? Could that be a potential acquisition target down the line?So there will be assets for sale. It's a direct result of this soul-searching moment for the industry. In 2023, it's going to be a year of tough decisions. And I think it's safe to say, not every media company is going to survive that.JULIE HYMAN: Well, I guess we'll see what that means for this coming year. That was Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal breaking down the year in media. We'll be watching to see what 2023, of course, holds for the industry.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: DCP Midstream, LP DCP, Conagra Brands CAG, Entergy Corp. ETR, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and Phillips 66 PSX.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Growth Stocks That Pay Solid DividendsSoaring inflation rate and interest rate hikes topped the list of adversities that ruled the U.S. economy in 2022, resulting in volatile stock market performance. The Federal Reserve recently raised the interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.25%-4.5% to curb inflation. The tightened monetary policy, looming fears of recession, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising commodity prices and supply-chain headwinds have compelled investors to look for safe and profitable investment options with growth potential.Why Growth Stocks?Growth stocks are a lucrative way to channelize the investments, as these stocks with above-average financial growth can easily capture the market's attention and generate higher returns. Investing in such stocks can fetch solid returns over the long and short run. Growth stocks include companies having the potential to exceed the overall market growth over time with higher profits and revenues.With the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it much easier to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Why Invest in Dividend-Paying Stocks?Investors generally look for safe and profitable stocks apart from focusing on growth investments. This is easily catered by stocks that pay regular quarterly dividends as these have a stable profit stream with a strong balance sheet. Investing in dividend stocks is also appealing for investors seeking a regular income stream or making wealth by reinvesting dividend payments into capital accumulation. Traditionally, dividend stocks are low-risk investments and are safe to hold.Story continuesApart from boosting profits and lowering portfolio risks for investors, dividend stocks offer fundamental analysis and tax advantages. Companies with high dividend yield, impressive payout ratio and sturdy earnings prospects can be great investment options for long-term returns.5 Solid Growth Bets Paying DividendsWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have narrowed upon five stocks with strong growth potential.

CHEF, Synopsys, Inc. SNPS, Enphase Energy, Inc. ENPH, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and Fabrinet FN.Buy 5 Stocks with Upgraded Broker Ratings for the New YearWith the turbulent 2022 coming to an end, it's time for investors to re-assess their portfolio and investment strategy for the New Year. While recent economic data point to the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high til inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors wary, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. At this stage, one way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc., Synopsys, Inc., Enphase Energy, Inc., ONEOK, Inc. and Fabrinet are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They meticulously assess companies' publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.Hence, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Here are five of the seven stocks that qualified for the screening:Ridgefield, CT-based Chefs' Warehouse is engaged in the distribution of specialty food products. CHEF's product portfolio includes nearly 50,000 stock-keeping units, such as specialty food products, such as artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars, truffles, caviar, chocolate and pastry products.Story continuesChefs' Warehouse's 2023 earnings are projected to grow 9.7%.

208,44616e41-6544-33e1-90d0-88e9586c4e3b,CL,2022-12-24,A Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) insider lowered their holding by 13% earlier this year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colgate-palmolive-company-nyse-cl-120049406.html,1671883249,STORY,['CL'],"[From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in Colgate-Palmolive Company's (NYSE:CL ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Colgate-Palmolive Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, John Kooyman, for US$200k worth of shares, at about US$77.06 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$79.45. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 13% of John Kooyman's stake. John Kooyman was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Colgate-Palmolive insiders own about US$68m worth of shares. That equates to 0.1% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Do The Colgate-Palmolive Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. Still, the insider transactions at Colgate-Palmolive in the last 12 months are not very heartening. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Colgate-Palmolive. For example - Colgate-Palmolive has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

209,95decbd1-ae17-314e-a5a0-9e9d3d96f442,CMCSA,2022-12-24,What Is Comcast Corporation's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Share Price Doing?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporations-nasdaq-cmcsa-share-120054591.html,1671883254,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Comcast’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Comcast What Is Comcast Worth?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 28.11x is currently well-above the industry average of 12.6x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Comcast’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Comcast generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Comcast's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? CMCSA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe CMCSA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CMCSA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for CMCSA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Comcast, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 4 warning signs with Comcast, and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in Comcast, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now with the breakdown.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thanks, Sozz. It's been a wild ride for media companies this year. Netflix down 50%. Disney and Paramount Global, same story there, down roughly 45%. But that's nothing compared to Roku, which has dropped 80% on the year with Warner Brothers, Discovery, and Spotify sinking more than 60%.And this year alone, the stock market wiped a whopping $500 billion-plus off of the market caps of major media giants with more pain expected in 2023. So how did we get here and what could happen next.? Let's start at the very beginning.2022, post-COVID, post stay-at-home train, and we saw subscriber growth levels slow. Netflix lost users two quarters in a row during the first half of the year, while NBC's Peacock saw zero growth at all in the second quarter. So amid that slowdown, coupled with those declines seen in linear television and a shaky macro environment, investors shifted focus to profitability. Are you a business that can make money?As a result, we saw massive amounts of layoffs, hiring freezes, massive restructuring efforts. And remember, these companies were spending tens of billions of dollars a year on just content alone. So it was a huge transition.But despite it all, there were some bright spots in 2022. Number one being ad supported. Netflix and Disney rolled out their respective ad tiers towards the end of this year. A lot of optimism on the Street when it comes to how advertising can help add incremental revenue and help hedge against churn, especially as competition intensifies.So that's something to look out for in 2023. Another highlight was that studios regained confidence in the box office. We had some record-breaking movies this year. ""Top Gun Maverick"" smashing a 15-year-old record. By far, the top movie of the year.Story continuesAnd then those Marvel films like ""Wakanda Forever,"" ""Doctor Strange,"" also killed it. Easily nabbing 100 million-plus openers. And even though ""Avatar 2"" did miss expectations, industry executives still say the film will outperform and continue to add box office dollars throughout the holiday season and into 2023. So theatrical, not fully back to those prepandemic levels but not as pessimistic as things seemed to be in 2021.And then finally another thing to watch will be more media mergers and acquisitions. As profitability is pressured, M&amp;A is often the go-to solution. There's lots of talk on the street that Paramount could be unloaded. Disney, what will Bob Iger do with ESPN and Hulu? And what about WBT? Could that be a potential acquisition target down the line?So there will be assets for sale. It's a direct result of this soul-searching moment for the industry. In 2023, it's going to be a year of tough decisions. And I think it's safe to say, not every media company is going to survive that.JULIE HYMAN: Well, I guess we'll see what that means for this coming year. That was Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal breaking down the year in media. We'll be watching to see what 2023, of course, holds for the industry.]"
212,13cdadb7-c78d-3683-9f5c-f782e27bd537,DVN,2022-12-24,Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporation-dvn-attracting-140002312.html,1671804002,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -11.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has lost 12.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.99 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +43.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 points to a change of +145.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.83 indicates a change of +2% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13%. The $19.91 billion and $19.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +67.1% and -2.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.7%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.58%. The EPS surprise was +2.35%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.59%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.53%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.45%.Heading into today, shares of the equipment rental company had lost 2.11% over the past month, lagging the Construction sector's loss of 1.63% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.33% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from United Rentals as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect United Rentals to post earnings of $9.93 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 34.37%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.29 billion, up 18.46% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $32.38 per share and revenue of $11.64 billion, which would represent changes of +46.78% and +19.78%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for United Rentals. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.35% lower. United Rentals is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Looking at its valuation, United Rentals is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 10.84. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.16, so we one might conclude that United Rentals is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that URI currently has a PEG ratio of 0.6.

This highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS' innovative cloud products and services.Notably, the contract will provide the U.S. Navy access to AWS’ commercial cloud environment and professional services. It will also be able to avail AWS training and certification courses.This $723.9 million deal comes right after the Pentagon’s recent declaration of Amazon, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Oracle ORCL as the winners of the multibillion-dollar cloud computing contract for the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. QuotePortfolio Strength – Key CatalystAWS’s growing efforts toward expanding its portfolio offerings are likely to continue adding strength to its customer base.Recently, AWS introduced a new data management service, namely Amazon DataZone, which eases the data management process and enables data producers to govern data access seamlessly.Further, the company bolstered its ML strength by introducing eight new capabilities for Amazon SageMaker namely, Role Manager, Model Cards, Model Dashboard, new data preparation, collaboration across data science teams, automated model validation, geospatial capabilities and Automatic conversion of notebook code into production-ready jobs.The company announced a new service called Amazon Security Lake, which is a purpose-built security data lake. It automatically centralizes an organization’s security data from cloud and on-premises sources into a purpose-built data lake.It also announced a fully managed compute service, namely AWS SimSpace Weaver, that enables customers to deploy spatial simulations to model dynamic systems with many data points.Further, it announced a new cloud application called AWS Supply Chain, which provides improved supply chain visibility to businesses.Additionally, it introduced a new analytics service called AWS Clean Rooms that helps customers analyze and collaborate on collective datasets without revealing underlying data.Story continuesBottom LineWe believe that portfolio strength will continue to drive AWS’ customer momentum, which, in turn, will aid Amazon in sustaining its cloud dominance. This will instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.Notably, Amazon has lost 43.6% on a year-to-date basis.Recently, AWS was selected by Yahoo as the preferred public cloud provider for the latter’s advertising technology business, Yahoo Ad Tech.Further, it was picked by Brookfield Asset Management as the preferred cloud provider. Also, Stability AI selected AWS as the preferred cloud provider. With the aid of AWS’s robust portfolio of cloud technologies and global infrastructure, Stability AI strives to build and scale its AI models.We believe that the expanding customer base will continue to drive AWS’s top-line growth. In third-quarter 2022, AWS generated revenues of $20.5 billion (16% of total sales), which grew 27% year over year.Further, expanding its portfolio and customer base will likely continue to aid Amazon, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), in gaining a competitive edge against its peers, Microsoft, Alphabet’s Google and Oracle, which are also making strong efforts to strengthen cloud footprint.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.According to the Canalys report, AWS accounted for 32% of global cloud spending in third-quarter 2022, maintaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.Microsoft’s Azure, which is currently riding on the robust adoption of its cloud offerings, increasing number of global availability zones and regions and strength in its consumption-based business, was marked as the second-largest cloud-service provider as it accounted for 22% of worldwide cloud spending.Alphabet’s Google Cloud, which is strongly gaining from a solid portfolio, expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions, represented 9% of cloud spending, making it the third-largest cloud provider.Meanwhile, Oracle continues to benefit from the solid momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and Autonomous Database offerings.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for McDonald's The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At McDonald'sThe Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$256 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$268. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was 53% of Ian Borden's stake.In total, McDonald's insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like McDonald's better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Have McDonald's Insiders Traded Recently?We have seen a bit of insider selling at McDonald's, over the last three months. insider Anthony Capuano only netted US$8.7k selling shares, in that period. Neither the lack of buying nor the presence of selling is heartening. But the amount sold isn't enough for us to put any weight on it.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of McDonald'sFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. McDonald's insiders own about US$183m worth of shares (which is 0.09% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At McDonald's Tell Us?We did not see any insider buying in the last three months, but we did see selling. However, the sales are not big enough to concern us at all. While we feel good about high insider ownership of McDonald's, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for McDonald's and we suggest you have a look.But note: McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like PACCAR (NASDAQ:PCAR). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide PACCAR with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for PACCAR PACCAR's Improving ProfitsEven with very modest growth rates, a company will usually do well if it improves earnings per share (EPS) year after year. So EPS growth can certainly encourage an investor to take note of a stock. To the delight of shareholders, PACCAR's EPS soared from US$5.04 to US$7.46, over the last year. That's a impressive gain of 48%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Our analysis has highlighted that PACCAR's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. PACCAR maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 22% to US$27b.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for PACCAR's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre PACCAR Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since PACCAR has a market capitalisation of US$35b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$621m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!Does PACCAR Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?For growth investors, PACCAR's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for PACCAR that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, issued a statement on the inclusion of SECURE 2.0 Act retirement legislation in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 passed by the U.S. Congress today.""We congratulate Congress for passing the bipartisan SECURE 2.0 Act, which improves individuals' ability to save for retirement, expands access to retirement plans, and eases plan administration for employers,"" said Dee Sawyer, head of Retirement Plan Services and U.S. Intermediaries. ""We are pleased to see many of the provisions we have supported become law, and we would specifically like to thank our Maryland Senator, Ben Cardin, for his leadership with retirement policy.""Among its highlights, the bill increases retirement savings through automatic features, enables matching contributions for student loan payments, permits older workers to save more and stay invested longer, simplifies disclosures, and provides credits for small businesses starting new plans. Unfortunately, the legislation failed to include important provisions that would have allowed participants in large 403(b) plans to enjoy the same lower costs that participants in larger 401(k) plans enjoy through the use of collective investment trusts.Sawyer added, ""By passing SECURE 2.0 Act, Congress has taken a meaningful step for the retirement security of all Americans. At a time when individuals and businesses are facing competing financial pressures, we are pleased to see legislation that enhances retirement savings opportunities for millions of Americans. We recognize that more can and should be done and we look forward to continuing to work with Senator Cardin and others in the future.""ABOUT T. ROWE PRICEFounded in 1937, Baltimore-based T.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United Parcel ServiceIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; Chief Marketing Officer, Kevin Warren, sold US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$192 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$176. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. Kevin Warren was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

(UPS): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-united-parcel-140002293.html,1671804002,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned -4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has lost 2.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $3.59 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.92 points to a change of +6.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.20 indicates a change of -5.6% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UPS, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $28.1 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $101.41 billion and $99.62 billion estimates indicate +4.2% and -1.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $24.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.2%. EPS of $2.99 for the same period compares with $2.71 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.65%. The EPS surprise was +5.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Conagra Brands CAG, Radian Group RDN, Lazard LAZ, NiSource NI and Citizens Financial Group CFG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy &amp; Retain for 2023Wall Street has seen jitters from the adverse macroeconomic scenarios in 2022, including rising inflation, commodity price increases, supply chain disturbances, Fed's strategy of interest rate hikes and, not to forget, the Russia-Ukraine tussle. This has dragged the stock prices of many companies in 2022, incurring portfolio losses for many investors. While the Fed's recent interest announcement has brought solace, it is still difficult to predict the market's future movement.In a jittery market, it is wise to constantly re-evaluate one's portfolio holdings and shuffle them by picking market-relevant stocks poised for future growth. Here, dividend-paying stocks turn out to be a good choice. Stocks paying regular dividends are large, stable and well-established.Companies generally payout dividends from their profits after securing enough funds for reinvestment in business operations, growth and expansion. This indicates that dividend-paying stocks are typically more secure and reliable.The dividend aristocrats, companies with a history of increasing their dividends annually for the past 25 years, are safe investment options for the long term.Although dividend stocks are reliable, a stock paying the highest dividend or having a high dividend yield may not always be a great option. A good way to evaluate a dividend stock is to analyze whether the dividend paid is stable. Also, companies with efficient management and a healthy balance sheet are considered good choices.Story continuesOur ChoicesWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have narrowed down on five cheap dividend stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.These S&amp;P 500 stocks have a dividend yield of more than or equal to 3%, as well as a five-year historical dividend growth rate of more than 0.

231,188b1b4a-6390-330b-b64f-ddd1962dd16a,VRTX,2022-12-24,Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) Shares Could Be 38% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vertex-pharmaceuticals-incorporated-nasdaq-vrtx-110057290.html,1671879657,STORY,['VRTX'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.00bUS$4.57bUS$4.95bUS$5.40bUS$5.73bUS$6.02bUS$6.26bUS$6.47bUS$6.67bUS$6.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 6.20%Est @ 4.94%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$3.8kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.7kUS$3.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$151bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$151b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$80bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$119b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$290, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.831. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Vertex PharmaceuticalsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Currently debt free.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Biotechs industry.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has awarded the deal.Details of the DealValued at $117.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will execute inspections, modifications and repairs on the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G jets.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.6% from the 2021 reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.62%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 4.1% from the 2021 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have lost 7.9% in the past 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 2.3%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:WM) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Waste Management The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Waste ManagementThe Executive VP &amp; COO, John Morris, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$168 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$159. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Waste Management didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Waste Management better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Waste Management Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Waste Management insiders own about US$110m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Waste Management Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Waste Management, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Waste Management.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Stryker's shares before the 29th of December in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 31st of January.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.75 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.78 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Stryker has a trailing yield of approximately 1.2% on its current stock price of $242.84. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Stryker Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Stryker paid out a comfortable 43% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 51% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Stryker's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Stryker earnings per share are up 8.1% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Stryker has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Stryker has increased its dividend at approximately 13% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineIs Stryker worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and Stryker paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.In light of that, while Stryker has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Stryker you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

238,9db7f0e0-2e01-3c8d-ae56-d39081dd573e,DVA,2022-12-24,Sell These 3 Stocks and Kick These Overpaid CEOs Out of Your Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sell-3-stocks-kick-overpaid-211804830.html,1671571084,STORY,"['AMZN', 'DVA', 'PAYC']","[If you’re thinking about which stocks to sell heading into 2023, you might want to start with companies whose CEOs are overpaid.The Financial Times published an article in mid-December discussing how to pay executives in the age of stakeholder capitalism. It pointed out that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy earned nearly $213 million, 6,474 times the median employee pay at the e-commerce juggernaut. Here’s a remarkable statistic: CEO pay in the U.S. between 1978 and 2021 grew by 1,460%, adjusted for inflation. Over the same period, the average worker’s compensation grew by 18.1%. CEOs’ pay grew 80x faster — no wonder the average Joe is having trouble keeping up with inflation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you own stock in companies whose CEOs and named executive officers consistently make the highest-paid lists, you might want to reconsider owning them because, much like the blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper’s stock page, a CEO’s contribution to the bottom line is overblown. “Every firm wants to believe its CEO is above average and therefore needs to be correspondingly remunerated. But, in fact, CEO compensation could be reduced across the board and the economy would not suffer any loss of output,” states pg. 17 of the Economic Policy Institute’s Oct. 4 paper on CEO pay. I’ll select these stocks to sell from companies whose CEO’s made As You Sow’s 2022 list of the 100 Most Overpaid CEOs. To narrow the field, these are companies whose stocks are down more than 15% in 2022, and their CEO’s pay was 399x their median employee or greater, the average of CEOs heading up the 350 largest U.S. companies by revenue.WBDWarner Bros. Discovery$9.03DVADaVita$70.82PAYCPaycom Software$303.69Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery company on smartphone screen.Source: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.comNext on this list of stocks to sell is a well known media conglomerate. Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is down more than 57% year-to-date through Dec. 16. Story continuesCEO David Zazlav was paid $37.7 million in 2020, 565x the median worker pay of $66,689. If that doesn’t make you sick to your stomach, the fact that Zaslav made $246.6 million in 2021, 2,972x the median worker’s pay of $82,964, should. And, while I realize Zaslav has to pull a rabbit out of his hat to realize the $202 million in options awards from his 2021 compensation, that doesn’t make it right just the same. Zaslav became Discovery’s CEO in November 2006. The company went public in September 2008 after Discovery Holding Co. — controlled by Liberty Media founder John Malone — and Advance/Newhouse Programming agreed to roll their stakes into newly formed Discovery Communications. Trying to calculate Discovery shareholders’ returns from its IPO in September 2008 through today isn’t easy, but I’ll do my best.Discovery’s Series C shares had a high of $16.87 and a low of $14.16 between Sept. 18, 2008 (IPO) and Sept. 30, 2008, for an average of $15.52. The company did a 2-for-1 split in August 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, a Series C share was worth an average of $34.22. At the end of December 2021, a Series C share was worth $22.90. Based on a cost of $15.52 and a market value of $45.80 ($22.90 x 2 shares), the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for Discovery stock between September 2008 and December 2021 was 8.7%. By comparison, the return for the S&amp;P 500 over the same period was 10.8%, 200 basis points higher.Fast forward to today.Warner Bros. Discovery stock started trading in April. Shareholders got one share of WBD for every share held in Discovery. Based on a $9.91 closing price as of Dec. 16, David Zaslav has produced a CAGR of 1.8% during his tenure. I don’t know the bigger noose around the company’s neck: David Zaslav’s excessive compensation or Warner Bros. Discovery’s $48.6 billion in long-term debt?DaVita (DVA)A DaVita (DVA) kidney care clinic in St. Joseph, Missouri.Source: APN Photography / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett has stuck by this operator of dialysis centers despite the fact DaVita (NYSE:DVA) has lost more than 36% in 2022 and made less than 1% over the past five years. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) first bought 2.7 million shares of DaVita stock in 2011. By the end of 2013, it was up to 36.46 million. Today, Berkshire holds 36.10 million shares valued at $2.61 billion. According to WhaleWisdom.com, Berkshire paid an average price over the years of $48.85. Based on the current share price, he’s still up approximately 48% on Berkshire’s 11-year investment. However, if Buffett had taken his advice and bought the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Exchange-Traded Fund Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), Berkshire would be up 205% over the same period. Javier Rodriguez has been DaVita’s CEO since June 2019. Before taking the top job, Rodriguez was the CEO of DaVita Kidney Care. He’s been with DaVita since 1998. The stock is up since taking the job; he took over at its five-year low. However, it is down significantly from its Aug. 2021 all-time high of $136.48. Why should investors consider this a contender for stocks to sell?The CEO’s total compensation for 2019 and 2020 was $90.2 million, with $68.5 million in 2020 option awards. In 2020, that was 1,137x the median worker’s pay of $64,620. The company tried to candy-coat the pay, suggesting it was $18.7 million, or a reasonable 289x worker pay. At the end of October, DaVita reported Q3 2022 results that were drastically lower than analyst estimates. On the bottom line, it earned $1.13 a share, 64 cents shy of the consensus. Consequently, it now expects to earn $6.45 a share in 2022 at the midpoint of its guidance, down from its previous estimate of $8.00 a share. It’s one thing to pay a CEO gobs of money when they’re producing; it’s another when they’re missing the mark by a country mile. In summary, Buffett can afford to be patient with his bets. You can’t. Find a better healthcare investment sooner rather than later. Paycom Software (PAYC)Source: STEFANY LUNA DE LINZY / Shutterstock.comThis last one in my stocks to sell list is a tough call to make. In October 2018, I included Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) in a list of seven tech stocks to buy for the future of human resources. Chiefly, the fact that Fortune ranked it fifth in its 2018 list of 100 fastest-growing companies was hard to resist. However, CEO and founder Chad Richison’s 2020 compensation is just too hard to ignore. Richison earned $211.1 million in total compensation in 2020, virtually all of it via stock and unit awards. Richison has been CEO since he founded the company in 1998. His net worth in 2021 was estimated to be $2.9 billion. Estimates put the future potential gains from his 2020 restricted shares at more than $2 billion. Not many founders seem to follow the Warren Buffett compensation plan — $100,000 annual salary and no options or stock grants — but Richison’s pay package in 2020 was approximately 12x the average S&amp;P 500 CEO in 2021.Richison took the company public in April 2014 at $15 a share. Its stock is up nearly 2,000% in the eight-and-a-half years since. There’s no question that shareholders who bought IPO shares and still hold them are more than happy with their returns. The evidence suggests that given the industry and timing, many other CEOs could have delivered the same results at a much lower compensation. There’s fair pay, and then there’s obscene pay. Richison’s is the latter. Forbes wrote an article in January 2020 highlighting what a great job he’d done growing the business. Subsequently, since that article, PAYC stock is up 9% over nearly 36 months. Down 23% in 2022, Richison has hardly earned his keep in recent times. It appears the easy money has already been made for Paycom shareholders, especially its CEO. The opportunity cost of waiting for Paycom to catch fire again is not worth it.Move on.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company's market value increased by US$4.5b as a result of the stock's 5.3% gain over the same period. In other words, the original US$5.5m purchase is now worth US$6.0m.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General ElectricIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp bought US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$81.79 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for General Electric share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 73.54k shares for US$5.5m. On the other hand they divested 1.44k shares, for US$107k. Overall, General Electric insiders were net buyers during the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. General Electric insiders own about US$218m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About General Electric Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like General Electric insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.Of course General Electric may not be the best stock to buy.

UNH, Cigna Corp. CI, Humana Inc. HUM and Centene Corp. CNC.Industry: Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2031334/4-hmo-stocks-in-focus-despite-tech-costs-nursing-shortageThe U.S. health insurance industry, commonly referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is likely to be aided by continued growth in premiums, a solid customer base and consistent contract wins. Despite its solid prospects, the industry has been grappling with escalating costs resulting from continued investments to bolster digital capabilities.A shortage of nurses and inflationary pressure continue to hamper the efficacies of HMO industry players. In spite of the prevailing challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc., Cigna Corp., Humana Inc. and Centene Corp. are better placed to navigate the industry downsides.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of its subscribers' basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance.Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO IndustryTechnology Investments Amid a Growing Digital Era: Players in the HMO space are compelled to undertake significant technology investments to stay abreast with the ongoing digital trend. These investments are often directed toward developing telehealth platforms through which the operational efficiencies of healthcare providers receive a boost. Telehealth platforms have exhibited solid demand since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as these offered healthcare services within the comfort of one's home.Story continuesThere are no signs of the demand receding and therefore it seems prudent on the part of HMO players to undertake digital investments. However, bringing its share of worries, these investments might escalate costs and dampen the margins of health insurers.Nursing Shortage: A notable headwind that has been troubling the U.S. healthcare industry for quite some is an acute shortage of nurses. Health insurers collaborate with several hospitals, as a result of which health plan members of the former can avail hospital treatments at discounted rates. Thereby, health insurers have to depend on nurses and other medical personnel for providing quality managed care services at hospitals per the unique needs of their clients.In the absence of a sufficient nursing workforce, a hospital's ability to deliver quality services might get affected, which, in turn, may indirectly impact the customer base of a health insurer. A McKinsey report, forecasting that the United States might witness a shortage of 200,000 to 450,000 nurses within 2025, further highlights the dismal scenario that awaits health insurers.Well-Performing Government Business: The health insurers devise affordable Medicare, Medicaid and Marketplace plans as part of the government business. Frequently, health plans are upgraded with attractive features to retain existing customers as well as attract new ones. Additionally, the HMO players remain on a spree to come up with advanced health plans as that might win them federal or state contracts from time to time.This, in turn, bolsters the customer base and leads to a steady rise in premiums. Increasing premiums bode well for the top line. However, amid the continued inflationary headwind that often takes a toll on the spending habits of consumers, the ability of consumers to continue paying for health plan premiums remains uncertain to some extent.An Aging U.S. Population: While an aging U.S. population might have been one of the factors contributing to the nationwide nursing scarcity issue, it has definitely been a blessing in disguise for health insurers offering Medicare plans. Meant to benefit people aged 65 or above, Medicare plans are expected to remain in solid demand on account of a growing aging population across the United States.According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, around 16.9% of the American population was aged 65 years or above in 2020 and the percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. In an effort to bolster the Medicare customer base, the industry participants even operate senior-focused centers for delivering quality care services to the medically vulnerable population.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group's  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical  sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #217, which places it in the bottom 12% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can buy or retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it's worth taking a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has gained 5.5% against the S&amp;P 500's 20.2% decline and the Zacks Medical sector's decrease of 20.1%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 19.33X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 17.01X and the sector's 22.45X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.48X and as low as 19.32X, with the median being at 20.2X.4 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting four stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Considering the current industry scenario, it might be prudent for investors to buy or retain these stocks in their portfolio, as these are well-placed to generate growth in the long haul.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.UnitedHealth Group: Based in Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group continues to benefit on the back of strong performances exhibited by its UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments. Several contract wins have resulted in membership growth for UNH. A solid financial position empowers UNH to undertake growth-related investments, which aim to expand its capabilities and solidify its nationwide presence. The healthcare provider has a solid telehealth platform in place that it has developed through continuous partnerships and significant investments. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have gained 6.5% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH's 2022 EPS indicates a 15.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure.

The bottom line of UnitedHealth Group outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average beat being 4.60%.Cigna: This Connecticut-based health insurer continues to benefit from the robust performances of its two well-positioned growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. It remains on track to achieve 10-13% average annual adjusted EPS growth on a long-term basis. CI's Government business is driven by continuous product expansions, rising membership and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems. Its shares have surged 47.5% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna's 2022 EPS indicates a 13% increase, while the same for revenues suggests 3.2% growth from the corresponding year-ago reported figures. CI's earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 9.84%.Humana: Growing premium revenues arising from an increasing customer base across its Medicaid and Medicare businesses continue to drive revenues of Kentucky-based Humana. The strength of the cost-effective Medicaid and Medicare health plans devised by HUM has fetched numerous contract wins and renewed agreements from Ohio, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin for the company. The CenterWell brand, together with Conviva, is part of Humana's Primary Care Organization, which is one of the largest senior-focused primary care providers in the United States. The stock has rallied 10.3% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HUM's 2022 EPS indicates a 21.4% increase from the prior-year reported number, while the same for revenues suggests growth of 11.9%. Humana's earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 10.41%.Centene: Based in Missouri, Centene's government business won numerous contracts in 2022. Notably, U.S. states like Louisiana, Indiana and Missouri, among others, awarded Centene Medicaid contracts. A strong cash reserve and a robust cash-generating ability to pursue growth-related initiatives. In December 2022, reflecting one of its growth-related investments, CNC collaborated with Community Health Development (CHDI) to establish a new community center in Texas for providing primary medical care and behavioral health services across the state. Even though its shares have lost 3.2% in a year, CNC's strong fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene's 2022 EPS indicates an 11.1% increase from the year-earlier reading. The consensus mark for current-year revenues indicates a 14.7% improvement from the year-ago actual.

247,007730a1-0840-33ee-8845-824000225146,PG,2022-12-24,15 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-companies-offer-pensions-143402543.html,1671806042,STORY,"['PEP', 'PG', 'PFE', 'MRK', 'ABT', 'ACN', 'LLY', 'COST']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest companies that offer pensions. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions. Working for a large company comes with several benefits that are sought by those seeking stability, prestige, and career growth. One such benefit is a pension or retirement plan, which guarantees a worker an income after retiring. This rewards the worker for their loyalty to the company and ensures that they do not have to look for employment in old age after spending the best years of their life at a specific firm.There are several different kinds of retirement plans that large companies offer their employees. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), these include Individual Retirement Agreements (IRAs), 401(k) plans, SIMPLE 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) among others. Another type of pension plan is the Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP). A key difference between a pension plan and a 401(k) plan is the contribution. For a pension, it is the employer who is responsible for contributing to the plan over the course of an individual's employment, while in a 401(k) plan, it's the employee who also has to make a contribution to the plan. Over the course of the years, the 401(k) has gained popularity, but sometimes, the employer also offers to match the employee's contribution to the plan. Another key difference between the two is that pensions generally offer a fixed income for life while a 401(k) plan offers variable income.How does a pension fund afford to make regular payouts to thousands of former employees? Well, these funds are invested in the stock market, and the return is distributed among the retirees. Pension investments are among the largest on Wall Street, and assets held by the top 300 pension funds touched a whopping $23.6 trillion in September 2022, marking an 8.9% annual growth. This growth comes at a time when stock markets have been hammered by soaring inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The U.S. has the highest percentage of assets under management (AUM) for pension funds all over the globe, as it accounts for 39.6% of the top 300 funds' AUM. North America as a whole is also a dominating player, as it accounts for close to half of the total assets.Story continuesIn terms of benefits distributions, public sector retirement plans distributed $323 billion annually in 2021, and a total of roughly 6,000 plans were present in the U.S. Out of these, the vast majority were made up of locally administered plans, and some even date back to the 19th century according to the Census Bureau.While pension plans are becoming less popular, some of the world's largest firms continue to have them, with notable examples being Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 15.8% loss over the past four weeks.Medical Properties’ largest hospital tenant, Steward Health Care, announced the extension of its ABL agreement with the lenders through December 2023. This led to increased investor optimism, driving the MPW stock.This health care real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.5%. Revenues are expected to be $383.28 million, down 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.While FFO and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in FFO estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Medical Properties, the consensus estimate for FFO per share for the quarter has been revised 1.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

With the ongoing inflation making out-of-pocket expenses more costly, people are depending more on products provided by companies like Aflac.Based in Columbus, GA, Aflac is one of the largest health care plan providers in the United States. It also has operations in Japan. AFL has a market cap of $64.3 billion.Can It Retain Momentum?The answer is yes and before we get into the details, let us show you how its estimates for 2022 stand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aflac’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $5.25 per share. Even though the 2022 estimate indicates a decline from the 2021 level of $5.94 per share, the metric is expected to turn around next year to $5.37 per share. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average of 4.8%.Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseAflac Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteThe consensus estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $19.2 billion, indicating a 13.4% decline from the 2021 reported level. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $17.9 billion. The decline in revenues is not expected to drag the bottom line primarily due to increased efficiency in operations. With improved sales in Japan, the top line is expected to improve in the future.Now let’s delve into what might drive this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.The company’s U.S. operations are targeting $1.8 billion in sales for 2025, with pre-tax profit margins reaching 17-20%. With strategic acquisitions, the company is expected to scale its business, going forward. It is leading the Worksite Supplemental Health market with a 29% market share. The company is expected to leverage its product portfolio and multichannel distribution to capture more market share.Story continuesInvestments in technology and innovations are likely to boost its digital footprint, drive efficiency and position it for long-term growth. In a recent analyst briefing, the company stated that of the 156 million U.S. working population, 7.2 million have Aflac products, leaving a massive growth opportunity.The Japan segment is expected to gain from productivity improvements at Japan Post Group. Its VISION 2024 strategy execution in the segment is likely to enhance coverage, launch products, become more competitive and address the needs of SME employees. It is targeting ¥80 billion in sales in 2025, with pre-tax profit margins reaching 26-28%.The company recently announced a dividend hike, reflecting its confidence in the stability of the base business, long-term prospects and solid financial position. Growth investments and productivity gains are expected to drive its results. It intends to enhance utilization and focus on the unserved market to expand its footprint.Aflac has a robust alternative investment portfolio. It resorts to interest rate hedging to protect its income and currency hedging to churn out capital and cost efficiency.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that might hold back the stock’s growth. Declining cash flows can affect its future operations. Its net cash from operations declined 31.9% year over year in the first nine months of 2022. Also, its forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 13.2X is higher than the industry average of 11.9X, marking it overvalued. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive the company’s long-term growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are MGIC Investment Corporation MTG, Unum Group UNM and NerdWallet, Inc.

252,30f6916c-ffad-3bb7-8866-3cb6e299cb47,SHW,2022-12-24,The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 79% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sherwin-williams-company-nyse-shw-140018044.html,1671804018,STORY,['SHW'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sherwin-Williams. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sherwin-Williams?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Sherwin-Williams already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Sherwin-Williams' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sherwin-Williams. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Sherwin-WilliamsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Sherwin-Williams Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$174m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Sherwin-Williams , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

This acquisition adds 525 water service customers to Illinois American Water’s existing customer base of 1.3 million.The aging of crucial water and wastewater infrastructure is concerning for the water industry of the United States. After completing the acquisition, Illinois American Water plans to invest nearly $5 million in the next five years to improve the overall water and wastewater infrastructure of the acquired assets.The acquisition of waste distribution assets from the City of Rosiclare will enable the company to increase its total water production and distribution channels and take adequate steps for an overall improvement in services. Incidentally, in 2020, Illinois American Water already acquired the City of Rosiclare’s water production and wastewater systems.Consolidation – A Must for Fragmented IndustryAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, at present, more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Due to a large number of small operators in the industry and a lack of adequate funds, at times, essential upgrades and repairs of infrastructure get delayed.Per the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. The breaks in the pipeline result in the wastage of 6 billion gallons of potable water each day and add to the losses of water utility operators. Aging and a lack of timely maintenance are major contributors to pipeline breaks.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments for the upgrade of infrastructure and the continuation of high-quality services for customers. American Water Works continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.Story continuesUtilities Continue to ConsolidateAmerican Water Works is expanding its customer base through organic initiatives and acquisitions. It continues to focus on the acquisition of utilities that provide services to 5,000-50,000 customers. Through 15 closed acquisitions, the company added 51,000 customers to its existing customer base. AWK’s pending acquisitions (as of Sep 30, 2022), when completed, will add another 65,300 customers to its base. Other water utilities like California Water Service Group CWT, SJW Group SJW and Essential Utilities WTRG, among others in the water utility space, are expanding operations through systematic acquisitions.California Water Service recently received approval to acquire the water system assets of Skylonda Mutual Water Company. The buyout is scheduled to close later this year, subject to customary closing conditions. Also, in June 2022, CWT announced that its unit, Texas Water Service, closed the acquisition of Railyard Utility’s wastewater system by collaborating with BVRT Utility Holding Company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for California Water Service's 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 21.7%. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.63%.SJW Group completed more than 25 acquisitions in the 2010-2021 time frame and expanded operations. In January 2022, it closed the acquisition of Texas Country Water in Comal, TX. The deal added more than 1,900 water and wastewater customers to the existing customer base. This has been the fourth Texas acquisition by SJW Group in the past 12 months. In the next five years, the company plans to invest $1.5 billion to further strengthen its infrastructure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SJW Group's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 15.3% and 6.6%, respectively. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.8%.In the six years ended Dec 31, 2021, Essential Utilities expanded utility operations by completing many water and wastewater acquisitions, which, in turn, added 94,000 customers. In the first nine months of 2022, WTRG completed two acquisitions, which added 19,175 customers. Essential Utilities plans to invest $3 billion from 2022 through 2024 to fortify operations and efficiently serve the expanding customer base.Essential Utilities’ long-term earnings growth is currently pegged at 6.2%.

255,007730a1-0840-33ee-8845-824000225146,PEP,2022-12-24,15 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-companies-offer-pensions-143402543.html,1671806042,STORY,"['PEP', 'PG', 'PFE', 'MRK', 'ABT', 'ACN', 'LLY', 'COST']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest companies that offer pensions. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions. Working for a large company comes with several benefits that are sought by those seeking stability, prestige, and career growth. One such benefit is a pension or retirement plan, which guarantees a worker an income after retiring. This rewards the worker for their loyalty to the company and ensures that they do not have to look for employment in old age after spending the best years of their life at a specific firm.There are several different kinds of retirement plans that large companies offer their employees. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), these include Individual Retirement Agreements (IRAs), 401(k) plans, SIMPLE 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) among others. Another type of pension plan is the Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP). A key difference between a pension plan and a 401(k) plan is the contribution. For a pension, it is the employer who is responsible for contributing to the plan over the course of an individual's employment, while in a 401(k) plan, it's the employee who also has to make a contribution to the plan. Over the course of the years, the 401(k) has gained popularity, but sometimes, the employer also offers to match the employee's contribution to the plan. Another key difference between the two is that pensions generally offer a fixed income for life while a 401(k) plan offers variable income.How does a pension fund afford to make regular payouts to thousands of former employees? Well, these funds are invested in the stock market, and the return is distributed among the retirees. Pension investments are among the largest on Wall Street, and assets held by the top 300 pension funds touched a whopping $23.6 trillion in September 2022, marking an 8.9% annual growth. This growth comes at a time when stock markets have been hammered by soaring inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The U.S. has the highest percentage of assets under management (AUM) for pension funds all over the globe, as it accounts for 39.6% of the top 300 funds' AUM. North America as a whole is also a dominating player, as it accounts for close to half of the total assets.Story continuesIn terms of benefits distributions, public sector retirement plans distributed $323 billion annually in 2021, and a total of roughly 6,000 plans were present in the U.S. Out of these, the vast majority were made up of locally administered plans, and some even date back to the 19th century according to the Census Bureau.While pension plans are becoming less popular, some of the world's largest firms continue to have them, with notable examples being Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco).Photo by Esther Tuttle on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a look at dozens of companies that still have pension plans, following which they were ranked according to their market capitalization.15 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions15.

Lunsumio has been approved by the regulatory agency under the accelerated pathway.Following approval, Lunsumio is the first CD20xCD3 T cell engaging bispecific antibody approved in the United States for the treatment of FL. The medication was approved for a similar indication in the European Union earlier this June.The FDA’s approval is based on positive data from the phase II GO29781 study, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Lunsumio in patients with heavily pre-treated R/R FL. Data from the study showed high and durable response rates in study participants following treatment with Lunsumio. An objective response was observed in 80% of study participants who received Lunsumio, with 60% of participants achieving complete remission.An off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy, Lunsumio will help treat patients who do not respond to multiple lines of treatment and help them achieve disease remission. A commercial launch for the therapy is expected in the coming weeks.Shares of Roche have declined 23.5% this year against the industry’s 12.2% increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFL is the most common slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Per management estimates, more than 100,000 people across the globe are diagnosed with FL. There are very limited treatment options for FL patients, especially those who relapse.Lunsumio was developed by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. The antibody is also being evaluated in late-stage studies for treating early-line NHL.Lunsumio has been developed by Roche in collaboration with Biogen BIIB. Earlier this February, Biogen exercised an option to participate in the development and commercialization of Lunsumio. Following the exercise of this option, Biogen will share profits and losses of Lunsumio in the United States in the low to mid-30% range and also be eligible to receive royalties in the low-single-digit range in ex-U.S. markets. In return for receiving this right, Biogen made a one-time payment of $30 million to Roche and also paid a portion of the development expenses incurred by Roche on Lunsumio in 2021.Story continuesLike Roche, many companies like AbbVie ABBV and Regeneron REGN are also developing their respective CD20xCD3 bispecific antibodies targeting NHL indications.AbbVie is developing epcoritamab, its own CD20xCD3 T cell engaging bispecific antibody, in collaboration with Genmab for treating adult patients with R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Last month, Genmab and Roche announced that the FDA accepted the company’s regulatory filing seeking approval for epcoritamab in R/R LBCL. A decision is expected before May 2023-end.Regeneron is currently evaluating its own CD20xCD3 antibody odronextamab in patients with FL indication. Earlier this month, Regeneron announced topline data from a pivotal phase II study, which evaluated odronextamab in heavily pre-treated R/R FL patients. Data from the study showed an 82% response rate in patients, including 75% of participants achieving a complete response. Based on this data, Regeneron will make a regulatory submission to the FDA next year.Roche Holding AG Price Roche Holding AG PriceRoche Holding AG price | Roche Holding AG Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The trial evaluated Libtayo compared to an investigator's choice of chemotherapy and enrolled 608 patients across 14 countries, including Japan, irrespective of PD-L1 expression status or histology. In March 2021, the trial was stopped early based on the highly significant effect of Libtayo on overall survival among squamous cell carcinoma patients following a unanimous recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee.""With Libtayo, Japan now has an approved treatment option that has demonstrated significant survival benefits in this cervical cancer patient population compared to chemotherapy irrespective of PD-L1 expression – a milestone no other PD-1 inhibitor has achieved in a Phase 3 trial,"" said Prof. Kosei Hasegawa, Gynecologic Oncology, Saitama Medical University International medical Center, a trial investigator and a member of NRG Oncology-Japan. ""We are proud to have contributed to bringing this new treatment option to women living with this difficult-to-treat cancer in Japan.Story continuesCervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and is most frequently diagnosed in women between the ages of 35 and 44. Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. It is estimated that approximately 600,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and 350,000 deaths from cervical cancer occur worldwide each year.In November 2022, Libtayo was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T cells and was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. In the U.S. and other countries Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced CSCC and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in advanced cervical cancer in Japan, the European Union, Canada and Brazil.Libtayo was jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. As of July 1, 2022, Regeneron is responsible for the development and marketing of Libtayo globally. In Japan, Libtayo is currently marketed by Sanofi on Regeneron's behalf over the course of a defined transition period.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. FDA-approved IndicationsLibtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat:--  People with a type of skin cancer called CSCC that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.--  People with a type of skin cancer called BCC:That cannot be removed by surgery (locally advanced BCC) and have received treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI), or cannot receive treatment with an HHI.That has spread (metastatic BCC) and have received treatment with an HHI, or cannot receive treatment with an HHI. This use is approved based on how many patients responded to treatment and how long they responded. Studies are ongoing to provide additional information about clinical benefit.--  Adults with a type of lung cancer called NSCLC:Libtayo may be used in combination with chemotherapy that contains a platinum medicine as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, OR your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), AND your tumor does not have an abnormal ""EGFR"", ""ALK"" or ""ROS1"" gene.Libtayo may be used alone as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, OR your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), AND your tumor tests positive for high ""PD-L1"", AND your tumor does not have an abnormal ""EGFR"", ""ALK ""or ""ROS1"" gene.It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTSWhat is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?Libtayo is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system.

258,b3a37ca5-f3b5-32ed-8317-0163e714fdbd,UNP,2022-12-24,Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 76% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-corporation-nyse-unp-120024949.html,1671883224,STORY,['UNP'],"[A look at the shareholders of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 76% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Union Pacific. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Union Pacific?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Union Pacific does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Union Pacific's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Union Pacific. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.6% and 4.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Union PacificWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Union Pacific Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$196m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Union Pacific. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

The company has raised its 2022 view, which buoys optimism. However, market headwinds and stiff competition remain concerns.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 6.9% compared with the 30.6% decline of the industry and 20.7% drop of the S&amp;P 500.The largest provider of commercial laboratory services in North America has a market cap of $17.72 billion. The company surpassed estimates in the trailing three quarters and missed the same in one, the average surprise being 5.81%.Let us delve deeper.Factors At PlayImpressive Q3 Results: Quest Diagnostics reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 earnings and revenues. The company drove 5% growth in the base business despite the impact of Hurricane Ian. Performance rebounded in August and September from a softer volume trend that it witnessed earlier in the year. Before Hurricane Ian hit in September, Quest Diagnostics witnessed some of its historically highest base testing volumes.Base Volume Improves: Quest Diagnostics’ base testing volumes or base business refers to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 testing. The company’s legacy base business grew 5.1% in the third quarter amid softer utilization trends, which impacted the entire healthcare industry. During the reported quarter, base business revenue per requisition was up 3.3%. The more favorable pricing environment remained consistent with the company’s expectations, with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter.The company also ramped up investments to accelerate growth in the base business, particularly in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. In the third quarter, the company continued to expand growth through health plan access. Quest Diagnostics noted that it is on track to meet its goal of realizing 50% of its health plan revenues from value-based relationships by the end of 2023.Story continuesRaised Guidance: The company raised its full-year 2022 guidance.Full-year net revenues are currently estimated in the range of $9.72-$9.86 billion (compared with the earlier projection of $9.50-$9.75 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged lower at $9.66 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $9.75-$9.95 (the earlier guidance was $9.55-$9.95). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $9.67DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition from LabCorp, other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market compared to Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including the accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs primarily based on the quality of service.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrent Market Headwinds Weigh Heavy: The current market environment remains challenging for Quest Diagnostics due to a persistent decline in healthcare utilization rate, softer volume, commercial pricing pressure and reimbursement headwind.Estimate TrendsQuest Diagnostics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for the current year. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 2.2% north to $9.85.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $9.80 billion, suggesting a 9.2% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are ShockWave Medical, Inc.

263,2a51349d-36ef-36dd-aa2e-a81da1602f11,CSCO,2022-12-24,Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Is Investing Its Capital With Increasing Efficiency,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-nasdaq-csco-investing-110119960.html,1671879679,STORY,['CSCO'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Cisco Systems:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$14b ÷ (US$93b - US$25b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, Cisco Systems has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Communications industry average of 8.7%. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems roceIn the above chart we have measured Cisco Systems' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Cisco Systems here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEYou'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at Cisco Systems. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 68%. The company is now earning US$0.2 per dollar of capital employed. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 33% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets.The Key TakeawayIn the end, Cisco Systems has proven it's capital allocation skills are good with those higher returns from less amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a solid 44% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

264,0c98a728-0bf8-37f3-afbe-740ba97b2889,CSCO,2022-12-24,7 Stocks to Buy on Weakness for Big Gains,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-weakness-big-202157380.html,1671567717,STORY,"['GM', 'ALB', 'CSCO', 'NIO', 'UBER']","[The U.S. stock market has been spooked by actions of the Federal Reserve. However, as Barron’s pointed out, “Despite the most rapid tightening of financial conditions in a generation, and the turmoil in financial markets, the U.S. economy is entering 2023 in decent shape.” With the labor market and America’s dominant services sector still both strong, there’s little reason to believe the economy won’t keep growing meaningfully if the Fed tightens 1.3 percentage points more next year. And, I continue to believe that long-term investors should look for stocks to buy on weakness.AURAurora Innovation$1.24NIONio Inc.$11.15GMGeneral Motors$35.26ALBAlbemarle$233.40DRIDarden Restaurants$139.63JPMJPMorgan$131.11CSCOCisco$47.31Aurora Innovations (AUR)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAurora (NASDAQ:AUR) continues to make big strides in its self-driving truck niche. Most recently, Uber’s (NYSE:UBER) freight unit decided to expand its trial with Aurora. Specifically, in Oct., trucks within Uber Freight’s network began hauling freight between Fort Worth, Texas and El Paso, Texas utilizing Aurora’s self-driving technology . Previously, such trucks traveled only between Dallas and Houston, a significantly shorter route.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsImpressively, Aurora appeared to indicate that the trucks are traveling without any drivers for a portion of the 600-mile route between Fort Worth and El Paso. “The packages…. complete their journey via human drivers who handle the first and final leg of customer deliveries across western Texas and New Mexico,” the company stated in its press release announcing the expansion of its trial with Uber Freight.With Uber and Aurora having significantly expanded their trial and the trucks apparently traveling without human drivers over a large part of the route, it appears that Aurora’s self-driving technology is performing very well. AUR plans to commercialize its self-driving software for trucks in 2024.Story continuesNio (NIO)Shanghai.China-Feb.2021: exterior of NIO store. A Chinese electric car brandSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.comNio (NYSE:NIO) stock has also been weak, but presents us with another one of the top stocks to buy on weakness. Even though the automaker delivered an 14,178 EVs in Nov. – a 30% jump year over year – it’s been weak. Also worth noting is that the automaker reported that it intended to accelerate its production and deliveries for Dec. In addition, with China’s anti-coronavirus measures easing and its supply chain consequentially improving, the macro environment should become more favorable for Nio in the coming months.On Nov. 17, Barclays trimmed its price target on NIO to $18 from $19 but maintained an “overweight” rating on the shares. The firm was upbeat on the company’s new EVs and the expansion of its production capabilities.General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) continues to make impressive progress on its ongoing transformation into an exclusively electric-vehicle maker.The automaker plans to produce 1 million EVs in North America by 2025 and 2 million EVs worldwide by that year, while it is making progress on moving towards producing its own batteries and launching many, new types of EVs. In 2023, the automaker intends to launch EV versions of its Silverado truck and its Blazer EV, al;ong with an affordable EV SUV. The success that GM has already had selling its Bolt, Lyriq, and Hummer EVs shows that it can become a successful EV maker. Moreover, GM forecasts that BrightDrop, the automaker’s unit which manufactures electric delivery vehicles, will generate $1 billion of sales in 2023.In addition, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the company’s decision to build its own batteries will boost its profitability and enable the automaker to equip its EVs with ” a reliable and impressive powertrain.” The analyst increased his price target on GM stock to $46 from $42 on Nov. 21 and kept an “outperform” rating on the shares.Albemarle (ALB)Lithium element on the periodic table. LITM Stock.Source: tunasalmon / ShutterstockLithium miner Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) continues to take steps to expand its capacity, as the company announced on Dec. 13 that it would launch a new lithium mining R&amp;D facility in North Carolina. The company says that the facility will develop techniques that will enable it to boost the yields from its lithium mines and help ALB produce lithium that is better suited for electric vehicles’ batteries. Meanwhile, ALB, quite reasonably expects lithium prices to remain elevated as the Democrats’ climate law spurs more adoption of EVs in the U.S. starting in 2023.Analysts have a median price target on ALB of $320, versus its closing price on Dec. 19 of $235. And on Nov. 8, RBC Capital, a Canadian bank, raised its price target on ALB to $380 from $371 while keeping an “outperform” rating on the shares. The firm believe that the lithium supply-demand dynamic is favorable for ALB.Darden Restaurants (DRI)A person cooks something in a smoking wokSource: ShutterstockOn Dec. 16, indicating that recessionary fears and worries about the weakness of American consumers is greatly exaggerated, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) reported strong third-quarter results. Of course, the company’s earnings also showed that its business has been performing well.The company, owns several restaurants chains, including the Olive Garden Italian chain, Longhorn Steakhouse, and Bahama Breeze, noted that its same-restaurant sales jumped 7.3% year-over-year, while its total sales climbed 9.4% year over year.  EPS jumped 2.7% year over year to $1.52. Moreover, the restaurant owner’s top and bottom lines came in meaningfully ahead of analysts’ average estimates, and, showing its confidence in the outlook of DRI stock, the company bought back $100 million of its own shares last quarter. Next quarter, the company expects its cost pressures to drop, increasing its margins.JPMorgan (JPM)image of businessman holding a fiery arrow that's heading in an upward trajectorySource: ShutterstockJPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is also well-positioned to benefit from America’s rising interest rates and better-than-widely-believed economic outlook. As a result, it’s not surprising that Morgan Stanley issued a “double upgrade of JPM stock on Dec. 6, raising its rating on the shares to “overweight” from “underweight.” Morgan Stanley also expects JPM’s revenue to grow faster than its operating expenses going forward. In addition, the firm noted that JPMorgan expects its net interest income to come in at roughly $74 billion in 2023. Also noteworthy is that JPMorgan’s Nov. credit card delinquency rate remained unchanged versus October at 0.73%, while its net charge off rate rose in November but was still well below its level of November 2019.JPM has a significant dividend yield of 3.05%, while its forward price-earnings ratio is a low 10.2 and the shares have dropped 3.7% in the last month and 18% this year.Cisco (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported strong fiscal first-quarter results on Nov. 16. Revenue climbed 5.7% year-over-year to $13.63 billion, $340 million over analysts’ average estimates. On the bottom line, EPS was up 5% year over year to 86 cents, as compared to estimates for 84 cents. For fiscal 2023, Cisco expects its revenue to increase 4.5% to 6.5% year over year, as well. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins noted that the company’s Q1 revenue set a quarterly record for the tech giant, while its bottom line came in at the second-highest level in its history.Investment bank Cowen reacted to the results by raising its price target on the name to $61 from $60 and keeping an “outperform” rating on the shares. The firm says that the company’s revenue prognosis has become more favorable.CSCO stock has dropped 4,.5% in the five days that ended on Dec. 19, while it has a 3.21% dividend yield and a low forward price-earnings ratio of 13.5.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AUR.
